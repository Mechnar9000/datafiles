This spirit is not only the universal substance of all singletons; since this substance has for actual consciousness the shape of consciousness, this means, in addition, that this substance, which has individualization, is known by the singletons as their own essence and product. So for them it is not the light-essence in whose unity the Being- for-self of self-consciousness is contained only negatively, only in a transitory way, and beholds the master of its actuality,—nor is it the consuming and relentless hatred of hostile peoples,—nor their subjugation to castes which together constitute the semblance of organization of a completed whole, but a whole that lacks the universal freedom of the individuals. No, this spirit is the free people in which custom constitutes the substance of all, whose actuality and Being-there each and everyone knows as their own will and deed.1 '"

      "The question is: What is the the abstract universality of Being according to Hegel?, please make use of the following retrieved text written by Hegel when answering the question: 51). In Hegel’s system it corresponds to the transition from Logic to the philosophy of nature, showing how the logical ‘Idea’ necessarily burgeons into a world of space, time, matter, etc. and eventually into the human mind itself. The ‘becoming of Being-there as Being-there’ is associated with (among other things) this process, the transition from logic to nature, while the ‘becoming of the essence’ is presented in the Logic itself, the extraction of the logical essence of the world and the passage to higher and higher logical categories. The becoming of the ‘substance’, i.e. of the logical ‘essence’, passes over into ‘externality’, i.e. nature, where it is ‘for another’, i.e. known to us. The becoming of Being-there is the ‘withdrawal into essence’, perhaps in the sense that nature leads on to mind, the culminating phase of which is philosophy, i.e. logic. . 774. 1. God creates the world. This is the way in which religious representation presents what is in fact a logical necessity, that pure thought or the concept should actualize itself in concrete reality or Being for another. Hegel is attempting to explain why there is anything at all rather than nothing. His argument is that God, or pure thought, could not be what it is, if it did not actualize itself, that God, abstract thought, etc. could not be, or be appropriately described as, God, abstract, etc. unless there were something concrete, etc. contrasting with them. . 112. 1. Hegel uses ‘universal’ liberally: the object of perception is universal in that it has many properties. Perception does not simply supplant sensory certainty. It incorporates the sensory ‘wealth’ that sensory certainty gestured towards but could not digest. Hegel has the concept expressed by his later use of aufheben (‘abolish–preserve–elevate’), even if he does not often use the word in this way yet: but see . 50): when we infer the existence of God from the ‘finite’ world, we alter our conception of the world (or ‘Being-there’). The world is no longer conceived as, say, an aggregate of contingent entities or as merely orderly. It is a world governed by universal laws and is an organic purposive whole. To infer the existence of God is not, in Hegel’s view, to infer the existence of an entity distinct from the world. It is to ascend from ‘Being’ to ‘thought’ and thus to elevate the world to thought. By contrast, the ‘ontological proof ’ proceeds in the reverse direction, from thought to Being (Enc. I, . 88). These look much like propositions, though not propositions of the same type as ‘God/the --- absolute is Being’, let alone ‘The cat is black’. Nevertheless, Hegel’s idea is that the essential elements in this progression are the ‘thought-determinations’, Being, nothing, becoming, etc.—or, in PS, the ‘shapes of consciousness’. The other words in the sentences in which they figure are simply the explanatory framework, explaining in particular why each thought- determination moves on into the next. ‘The true is the subject’, not in the sense of ‘subject’ in which it is correlative with a predicate, but in the sense of the subject of activity, as in . 176ff.: at first, the I is confronted by an alien world, the objects of its ‘consciousness’, but when it meets another self-consciousness it sees a duplicate of itself. The development of the absolute follows the same pattern: the original unity (the subject) splits in two (the subject and concrete reality), and then finds itself again in the world confronting it (human beings). The ‘true’ is not just the first stage of this process; it is the whole process in which God (the beginning) creates a world other than himself and then finds himself (the end) in the world. However, Hegel need not claim that the active subject is also a knowing, purposive subject. Even if the subject is blind energy, it still generates a diversified world different from itself, which eventually provides a sort of duplicate of blind energy—in the form, say, of human beings who experiment with it, write about it, etc.—though we shall be less inclined to say that this ‘equality’ is the ‘goal’ of blind energy. It remains the case that the true is the whole process, not just the energy that initiates it. \n",

      "In Hegel's system, the abstract universality of Being can be understood as the transition from pure thought or the logical 'Idea' to concrete reality or \"Being for another.\" This transition is necessary for God, or pure thought, to truly be what it is. Hegel argues that God could not be appropriately described as God unless there was something concrete contrasting with it. This process of actualizing pure thought into concrete reality is essential for the development of the world and the human mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hegel uses the term 'universal' to describe the object of perception, emphasizing that it has many properties and is not simply limited to sensory certainty. Perception, according to Hegel, incorporates the richness of sensory experience while also moving beyond it. He argues that inferring the existence of God from the finite world is not about positing a separate entity but rather elevating the world to thought. This process involves ascending from 'Being' to 'thought' and recognizing the world as governed by universal laws and as an organic whole. \n",

      "Overall, the abstract universality of Being according to Hegel involves the progression from pure thought to concrete reality, the recognition of universal laws governing the world, and the elevation of the world to thought through the inference of the existence of God.

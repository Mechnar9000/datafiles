       "'708. This simple shape has thus obliterated in itself the unrest of endless singularization—the singularization of the nature-element, which acts necessarily only as universal essence, but in its Being-there and movement acts contingently, as well as the singularization of the people which, dispersed into the particular masses of activity and into individual points of self-consciousness, has a Being-there of mani- fold sense and activity—and condensed it into tranquil individuality. This individu- ality is therefore confronted by the moment of unrest, it—the essence—is confronted by self-consciousness, for which, as the birthplace of that individuality, has nothing left for itself except to be pure activity. What belongs to the substance, the artist imparted entirely to his product, but to himself as a determinate individuality he gave no actuality in his product; he could confer perfection on his product only by discarding his particularity, by disembodying himself and ascending to the abstraction of pure activity.—In this first immediate production, the separation of the work from his self-conscious activity has not yet given way to their reunification; therefore the artefact is not for itself the actually ensouled artefact, it is a whole only together with its becoming. The common factor in the work of art, viz. that it is engendered in consciousness and made by human hands, is the moment of the concept existing as concept, which stands in contrast to the work. And if this concept, as artist or as spectator, is disinterested enough to declare the work of art as in its own self absolutely ensouled, and to forget himself, the agent or viewer, then we must offset this by insisting on the concept of spirit which cannot dispense with the moment of being conscious of itself. But this moment stands in opposition to the artefact because in this initial division of itself the concept gives the two sides their abstract, contrasting determinations of doing and of being-a-thing, and their return into the unity from which they set out has not yet come about.1 '"

In Hegel’s system it corresponds to the transition from Logic to the philosophy of nature, showing how the logical ‘Idea’ necessarily burgeons into a world of space, time, matter, etc. and eventually into the human mind itself. The ‘becoming of Being-there as Being-there’ is associated with (among other things) this process, the transition from logic to nature, while the ‘becoming of the essence’ is presented in the Logic itself, the extraction of the logical essence of the world and the passage to higher and higher logical categories. The becoming of the ‘substance’, i.e. of the logical ‘essence’, passes over into ‘externality’, i.e. nature, where it is ‘for another’, i.e. known to us. The becoming of Being-there is the ‘withdrawal into essence’, perhaps in the sense that nature leads on to mind, the culminating phase of which is philosophy, i.e. logic. \n",

This is the way in which religious representation presents what is in fact a logical necessity, that pure thought or the concept should actualize itself in concrete reality or Being for another. Hegel is attempting to explain why there is anything at all rather than nothing. His argument is that God, or pure thought, could not be what it is, if it did not actualize itself, that God, abstract thought, etc. could not be, or be appropriately described as, God, abstract, etc. unless there were something concrete, etc. contrasting with them. \n",

The world is no longer conceived as, say, an aggregate of contingent entities or as merely orderly. It is a world governed by universal laws and is an organic purposive whole. To infer the existence of God is not, in Hegel’s view, to infer the existence of an entity distinct from the world. It is to ascend from ‘Being’ to ‘thought’ and thus to elevate the world to thought. By contrast, the ‘ontological proof ’ proceeds in the reverse direction, from thought to Being (Enc. I, \n",

Nevertheless, Hegel’s idea is that the essential elements in this progression are the ‘thought-determinations’, Being, nothing, becoming, etc.—or, in PS, the ‘shapes of consciousness’. The other words in the sentences in which they figure are simply the explanatory framework, explaining in particular why each thought- determination moves on into the next. ‘The true is the subject’, not in the sense of ‘subject’ in which it is correlative with a predicate, but in the sense of the subject of activity, as in \n",

The development of the absolute follows the same pattern: the original unity (the subject) splits in two (the subject and concrete reality), and then finds itself again in the world confronting it (human beings). The ‘true’ is not just the first stage of this process; it is the whole process in which God (the beginning) creates a world other than himself and then finds himself (the end) in the world. However, Hegel need not claim that the active subject is also a knowing, purposive subject. Even if the subject is blind energy, it still generates a diversified world different from itself, which eventually provides a sort of duplicate of blind energy—in the form, say, of human beings who experiment with it, write about it, etc.—though we shall be less inclined to say that this ‘equality’ is the ‘goal’ of blind energy.

This transition from the logical 'Idea' to the philosophy of nature demonstrates how the logical essence of the world passes over into nature, where it becomes known to us. God, as pure thought, could not be truly understood as such without the contrast of something concrete. It is through this process of actualization and contrast that the abstract universality of Being is manifested, leading ultimately to the culmination of philosophy, i.e. logic. Hegel's concept of the 'universal' extends to the object of perception and the essential elements in the progression of thought-determinations such as Being, nothing, becoming, etc. This progression leads to the understanding that the true essence of Being is not just the initiator but the entire process itself, culminating in the manifestation of the world as a diversified whole governed by universal laws.\n"

      "Hegel did not explicitly discuss feminism in his works as it was not a prominent social or political movement during his time. However, his philosophy of dialectical idealism, which emphasizes the development of self-consciousness and individual freedom, can be interpreted as laying the groundwork for feminist ideas. In Hegel's view, individuals should strive for self-actualization and self-determination, which are central goals of feminism. Additionally, his concept of recognition and the importance of mutual respect and equality between individuals can be seen as aligning with feminist principles. Nonetheless, Hegel's ideas are complex and open to interpretation, and it is important to consider his writings in their historical context when examining his views on feminism.\n"

       " 'For the sort of statement that might properly be made about philosophy in a preface—say, a historical report of the main direction and standpoint, of the general content and results, a string of desultory assertions and assurances about the true—cannot be accepted as the way and manner in which to expound philosophical truth.',\n",
       " 'Also, philosophy moves essentially in the element2 of universality that embraces the particular within itself, and this creates the impression, more here than in the case of other sciences, that the Thing itself, in all its essentials, is expressed in the aim and the final results, whereas the elaboration is really the inessential.',\n",
       " 'By contrast, we need no convincing that, in the general idea3 of what (for example) anatomy is—say, the knowledge of the parts of the body considered in their lifeless state—we are not yet in possession of the Thing itself, the content of this science, that we must in addition get to grips with the particular.',\n",
       " 'Further, in the case of such an aggregate of information, which has no right to bear the name of science, a conver- sational account of aims and other such generalities is no different from the historical and unconceptual way in which the content itself (these nerves, muscles, etc.',\n",
       " 'In the case of philosophy, by contrast, this would give rise to the incon- gruity that this manner of which philosophy makes use is shown by philosophy itself to be incapable of grasping the truth.',\n",
       " 'So too, determining the relationship that a philosophical work supposes it has with other undertakings on the same subject introduces an extraneous concern, and obscures what really matters in the cognition of the truth.',\n",
       " 'As the opposition between the true and the false becomes firmly fixed for opinion, 1 opinion tends to expect either assent or contradiction in response to a current philosophical system, and to see in any comment on such a system only the one or the other.',\n",
       " 'Opinion does not comprehend the diversity of philosophical systems as the progressive unfolding of the truth; rather it sees in the diversity only contradiction.',\n",

       " 'Yet at the same time their fluid nature makes them moments of the organic unity, in which they not only do not conflict, but each is as necessary as the other; and this shared --- necessity alone constitutes the life of the whole.',\n",
       " 'But the contradiction levelled against a philosophical system does not usually comprehend itself in this way; nor does the apprehending consciousness generally know how to liberate the contradiction from its one-sidedness or keep it free, and to recognize the reciprocally necessary moments in the shape of seeming conflict and contrariety.',\n",
       " 'The demand for such explanations and the satisfaction of it are easily mistaken for a concern with what is essential.',\n",
       " 'Where could a fuller expression of the inner core of a philosophical work be given than in its aims and results, and how could these be more distinctly recognized than by their difference from whatever else the age produces in the same sphere?',\n",
       " 'But when this procedure is taken for more than the beginning of cognition, when it is accepted as actual cognition, then we must in fact count it as one of the devices for bypassing the Thing itself, and combining the semblance of seriousness and of application to the Thing with an actual avoidance of both.',\n",
       " 'For the Thing is not exhausted by its aim, but by its elaboration, nor is the result the actual whole, but only the result together with its becoming.',\n",
       " 'The aim by itself is a lifeless universal, while the tendency is a mere drift that as yet lacks its actuality; and the naked result is a corpse which has left the tendency behind.',\n",
       " 'Similarly, the difference is really the limit of the Thing; it lies where the Thing ceases, or it is what the Thing is not.',\n",
       " 'These exertions over the aim or the results, as well as over the differences and assessments of the one and the other, are therefore an easier task than they perhaps seem to be.',\n",
       " 'For instead of dealing with the Thing, this sort of procedure is always away beyond it; instead of lingering in the Thing and forgetting itself in it, this sort of knowledge is always hankering for something else; it remains preoccupied with itself rather than absorbed in the Thing and surrendering to it.',\n",
       " 'The easiest course is to pass judgement on a work of substance and solidity; to grasp it is harder; hardest of all is to combine the two by producing an account of it.',\n",
       " 'Culture and the emergence from the immediacy of substantial life will always have to begin in the following way.',\n",
       " 'We get acquainted with universal principles and points of view; we work our way up at first only to the thought of the Thing in general; equally we learn to support or refute the Thing with reasons; we learn to apprehend the rich and concrete abundance with determinate precision, and to give an accurate account and a serious judgement of it.',\n",
       " 'But this beginning of culture will first of all make room for the seriousness of life in its fullness, which leads into the experience of the Thing itself.',\n",
       " 'And even if, in addition to all this, the seriousness of the concept descends into the depths of the Thing, this sort of information and assessment will retain its appropriate place in conversation.',\n",
       " 'The true shape in which truth exists can only be the scientific system of truth.',\n",
       " 'To help bring philosophy closer to the form of science—to the goal of its being able to give up the name of love of knowledge and become actual knowledge1—that is what I have set out to do.',\n",
       " 'The inner necessity that knowledge should be science lies in its nature, and the only satisfactory explanation of this is the presentation of philosophy itself.',\n",
       " 'But the external necessity, insofar as it is conceived in a general way, leaving aside contingencies of the person and individual motives, is the same as the inner necessity, in the shape, that is, in which time represents the Being-there of its moments.',\n",
       " 'To show that the time is ripe for the elevation of philosophy to a science—this would therefore be the only true justification of the attempts that --- have this aim, because this would demonstrate the necessity of the aim, because it would indeed at the same time fulfil this very aim.',\n",
       " 'When the true shape of truth is posited in this scientific character—or, what is the same thing, when the truth is asserted to have the element of its existence only in the concept—I am well aware that this seems to stand in contradiction with an idea, and with the consequences of that idea, whose presumption is as great as its prevalence in the convictions of our age.',\n",
       " 'An explanation of this contradiction therefore seems hardly superfluous, even though here it can be no more than an affirmation, just like the view that it opposes.',\n",
       " 'This is the view that the true exists only in what, or rather as what, is variously called intuition, immediate knowledge of the absolute, religion, Being—not in the centre of divine love, but the Being of this centre itself.',\n",
       " 'If this is so, it follows that what is then required for the presentation of philosophy is not the form of the concept, but rather its contrary.',\n",
       " 'The absolute is supposed not to be comprehended, but felt and intuited; it is not the concept of the absolute that is to have its say and find expression, but the feeling and intuition of it.',\n",
       " 'If we look at the appearance of such a demand in its wider context, and consider the stage at which self-conscious spirit stands at present, it is clear that spirit has now advanced beyond the substantial life it formerly led in the element of thought,—beyond this immediacy of its faith, beyond the satisfaction and security of the certainty that consciousness possessed of its reconciliation with the essence and of the universal presence of the essence both within and without.',\n",
       " 'It has not only passed beyond all this into the other extreme of the insubstantial reflection of itself into itself, but beyond that too.',\n",
       " 'Spirit has not only lost its essential life; it is also conscious of this loss, and of the finitude that is its own content.',\n",
       " 'Turning away from the husks, and confessing and cursing its sorry state, it now requires from philoso- phy, not so much knowledge of what it is, as philosophy’s help in establishing once more its substantiality and solidity of Being.',\n",
       " 'Philosophy is supposed to meet this need, not by opening up the locked fastness of substance and raising this to self- consciousness, not by restoring its chaotic consciousness to the order of thought and the simplicity of the concept, but rather by blurring the distinctions of thought, by suppressing the differentiating concept and by establishing the feeling of the essence, providing edification rather than insight.',\n",
       " 'The beautiful, the holy, the eternal, religion, and love are the bait required to arouse the desire to bite; not the concept, but ecstasy, not the cold advance of necessity in the Thing, but the ferment of enthusiasm, these are supposed to be what sustains and promotes the expansion of the wealth of substance.',\n",
       " 'Corresponding to this demand is the strenuous, almost zealous and apparently furious effort to tear men away from their absorption in the sensory, the common- place, the singular,1 and to direct their gaze to the stars; as if they had forgotten all about the divine, and were ready like worms to satisfy themselves with dirt and water.',\n",
       " 'Formerly they had a heaven furnished with a vast wealth of thoughts and images.',\n",
       " 'The meaning of all that is lay in the thread of light by which it was linked to heaven; instead of abiding in this present, our gaze glided along this thread beyond the present, up to the divine essence, to a present beyond, so to speak.',\n",
       " 'The eye of the spirit had to be forcibly directed to earthly things and held there; and it has taken a long time and laborious effort to introduce the clarity that only other-worldly things --- used to have into the fog and confusion enveloping the sense for this world, and to make attention to the present as such, to make what was called experience, interesting and valid.',\n",
       " '—Now we seem to need the opposite: sense seems so firmly rooted in the world that it requires just as much force to raise it up.',\n",
       " 'The spirit is clearly so impoverished that, like a wanderer in the desert longing for a simple drink of water, it seems to crave for its refreshment only the meagre feeling of the divine in general.',\n",
       " 'The extent of spirit’s loss is to be measured by what satisfies it.',\n",
       " 'This modest contentment in receiving, or parsimony in giving, is not, however, right for science.',\n",
       " 'Whoever seeks mere edification, whoever wants to shroud in fog the worldly variety of his Being-there and of thought, in order to get the indeterminate enjoyment of this indeterminate divinity, can look for this where he likes.',\n",
       " 'He will easily find the wherewithal to vent his ardour, and pride himself on it.',\n",
       " 'But philosophy must beware of the wish to be edifying.',\n",
       " 'Still less must this complacency which renounces science make the claim that such hazy enthusiasm is superior to science.',\n",
       " 'This prophetic talk supposes that it remains right in the centre and in the depths, looks disdainfully at determinacy (the Horos), and deliberately keeps away from the concept and necessity, away from the reflection that resides only in finitude.',\n",
       " 'But just as there is an empty breadth, so too there is an empty depth; and just as there is an extension of substance that pours out into finite multiplicity without the power to hold it together, so is this an intensity without content, sheer force without any spread, and this is the same as superficiality.',\n",
       " 'The force of spirit is only as great as its expression, its depth only as deep as it dares to spread out and lose itself in its display.',\n",
       " 'Moreover, when this non-conceptual, substantial knowledge professes to have submerged the ownness of the Self in the essence, and to philosophize in a true and holy manner, it deludes itself: instead of surrendering to God, by spurning measure and determination it merely gives free rein by turns to the contingency of the content within itself and to its own wilfulness.',\n",
       " 'When they give themselves up to the untamed ferment of the substance, they suppose that, by enshrouding self-consciousness and surrendering the understanding they become the beloved of God to whom he gives wisdom in sleep; and so what they in fact conceive and give birth to in their sleep are of course dreams.',\n",
       " 'Incidentally, it is not difficult to see that our time is a time of birth and of transition to a new period.',\n",
       " 'Spirit has broken with the previous world of its life and ideas, and is on the point of submerging it in the past; it is at work on its own transformation.',\n",
       " 'Indeed, spirit is never at rest but always engaged in moving forward.',\n",
       " 'But just as the first breath drawn by a child after its long, quiet nourishment breaks the gradualness of merely quantitative growth,—a qualitative leap,—and now the child is born, so the spirit that cultivates itself matures slowly and quietly into its new shape, dissolving bit by bit the structure of its previous world, whose instability is indicated only by isolated symptoms; the frivolity and boredom that infest the established order, the vague foreboding of something unknown, are heralds of approaching change.',\n",
       " 'This gradual crumbling that did not alter the physiognomy of the whole is interrupted by the sunrise which, like lightning, all of a sudden reveals the contour of the new world.',\n",
       " 'But this new world does not have a complete actuality any more than the new-born child; and it is essential to bear this in mind.',\n",
       " 'The first emergence is only its --- immediacy or its concept.',\n",
       " 'Just as a building is not finished when its foundation has been laid, so the achieved concept of the whole is not the whole itself.',\n",
       " 'When we wish to see an oak in the power of its trunk and in the spread of its branches and the mass of its foliage, we are not satisfied if we are shown an acorn instead.',\n",
       " 'So too, science, the crown of a world of the spirit, is not complete in its beginnings.',\n",
       " 'The beginning of the new spirit is the product of a wide-ranging revolution in various forms of culture, the reward of a complicated, tortuous journey and of an equally immense and strenuous effort.',\n",
       " 'This beginning is the whole that has returned into itself from succession as well as extension, the resultant simple concept of the whole.',\n",
       " 'But the actuality of this simple whole consists in this: these configurations that have become moments again develop anew and take on a configuration, but now in their new element, in the sense that has emerged.',\n",
       " 'The initial appearance of the new world is, on the one hand, only the whole shrouded in its simplicity, or the general foundation of the whole.',\n",
       " 'Yet the wealth of the former Being-there is still present to consciousness in recollection.',\n",
       " 'In the newly appearing shape consciousness misses the range and particularization of content; but even more it misses the articulation of form whereby distinctions are securely determined and ordered in their firm relationships.',\n",
       " 'Without this articulation, science lacks universal intelligibility, and gives the impression of being the esoteric possession of a few singletons;—an esoteric possession, since it is as yet present only in its concept, or only its interior is present; of a few singletons, since its unexpanded appearance makes its Being-there a singular thing.',\n",
       " 'Only what is completely deter- mined is at the same time exoteric, comprehensible, and capable of being learned and becoming the property of everyone.',\n",
       " 'The intelligible form of science is the way to science, open to everyone and equally accessible to everyone, and to attain to rational knowledge through the understanding is the just demand of the consciousness that approaches science; for the understanding is thinking, is the pure I in general; and what is intelligible is what is already familiar and common to science and the unscientific consciousness alike, enabling the unscientific consciousness to enter science immediately.',\n",
       " 'When it first begins and has thus achieved neither completeness of detail nor perfection of form, science is open to criticism for this.',\n",
       " 'But it would be unjust, if such criticism is supposed to affect the essence of science, and it is equally inadmissible to refuse to recognize the demand for such articulation.',\n",
       " 'This opposition seems to be the most important knot with which scientific culture is at present grappling, and which it still does not properly understand.',\n",
       " 'One side insists on its wealth of material and its intelligibility, the other side scorns this intelligibility at least, and insists on its immediate rationality and divinity.',\n",
       " 'Even if the former side is reduced to silence, whether by the force of truth alone or by the browbeating of the other, and even if it feels overwhelmed with regard to the fundamentals of the Thing, still it is by no means satisfied regarding the demands it makes: the demands are just, but not fulfilled.',\n",
       " 'Its silence is only half due to the victory, but half to the boredom and indifference that are apt to be the consequence of a constantly aroused expectation and of promises not attended by fulfilment.',\n",
       " 'As for the content, sometimes the others certainly make it easy for themselves to have a wide range.',\n",
       " 'They draw into their domain a mass of material, namely --- material that is already familiar and well ordered, and by focusing chiefly on oddities and curiosities they seem all the more to have in their possession everything else that knowledge has already dealt with in its way, and also to be in control of what is still in disarray.',\n",
       " 'And so they seem to subject everything to the absolute Idea, which thus seems to be cognized in everything and to have matured into an expanded science.',\n",
       " 'But a closer inspection shows that this expansion has not come about through one and the same principle’s spontaneous adoption of different shapes, but it is rather the shapeless repetition of one and the same principle, which is just externally applied to the different material, and acquires a tedious semblance of diversity.',\n",
       " 'The Idea, which for itself is no doubt true, in fact always remains at its starting-point, if the develop- ment consists in nothing more than such a repetition of the same formula.',\n",
       " 'When the knowing subject parades this single immobile form around in whatever is at hand, when the material is dipped into this stagnant element from outside, this does not fulfil what is needed any better than arbitrary notions about the content.',\n",
       " 'It is not, that is, the wealth of shapes surging up from itself and their self-determining differenti- ation.',\n",
       " 'Rather it is a monochromatic formalism that only arrives at the differentiation of the material because the material is already prepared and familiar.',\n",
       " 'Yet this formalism presents this monotony and abstract universality as the absolute; it assures us that dissatisfaction with it is an incapacity to master the absolute standpoint and stick to it.',\n",
       " 'Formerly, the empty possibility of representing something in another way was sufficient to refute an idea, and this bare possibility, the universal thought, also had the entire positive value of actual cognition.',\n",
       " 'Here too we see all value ascribed to the universal Idea in this form of non-actuality, and the dissolution of the distinct and determinate—or rather their banishment into the abyss of emptiness with no further development or intrinsic justification—presented as the speculative approach.',\n",

       " 'It is a natural idea that in philosophy, before we come to deal with the Thing itself, namely with the actual cognition of what in truth is, it is necessary first to come to an understanding about cognition, which is regarded as the instrument by which we take possession of the absolute, or as the medium through which we catch sight of it.',\n",
       " 'The concern seems justified, on the one hand that there may be various kinds of cognition, and one of them might be handier than another for the attainment of this goal, and so by a wrong choice among them,1—and on the other hand that, since cognition is a capacity of a determinate kind and scope, without a more precise determination of its nature and limits, we shall get hold of clouds of error instead of the heaven of truth.',\n",
       " 'What is more, this concern must surely turn into the conviction that the whole enterprise of securing for consciousness that which is in itself through cognition is absurd in its concept, and that between cognition and the absolute there lies a boundary that completely divides them.',\n",
       " 'For, if cognition is the instrument for gaining possession of the absolute essence, it is immediately obvious that the appli- cation of an instrument to a Thing does not in fact leave it as it is for itself, but rather effects a forming and alteration of it.',\n",
       " 'Or if cognition is not an instrument of our activity but a sort of passive medium through which the light of truth reaches us, then again we do not receive the truth as it is in itself, but only as it is through and in this medium.',\n",

       " 'Or if an examination of cognition, which we represent as a medium, acquaints us with the law of its refraction, it is again useless to subtract the refraction from the result; for cognition is not the refraction of the ray, but the ray itself by which truth reaches us, and if this were subtracted, only the pure direction or blank space would have been indicated to us.',\n",

       " 'This presents itself here like this: since what first appeared as the object sinks to consciousness’s knowledge of it, and the in-itself becomes a Being-for-consciousness of the in-itself, this is the new object, bringing on a new shape of consciousness too, for which the essence is something different from that of the preceding shape.',\n",

      "It is never sublated, and it has been at work all along in various guises, seeking to actualize itself, as the title of PS indicates.. The isolation and analyses of the previous shapes were conducted by spirit, focusing on particular aspects of itself in order to discover and develop its true nature.. These aspects are only abstractions from spirit, whereas spirit itself is ‘existence’, a word that has the flavour of ‘stepping-forth’, in accordance with its Latin etymology.. This may be why (as Hyppolite, II, p.16, n.6 suggests) the dialectical development of spirit corresponds to a coherent temporal and historical development, which is, in the preceding shapes, dimly discernible in the development of self-consciousness, but not elsewhere.. Moreover, while each of the previous shapes left its predecessors behind, spirit incorporates these shapes as aspects of itself.. It is an objective being, as the objects of consciousness are.. It is Being-for-itself, as self-consciousness is.. It is the unity of both, an object which reason determines in accordance with the category.\n",

The words occur frequently in the Preface, but rarely in the rest of PS, since they are associated primarily with Hegel’s logic.. The Latin verb also gave rise to speculum, ‘mirror’, and Hegel’s usage is often said to involve mirroring: see e.g. Enc.. But speculum is only a minor member of the specul-family, and there is no trace in Hegel of a link between ‘speculation’ and mirrors.. I,  112 Addition associates mirrors with ‘reflection’ rather than speculation.. III, Hegel explicitly distinguishes three stages of spirit: ‘subjective spirit’ (roughly, the individual mind), ‘objective spirit’ (the collective social life of a people), and ‘absolute spirit’ (art, religion, and philosophy).. He does not draw this distinction explicitly in PS, and tends to call the individual mind the ‘soul’ (Seele) rather than the ‘spirit’: see  77.. Geist’s wide range of senses (including the ‘holy spirit’) and its tendency develop from one to the other, as well as its tendency to embrace what is other than Geist, make it an especially suitable candidate for the status of the absolute.\n",

This is similar to what happened in chapter II, when the sensory This passed into the thing of perception, not the universal of the understanding: humans are regarded as distinct perceptible things, not as participants in a shared rationality.. The passage of Christ into the past (like the Now in  106) transforms the believer into spiritual consciousness.. Christ is now resurrected in the spirit.. The sensory presence of Christ, distinct from other Selves, was as much a hindrance as a help: cf.. the unhappy consciousness in  212.. Now that he has gone, spirit becomes the universal self- consciousness of the community of believers.. What matters is not Christ alone, but what he is for this community.\n",

      "So perhaps (i) means ‘The true (i.e. the absolute, since ‘true’ here is also used in its objective sense) is only actual (i.e. complete) when it develops into a system (i.e.an organized structure)’.. Then the connection with proposition (ii) is this: if the absolute is only substance, it cannot develop into a system; it can only do so if it is also an active, purposive subject.. However, Hegel may instead, or even also, be continuing his subjective use of ‘system’, which also makes decent sense of (ii): ‘The true or absolute is only completely actualized when it is presented in a system by us, for only then does it fully recover itself in its creation.. ’ This suggests that the ‘subject’ in (ii) is not only an active subject, but also a knowing, system-building subject.. This eases the introduction of spirit.. Here Hegel speaks of ‘the spiritual’ (das Geistige) as well as of ‘spirit’ (Geist), perhaps because he is discussing the emergence and development of spirit, which begins not from fully fledged spirit, but the spiritual aspect of ordinary life.. This is initially embedded in substance, rather than free and independent (‘in-and-for-itself ’): it is ‘spiritual substance’ (geistige Substanz), an expression that recurs in PS   26 and 36 as well as in chapter VI.. That ‘the spiritual alone is the actual’ means that only the spiritual has the power to undertake the following process: (1) It is the ‘essence’ or ‘in itself ’, it has an intrinsic nature that does not depend on its relationships to other things or, more specifically, on its being revealed to itself or to others.\n",

But this is just a representation, an artificial mixture of sensory immediacy and thought.. The content of this representation is true, but the representational form is defective..

Objectivity is ‘negative’ to knowledge, in that while neither can occur without the other, they are distinct from each other, as are, say, the poles of a magnet or wife and husband: see also  37.. The moments that spirit ‘unfolds’ are not the same as the moments of consciousness, viz.. knowledge and objectivity.. They are rather the stages of spirit’s development, while knowledge and objectivity are the ‘opposition’ that inheres in each stage.. Hegel’s argument is: spirit unfolds its spirit-moments in consciousness, so the opposition involved in consciousness-moments inheres in every spirit-moment and every spirit-moment becomes a ‘shape’ or form of consciousness..

So it tends be an overseer as well.. Hegel gives no hint here that Stoicism too is also a divided consciousness; its self- consciousness is ‘simple freedom’.. Scepticism realizes this freedom by annihilating the ‘Being-there’ that threatens it, not simply retreating from it.. It is this that leads to its duplication of self-consciousness.. Duplication is a recurrent theme in PS: e.g.  486 on the duplication into the world of ‘actuality’ and the world of the ‘aether of pure consciousness’.. Especially memorable is the description of ‘faith’ in  572: ‘The faithful consciousness weighs and measures by a twofold standard, it has two sorts of eyes, two sorts of ears, two sorts of tongue and language, etc..

Hegel provides no clear criterion for deciding where necessity ends and contingency begins, nor is it always clear where he locates the boundary between them.. There also remains the question whether the ‘movement’ is only logical (as in logic itself and—on Hegel’s view— in nature) or also temporal (as in history).. Hegel clearly regards the order in which the terms occur as logical, both in his Logic and in PS, and this logical order is mirrored in a corresponding temporal sequence in the minds of Hegel and his readers.. But to what extent --- does Hegel regard the logical order as mirrored in the historical development of humanity?. He makes some attempt to correlate early stages of his Logic with stages in the history of philosophy, the concept of pure Being corresponding to Parmenides and that of becoming to Heraclitus, but thereafter his attempt to correlate the two orders becomes piecemeal and arbitrary.. On the face of it, much of PS is not correlated with history, and those parts of it that are fall into three distinct historical sequences: from early Greece and/or the state of nature down to medieval Christianity (Self-consciousness: the struggle for recognition- Stoicism–Scepticism–the Unhappy Consciousness), from the Greek city-state to the French revolution and Kantian morality (Spirit), and from ancient Persia or thereabouts down to the Reformation (Religion).. Critics of Hegel, such as Adolf Trendelenberg (1802–1872) and Hermann Lotze (1816–1881), have long argued that Hegel’s belief that concepts are embedded in extra-logical things and determine their structure as well as, in some cases, their development over time, is fallacious.\n",

That this overall system in biological organisms is regarded by Hegel as deriving from a concept owes much to Kant’s Critique of Judgement..

This explains the aversion to prefaces expressed in   1f.. , along with a comparison with anatomy..

      "So did the chorus in tragedies.. For Hegel, the removal of the mask symbolizes the unhypocritical plain speaking of comedy about the gods and everything else.. The comic Self has the gods in its power.. It is elevated above them as if they were each just a property or attribute of a thing, pretending to be something in its own right.. It plays with its mask to show that it is a Self, just like the actor and the spectator.. There is some similarity to the resolution of the division between enlightenment and superstition, when heaven is transplanted to earth and the Self breaks free: see  581.. The old gods took care of the natural and the ethical well-being of man.. But now the divine order has broken down and man takes his fate into his own hands, with unhappy results.\n",

      ", but whereas Socrates’s wisdom and justice are distinct from Socrates himself, God’s wisdom and justice are identical with God.. Yovel (2005, p.103) plausibly suggests that Hegel effected ‘a becoming-other that must be taken back’ in yet another way, retracting the initial predication by further predications.. The subject ‘becomes other’ when a predicate is ascribed to it: e.g. if we say ‘Man is an animal’, man becomes other than himself, namely an animal.. But if we add a further predicate, ‘rational’, we restore man to his original status, only on a higher, more explicit plane: ‘Man is a rational animal’.. The absolute is more complex, but the principle is the same.. We start by saying, e.g. ‘The absolute is pure Being’, which makes it other than itself, and eventually (by the end of Hegel’s Logic, at least by the end of his system) we arrive at a way of speaking about the absolute that is adequate to it and restores it to its initial grandeur.. Hegel’s Logic can be seen initially as a series of predications of the absolute or God.. Here Hegel agrees with Aquinas and disagrees with Plotinus.\n",

The religion of art belongs to the ethical spirit which we earlier saw perish in the state of right, i.e. in the proposition: the Self as such, the abstract person, is absolute essence.. In the ethical life, the Self is submerged in the spirit of its people, it is universality filled.. But simple singularity arises out of this content, and its levity refines it into a person, into the abstract universality of right.. In this universality the reality of the ethical spirit is lost and, empty of content, the spirits of the national individuals are gathered into a single pantheon, not a pantheon of representation whose powerless form lets each spirit go its own way, but the pantheon of abstract universality, of pure thought, which disembodies them and assigns Being in- and for- itself to the spiritless Self, to the singular person.. But this Self has, through its emptiness, let the content go free; consciousness is the essence only within itself; its own Being-there, the juridical recognition of the person, is the unfilled abstraction; it possesses, therefore, rather only the thought of itself; or as it is there and knows itself as object, it is the consciousness that is not actual.. Hence it is only the stoical independence of thinking, and this, passing through the movement of the sceptical consciousness, finds its truth in that shape which was called the unhappy self-consciousness.. This self-consciousness knows all about the actual validity of the abstract person and all about its validity in pure thought.\n",

The simple models that Hegel has presented earlier have a similar structure.. In PS  2 successive philosophies are related to each other like the stages in the growth of a plant, each ‘refuted’ by its successor.. In   18 and 19, God first becomes other than himself, in a way refuting himself, and then recovers himself in the world.. Here Hegel is primarily referring to the treatment of abstract concepts in his logic.. But his procedure in the body of PS follows the same pattern.. Each shape of consciousness (including the opening one, sensory certainty) is supplanted by its successor; it does not persist unmodified in the way that a traditional axiom, premise, or theorem does.\n",

      "The abstract universality of Being according to Hegel revolves around the concept of self-consciousness and the development of consciousness throughout different stages. Hegel argues that the knowing 'I' is essential and active, acknowledging the role of the self in perceiving the world. The use of 'I' as a reference point is universal and applicable to all individuals, unlike other indexicals such as 'this', 'here', and 'now'. When the word 'I' is used, the referent is clear as it points directly to the individual using it.\n",

      "Hegel's understanding of perception highlights the importance of the object having an intrinsic universal aspect, beyond being just a particular 'this'. Perceiving, for Hegel, involves taking something truly as it is, emphasizing the connection between the object and the perceiver. He also delves into the role of language in shaping our perceptions and understanding of the world.\n",

      "Furthermore, Hegel's exploration of logical necessity and contingency delves into the intricate relationship between necessity and contingency in both logical and temporal contexts. He questions the extent to which the logical order mirrors historical development and the correlation between his logical concepts and the evolution of human history and philosophy.\n",

      "In terms of self-consciousness and the development of consciousness, Hegel discusses the evolution of the individual's understanding of themselves and their place in the world. From the ethical spirit to the abstract universality of right, Hegel traces the progression of self-consciousness through various stages, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding of the self and its connection to the universal.\n",

      "In summary, Hegel's exploration of the abstract universality of Being delves into the complexities of self-consciousness, perception, language, logical necessity, and historical development.

By contrast, while the second estrangement also expresses self-consciousness’s implicit identity with its opposite, the universal essence, self-consciousness is aware of the transition and conducts it itself.. Christ had an actual mother, but only the in-itself for a father.. This symbolizes the union of self-consciousness and the substance.. Spirit involves two estrangements, that of the essence into self-consciousness and that of self-consciousness into the essence.. Some religions of the Roman Empire (such as neo- Platonism and the mystery religions of Isis and Mithras) acknowledged only the second of these, the Self ’s self-estrangement into substance, thereby regarding the whole world as imbued with spirit.. But without the first estrangement, the genuine transition of the essence into self-consciousness, this is just an imaginative projection..

So too, determining the relationship that a philosophical work supposes it has with other undertakings on the same subject introduces an extraneous concern, and obscures what really matters in the cognition of the truth.. As the opposition between the true and the false becomes firmly fixed for opinion, 1 opinion tends to expect either assent or contradiction in response to a current philosophical system, and to see in any comment on such a system only the one or the other.. Opinion does not comprehend the diversity of philosophical systems as the progressive unfolding of the truth; rather it sees in the diversity only contradiction..

Yet at the same time their fluid nature makes them moments of the organic unity, in which they not only do not conflict, but each is as necessary as the other; and this shared --- necessity alone constitutes the life of the whole.. But the contradiction levelled against a philosophical system does not usually comprehend itself in this way; nor does the apprehending consciousness generally know how to liberate the contradiction from its one-sidedness or keep it free, and to recognize the reciprocally necessary moments in the shape of seeming conflict and contrariety.\n",

Thus each of the pair, in playing with the other, is in a way playing with him- or herself.. Because of this identity in difference, love is an appropriate metaphor for God’s relationship both with other members of the Trinity and with the world he creates.. In Hegel (1895) III, pp.. 11 and 35, Hegel applies the metaphor to the eternal (or atemporal) triplicity within God, while PS  19 applies it to God’s creation, and subsequent redemption, of the world, which, in contrast to God’s inner triune life, requires ‘alienation’ (Entfremdung) of himself, and then the labour of redis- covering himself in the world.. However, God as the ‘essence’, i.e. the atemporal triune God, involves the ‘form’ in which the essence is to develop, and so also involves temporal creation and redemption, whereby the ‘in-itself ’, God as merely potential, becomes ‘for itself ’, fully actual, and also self-aware.\n",

Immediate Being-there is accommodated by acknowledging the importance of conscience.. Determinate Being-there, which in  791 was represented as utility, is now accommodated as the oppositional relationship between the singular Self ’s dutiful action and the universal ethical order.. This opposition is reconciled in the act of forgiveness, whereby the conscientious Self is reintegrated into the universal order, and the singular Self becomes identical with the universal Self: see  671 and note.. The upshot is a society that gives their due both to the moral conscience and to the ethical order.. This amounts to a reconciliation of self-consciousness, the singular Self, with consciousness, the universal Self, that we also find in Christianity..

In the science of Hegel’s time, they are regarded as ‘matters’, such as heat-matter, electrical-matter, etc.. , that occupy pores in the thing: see Enc..

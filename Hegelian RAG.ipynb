This spirit is not only the universal substance of all singletons; since this substance has for actual consciousness the shape of consciousness, this means, in addition, that this substance, which has individualization, is known by the singletons as their own essence and product. So for them it is not the light-essence in whose unity the Being- for-self of self-consciousness is contained only negatively, only in a transitory way, and beholds the master of its actuality,—nor is it the consuming and relentless hatred of hostile peoples,—nor their subjugation to castes which together constitute the semblance of organization of a completed whole, but a whole that lacks the universal freedom of the individuals. No, this spirit is the free people in which custom constitutes the substance of all, whose actuality and Being-there each and everyone knows as their own will and deed.1 '"

Hegel summarizes the whole development of spirit. It begins with the tightly knit ethical life of the Greek city-state. This is rent apart by its self-knowledge, leading to the abstract ‘right’ of the Roman Empire, which sets the Self in opposition to the substance. Division persists in the history of Europe down to the French revolution: there are two realms, that of culture (the hither side) and that of faith (the beyond). These realms are --- shattered by the ‘insight’ of the enlightenment, the conceptual penetration of an object that results in its dissolution. The two realms thus coalesce into morality, where the Self is all- important, culminating in conscience. . 463. 1. Hegel finds a twofold syllogistic structure in the ethical realm. One syllogism is the movement from the extreme of conscious spirit, by way of the middle term, man, to the other extreme, unconscious spirit (or death). The other is the movement from unconscious spirit, by way of the middle term woman, into the conscious realm. The man–woman relationship is the middle term linking these two syllogisms, i.e. linking divine law and human law. The exact form taken by this joint syllogism is unclear, mainly because it is unclear whether the emergence of divine law into daylight consists simply in the woman burying the man or in her performing (as Antigone does) a combative part in the public realm. b. The ethical action. Human and divine knowledge. Guilt and destiny. . 71. 1. In his dialogues Plato often illustrated the philosophical arguments (logos) of his interlocutors with a myth (muthos), often, though not invariably, a myth about the fate of the soul after death. Because these myths are pictorial and go beyond anything that could be established by rational argument, Hegel regards them as ‘scientifically worthless’. However, they were valued by Neoplatonists such as Proclus, who produced elaborate allegorical accounts of some of Plato’s myths. Hegel may also have had in mind such romantics as Friedrich Schlegel, who hoped for the creation of a ‘new mythology’ as a remedy for Germany’s cultural ills and said that ‘Plato’s philosophy is a dignified preface to future religion’. In an age when myths are preferred to conceptual thought, Hegel’s work is unlikely to appeal to many readers. However, there have been other ages when conceptual thought, as it is found in Aristotle and in Plato’s Parmenides (a dialogue of immense difficulty but lacking in myth) were appreciated, especially by Proclus (412–485 ), who wrote a commentary on the Parmenides, as well as on others of Plato’s works. Proclus might well be accused of ‘enthusiasm’ (Schwärmerei), given his interest in the theology of the Orphic and Chaldaean oracles and his practice of theurgy. Hegel is hard put to it to distinguish the ‘enthusiasm’ and ‘ecstasy’ he condemns in . 675. This belief in the nothing of necessity and in the underworld becomes belief in heaven, because the departed Self must unite with its universality, display what it contains within this universality, and so become clear to itself. But we saw this realm of faith unfold its content only in the element of thinking without the concept, and consequently perish in its fate, namely, in the religion of enlightenment. In this religion, the supersensible beyond of the understanding is restored, but in such a way that self- consciousness remains satisfied in this world and knows the supersensible beyond—the empty, impenetrable and innocuous beyond—neither as Self nor as power.1 --- . . : ‘Note Hegel’s incorporation of Evil into the Absolute’. Whatever else Hegel may have believed about the absolute, he did not believe that it was purely good to the exclusion of evil. Evil, and falsity, must be taken on board. . 502. 1. Hegel intertwines logic with practical reality. These conflicting judgements are brought together by us philosophers, and seen to be suspect, but not by consciousness itself. From the logical point of view, they require deduction by a syllogism, so that consciousness itself can see which, if any of them, is correct. From the point of view of reality, the essences themselves are so far treated only as objects of judgement, as passive ‘predicates’. We have not seen how they manage their own development, as active ‘subjects’. This is why consciousness remains split into two one-sided judgers, surveying the essences from outside. The syllogism will remedy this. It will amount to an actual linkage between the judgers and the essences, putting the judgements into practical effect and showing how the noble consciousness cultivates itself and thereby generates the spiritual power of the State. This corresponds to the transition from feudalism to absolute monarchy: see PH, pp.398ff. \n",

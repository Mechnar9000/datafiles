        Preface

¶1. It is customary to begin a work by explaining in a preface the aim that the author
set himself in the work, his reasons for writing it, and the relationship in which he
believes it to stand to other earlier or contemporary treatments of the same subject.
In the case of a philosophical work, however, such an explanation seems not only
superfluous but, in view of the nature of the Thing,1                          even inappropriate and
misleading. For the sort of statement that might properly be made about philosophy
in a preface—say, a historical            report   of the main direction and standpoint, of the
general content and results, a string of desultory assertions and assurances about the
true—cannot be accepted as the way and manner in which to expound philosophical
truth. Also, philosophy moves essentially in the element2                            of universality that
embraces the particular within itself, and this creates the impression, more here
than in the case of other sciences, that the Thing itself, in all its essentials, is expressed
in the aim and the final results, whereas the elaboration is really the inessential. By
contrast, we need no convincing that, in the general idea3                       of what (for example)
anatomy is—say, the knowledge of the parts of the body considered in their lifeless
state—we are not yet in possession of the Thing itself, the content of this science, that
we must in addition get to grips with the particular. Further, in the case of such an
aggregate of information, which has no right to bear the name of science, a conver-
sational account of aims and other such generalities is no different from the historical
and unconceptual way in which the content itself (these nerves, muscles, etc.) is
discussed. In the case of philosophy, by contrast, this would give rise to the incon-
gruity that this manner of which philosophy makes use is shown by philosophy itself
to be incapable of grasping the truth.4
    ¶2. So too, determining the relationship that a philosophical work supposes it has
with other undertakings on the same subject introduces an extraneous concern, and
obscures what really matters in the cognition of the truth. As the opposition between
the true and the false becomes firmly                fixed for opinion, 1 opinion tends to expect
either assent or contradiction in response to a current philosophical system, and to
see in any comment on such a system only the one or the other. Opinion does not
comprehend the diversity of philosophical systems as the progressive unfolding of
the truth; rather it sees in the diversity only contradiction. The bud disappears when
the blossom bursts forth, and one could say that the bud is refuted by the blossom;
similarly, when the fruit appears, the blossom is declared to be a false Being-there2 of
the plant, and the fruit replaces the blossom as the truth of the plant. These forms are
not only different, they also supplant one another as mutually incompatible. Yet at
the same time their fluid nature makes them moments of the organic unity, in which
they not only do not conflict, but each is as necessary as the other; and this shared
---
    

necessity alone constitutes the life of the whole. But the contradiction levelled against
a philosophical system does not usually comprehend itself in this way; nor does the
apprehending consciousness generally know how to liberate the contradiction from
its one-sidedness or keep it free, and to recognize the reciprocally necessary moments
in the shape of seeming conflict and contrariety. 3
    ¶3. The demand for such explanations and the satisfaction of it are easily mistaken
for a concern with what is essential. Where could a fuller expression of the inner core
of a philosophical work be given than in its aims and results, and how could these be
more distinctly recognized than by their difference from whatever else the age
produces in the same sphere? But when this procedure is taken for more than the
beginning of cognition, when it is accepted as actual cognition, then we must in fact
count it as one of the devices for bypassing the Thing itself, and combining the
semblance of seriousness and of application to the Thing with an actual avoidance of
both. For the Thing is not exhausted by its aim, but by its elaboration, nor is the result
the actual whole, but only the result together with its becoming. The aim by itself is a
lifeless universal, while the tendency is a mere drift that as yet lacks its actuality; and
the naked result is a corpse which has left the tendency behind. Similarly, the
difference     is really the    limit   of the Thing; it lies where the Thing ceases, or it is
what the Thing is not. These exertions over the aim or the results, as well as over the
differences and assessments of the one and the other, are therefore an easier task than
they perhaps seem to be. For instead of dealing with the Thing, this sort of procedure
is always away beyond it; instead of lingering in the Thing and forgetting itself in it,
this sort of knowledge is always hankering for something else; it remains preoccupied
with itself rather than absorbed in the Thing and surrendering to it. The easiest
course is to pass judgement on a work of substance and solidity; to grasp it is harder;
hardest of all is to combine the two by producing an account of it.1
    ¶4. Culture and the emergence from the immediacy of substantial life will always
have to begin in the following way. We get acquainted with universal principles and
points of view; we work our way up at first only to the thought of the Thing in general;
equally we learn to support or refute the Thing with reasons; we learn to apprehend
the rich and concrete abundance with determinate precision, and to give an accurate
account and a serious judgement of it. But this beginning of culture will first of all
make room for the seriousness of life in its fullness, which leads into the experience of
the Thing itself. And even if, in addition to all this, the seriousness of the concept
descends into the depths of the Thing, this sort of information and assessment will
retain its appropriate place in conversation.1
    ¶5. The true shape in which truth exists can only be the scientific system of truth.
To help bring philosophy closer to the form of science—to the goal of its being able to
give up the name of love of knowledge and become actual knowledge1—that is what
I have set out to do. The inner necessity that knowledge should be science lies in its
nature, and the only satisfactory explanation of this is the presentation of philosophy
itself. But the external       necessity, insofar as it is conceived in a general way, leaving
aside contingencies of the person and individual motives, is the same as the                    inner
necessity, in the shape, that is, in which time represents the Being-there of its
moments. To show that the time is ripe for the elevation of philosophy to a
science—this would therefore be the only true justification of the attempts that
---
                                                                                                

have this aim, because this would demonstrate the necessity of the aim, because it
would indeed at the same time fulfil this very aim. 2
    ¶6. When the true shape of truth is posited in this scientific character—or, what is
the same thing, when the truth is asserted to have the element of its existence only in
the concept—I am well aware that this seems to stand in contradiction with an idea,
and with the consequences of that idea, whose presumption is as great as its
prevalence in the convictions of our age. An explanation of this contradiction
therefore seems hardly superfluous, even though here it can be no more than an
affirmation, just like the view that it opposes. This is the view that the true exists only
in what, or rather as what, is variously called intuition, immediate knowledge of the
absolute, religion, Being—not in the centre of divine love, but the Being of this centre
itself. If this is so, it follows that what is then required for the presentation of
philosophy is not the form of the concept, but rather its contrary. The absolute is
supposed not to be comprehended, but felt and intuited; it is not the concept of the
absolute that is to have its say and find expression, but the feeling and intuition of it. 1
    ¶7. If we look at the appearance of such a demand in its wider context, and
consider the stage at which self-conscious spirit stands at present, it is clear that spirit
has now advanced beyond the substantial life it formerly led in the element of
thought,—beyond this immediacy of its faith, beyond the satisfaction and security
of the certainty that consciousness possessed of its reconciliation with the essence
and of the universal presence of the essence both within and without. It has not only
passed beyond all this into the other extreme of the insubstantial reflection of itself
into itself, but beyond that too. Spirit has not only lost its essential life; it is also
conscious of this loss, and of the finitude that is its own content. Turning away from
the husks, and confessing and cursing its sorry state, it now requires from philoso-
phy, not so much knowledge of what it is, as philosophy’s help in establishing once
more its substantiality and solidity of Being. Philosophy is supposed to meet this
need, not by opening up the locked fastness of substance and raising this to self-
consciousness, not by restoring its chaotic consciousness to the order of thought and
the simplicity of the concept, but rather by blurring the distinctions of thought, by
suppressing the differentiating concept and by establishing the feeling of the essence,
providing edification rather than insight. The beautiful, the holy, the eternal, religion,
and love are the bait required to arouse the desire to bite; not the concept, but ecstasy,
not the cold advance of necessity in the Thing, but the ferment of enthusiasm, these
are supposed to be what sustains and promotes the expansion of the wealth of
substance.1
    ¶8. Corresponding to this demand is the strenuous, almost zealous and apparently
furious effort to tear men away from their absorption in the sensory, the common-
place, the singular,1 and to direct their gaze to the stars; as if they had forgotten all
about the divine, and were ready like worms to satisfy themselves with dirt and water.
Formerly they had a heaven furnished with a vast wealth of thoughts and images. The
meaning of all that is lay in the thread of light by which it was linked to heaven;
instead of abiding in          this  present, our gaze glided along this thread beyond the
present, up to the divine essence, to a present beyond, so to speak. The eye of the
spirit had to be forcibly directed to earthly things and held there; and it has taken a
long time and laborious effort to introduce the clarity that only other-worldly things
---
    

used to have into the fog and confusion enveloping the sense for this world, and to
make attention to the present as such, to make what was called experience, interesting
and valid.—Now we seem to need the opposite: sense seems so firmly rooted in the
world that it requires just as much force to raise it up. The spirit is clearly so
impoverished that, like a wanderer in the desert longing for a simple drink of
water, it seems to crave for its refreshment only the meagre feeling of the divine in
general. The extent of spirit’s loss is to be measured by what satisfies it. 2
    ¶9. This modest contentment in receiving, or parsimony in giving, is not, however,
right for science. Whoever seeks mere edification, whoever wants to shroud in fog the
worldly variety of his Being-there and of thought, in order to get the indeterminate
enjoyment of this indeterminate divinity, can look for this where he likes. He will
easily find the wherewithal to vent his ardour, and pride himself on it. But philosophy
must beware of the wish to be edifying.
    ¶10. Still less must this complacency which renounces science make the claim that
such hazy enthusiasm is superior to science. This prophetic talk supposes that it
remains right in the centre and in the depths, looks disdainfully at determinacy (the
Horos), and deliberately keeps away from the concept and necessity, away from the
reflection that resides only in finitude. But just as there is an empty breadth, so too
there is an empty depth; and just as there is an extension of substance that pours out
into finite multiplicity without the power to hold it together, so is this an intensity
without content, sheer force without any spread, and this is the same as superficiality.
The force of spirit is only as great as its expression, its depth only as deep as it dares to
spread out and lose itself in its display. Moreover, when this non-conceptual,
substantial knowledge professes to have submerged the ownness of the Self in the
essence, and to philosophize in a true and holy manner, it deludes itself: instead of
surrendering to God, by spurning measure and determination it merely gives free
rein by turns to the contingency of the content within itself and to its own wilfulness.
When they give themselves up to the untamed ferment of the substance, they suppose
that, by enshrouding self-consciousness and surrendering the understanding they
become the beloved of God to whom he gives wisdom in sleep; and so what they in
fact conceive and give birth to in their sleep are of course dreams.1
    ¶11. Incidentally, it is not difficult to see that our time is a time of birth and of
transition to a new period. Spirit has broken with the previous world of its life and
ideas, and is on the point of submerging it in the past; it is at work on its own
transformation. Indeed, spirit is never at rest but always engaged in moving forward.
But just as the first breath drawn by a child after its long, quiet nourishment breaks
the gradualness of merely quantitative growth,—a qualitative leap,—and now the
child is born, so the spirit that cultivates itself matures slowly and quietly into its new
shape, dissolving bit by bit the structure of its previous world, whose instability is
indicated only by isolated symptoms; the frivolity and boredom that infest the
established order, the vague foreboding of something unknown, are heralds of
approaching change. This gradual crumbling that did not alter the physiognomy of
the whole is interrupted by the sunrise which, like lightning, all of a sudden reveals
the contour of the new world.1
    ¶12. But this new world does not have a complete actuality any more than the
new-born child; and it is essential to bear this in mind. The first emergence is only its
---
                                                                                                   

immediacy or its concept. Just as a building is not finished when its foundation has
been laid, so the achieved concept of the whole is not the whole itself. When we wish
to see an oak in the power of its trunk and in the spread of its branches and the mass
of its foliage, we are not satisfied if we are shown an acorn instead. So too, science, the
crown of a world of the spirit, is not complete in its beginnings. The beginning of
the new spirit is the product of a wide-ranging revolution in various forms of culture,
the reward of a complicated, tortuous journey and of an equally immense and
strenuous effort. This beginning is the whole that has returned into itself from
succession as well as extension, the resultant simple concept                      of the whole. But the
actuality of this simple whole consists in this: these configurations that have become
moments again develop anew and take on a configuration, but now in their new
element, in the sense that has emerged.1
    ¶13. The initial appearance of the new world is, on the one hand, only the whole
shrouded in its simplicity, or the general foundation of the whole. Yet the wealth of
the former Being-there is still present to consciousness in recollection. In the newly
appearing shape consciousness misses the range and particularization of content; but
even more it misses the articulation of form whereby distinctions are securely
determined and ordered in their firm relationships. Without this articulation, science
lacks universal intelligibility, and gives the impression of being the esoteric possession
of a few singletons;—an esoteric possession, since it is as yet present only in its
concept, or only its interior is present; of a few singletons, since its unexpanded
appearance makes its Being-there a singular thing. Only what is completely deter-
mined is at the same time exoteric, comprehensible, and capable of being learned and
becoming the property of everyone. The intelligible form of science is the way to
science, open to everyone and equally accessible to everyone, and to attain to rational
knowledge through the understanding is the just demand of the consciousness that
approaches science; for the understanding is thinking, is the pure I in general; and
what is intelligible is what is already familiar and common to science and the
unscientific consciousness alike, enabling the unscientific consciousness to enter
science immediately.1
    ¶14. When it first begins and has thus achieved neither completeness of detail nor
perfection of form, science is open to criticism for this. But it would be unjust, if such
criticism is supposed to affect the essence of science, and it is equally inadmissible to
refuse to recognize the demand for such articulation. This opposition seems to be the
most important knot with which scientific culture is at present grappling, and which
it still does not properly understand. One side insists on its wealth of material and its
intelligibility, the other side scorns this intelligibility at least, and insists on its
immediate rationality and divinity. Even if the former side is reduced to silence,
whether by the force of truth alone or by the browbeating of the other, and even if it
feels overwhelmed with regard to the fundamentals of the Thing, still it is by no
means satisfied regarding the demands it makes: the demands are just, but not
fulfilled. Its silence is only half due to the victory, but half to the boredom and
indifference that are apt to be the consequence of a constantly aroused expectation
and of promises not attended by fulfilment. 1
    ¶15. As for the content, sometimes the others certainly make it easy for themselves
to have a wide range. They draw into their domain a mass of material, namely
---
     

material that is already familiar and well ordered, and by focusing chiefly on oddities
and curiosities they seem all the more to have in their possession everything else that
knowledge has already dealt with in its way, and also to be in control of what is still in
disarray. And so they seem to subject everything to the absolute Idea, which thus
seems to be cognized in everything and to have matured into an expanded science.
But a closer inspection shows that this expansion has not come about through one
and the same principle’s spontaneous adoption of different shapes, but it is rather the
shapeless repetition of one and the same principle, which is just externally applied to
the different material, and acquires a tedious semblance of diversity. The Idea, which
for itself is no doubt true, in fact always remains at its starting-point, if the develop-
ment consists in nothing more than such a repetition of the same formula. When the
knowing subject parades this single immobile form around in whatever is at hand,
when the material is dipped into this stagnant element from outside, this does not
fulfil what is needed any better than arbitrary notions about the content. It is not, that
is, the wealth of shapes surging up from itself and their self-determining differenti-
ation. Rather it is a monochromatic formalism that only arrives at the differentiation
of the material because the material is already prepared and familiar.1
    ¶16. Yet this formalism presents this monotony and abstract universality as the
absolute; it assures us that dissatisfaction with it is an incapacity to master the
absolute standpoint and stick to it. Formerly, the empty possibility of representing
something in another way was sufficient to refute an idea, and this bare possibility,
the universal thought, also had the entire positive value of actual cognition. Here too
we see all value ascribed to the universal Idea in this form of non-actuality, and the
dissolution of the distinct and determinate—or rather their banishment into the
abyss of emptiness with no further development or intrinsic justification—presented
as the speculative approach. To consider some Being-there as it is in the absolute just
consists in saying of it: of course we have spoken of it just now as if it were something,
but in the absolute, the A=A, there is nothing of the sort; in the absolute everything
is one. To pit this single insight, that in the absolute everything is the same,
against discriminating and fulfilled cognition, or cognition seeking and demanding
fulfilment—or to pass off its absolute as the night in which, as the saying goes, all
cows are black—this is the naiveté of emptiness of cognition.—The formalism that
recent philosophy denounced and reviled revived in its very midst, and it will not
disappear from science, though its inadequacy is familiar and felt, until the cognizing
of absolute actuality has become entirely clear about its nature.—A general idea, if it
precedes the attempt to implement it, makes the implementation easier to follow. In
consideration of this, it is useful to give a rough indication of it here, with the
concomitant intention of taking the opportunity to eliminate some forms whose
habitual acceptance is an obstacle for philosophical cognition.1
    ¶17. In my view, which must be justified only by the presentation of the system
itself, everything depends on conceiving and expressing the true not as substance, but
just as much as         subject. At the same time it should be noted that substantiality
includes within itself the universal, or the immediacy of knowledge itself, as well as the
immediacy that is Being or immediacy for knowledge.—If the conception of God as
the one substance shocked the age in which this definition was announced, the reason
for this was on the one hand the instinct that self-consciousness was only submerged
---
                                                                                                       

in it and not preserved. On the other hand, the contrary, which clings to thinking as
thinking, to universality as such, is the same simplicity or undifferentiated, immobile
substantiality. And if, thirdly, thinking unites the Being of substance with itself, and
conceives immediacy or intuition as thinking, then the question is still whether this
intellectual intuition does not fall back again into inert simplicity and does not
present actuality itself in a non-actual manner.1
    ¶ 18. The living substance is, moreover, Being which is in truth subject, or, what
comes to the same thing, Being which is in truth actual only insofar as it is the
movement of self-positing, or is the mediation of becoming-other-to-itself with itself.
As subject, substance is pure simple negativity, and for this very reason the bifurca-
tion of the simple; or the opposing duplication, which is again the negation of this
indifferent diversity and of its opposition: it is only this self-restoring                       equality, or
reflection into itself in otherness—not an original unity as such, or immediate unity
as such—that is the true. The true is the becoming of itself, the circle that presupposes
its end as its goal, and has its end as its beginning, and is only actual through
implementation and its end.1
    ¶19. Thus the life of God and divine cognition may certainly be expressed as
love’s play with itself; this Idea degenerates into edification, and even insipidity, if
the seriousness, the pain, the patience and labour of the negative are missing from
it. In itself   this life is indeed serene equality and unity with itself, which has no
serious concern with otherness and alienation, or with the overcoming of this
alienation. But this in-itself is the abstract universality, in which the nature of this
life, to be for itself, and thus in general the self-movement of the form, are ignored.
If the form is said to be equal to the essence, then it is ipso facto a misunderstanding
to suppose that cognition can be satisfied with the in-itself or the essence, but can
do without the form—that the absolute principle or the absolute intuition makes
the completion of the former, or the development of the latter, superfluous. Just
because the form is as essential to the essence as the essence is to itself, the essence
is not to be conceived and expressed merely as essence, i.e. as immediate substance
or as pure self-intuition of the divine, but just as much as form, and in the whole
wealth of the developed form. Only in this way is it conceived and expressed
as actuality.1
    ¶20. The true is the whole. But the whole is only the essence completing itself
through its development. Of the absolute it must be said that it is essentially result,
that only in the end is it what it is in truth; and precisely in this consists its nature: to
be actual, subject, or becoming-its-own-self. Though it may seem contradictory that
the absolute is to be conceived essentially as result, a brief consideration clears up this
semblance of contradiction. The beginning, the principle, or the absolute, as it is
initially and immediately expressed, is only the universal. If I say ‘all animals’, these
words cannot amount to a zoology; it is equally obvious that such words as the divine,
the absolute, the eternal, etc., do not express what is contained in them;—and only
such words do, in fact, express the intuition as the immediate. Whatever is more than
such a word, even just the transition to a proposition, contains a becoming-other that
must be taken back, is a mediation. But it is mediation that inspires abhorrence, as if
absolute cognition were abandoned when one makes more of mediation than just
this: that it is nothing absolute and has no place in the absolute.1
---
     

    ¶21. But this abhorrence in fact stems from unfamiliarity with the nature of
mediation and of absolute cognition itself. For mediation is nothing other than
self-moving equality-to-itself, or it is reflection into itself, the moment of the I that
is for itself, pure negativity or, reduced to its pure abstraction,                       simple becoming.
Because of its simplicity, the I or becoming in general, this mediating, is precisely
immediacy in the course of becoming, and the immediate itself.—It is therefore a
misunderstanding of reason when reflection is excluded from the true, and is not
conceived as a positive moment of the absolute. It is reflection that makes the true a
result, but also sublates this opposition to its becoming; for this becoming is equally
simple, and therefore does not differ from the form of the true, which consists in
showing itself as        simple    in the result; it is rather just this having-returned into
simplicity.—Though the embryo is indeed human in itself, it is not human for itself;
it is human for itself only as cultivated reason, which has made itself into what it is in
itself. Only this is its actuality. But this result is itself simple immediacy, for it is self-
conscious freedom, which is at rest within itself and has not put opposition aside to
leave it lying there, but is reconciled with it.1
    ¶22. What has been said can also be expressed by saying that reason is purposive
activity. The promotion of what is supposedly nature over misunderstood thinking,
and above all the banishment of external purposiveness, has brought the form of
purpose in general into disrepute. Still, in the way in which Aristotle, too, determines
nature as purposive activity, purpose is the immediate, at rest, the unmoved which is
itself a mover; thus it is subject. Its power to move, taken abstractly, is being-for-itself
or pure negativity. The result is the same as the beginning only because the beginning
is purpose;—or the actual is the same as its concept only because the immediate, as
purpose, has the Self or pure actuality within itself. The accomplished purpose or the
actual realized is movement and unfolded becoming; but it is just this unrest that is
the Self; and the Self is equal to that immediacy and simplicity of the beginning
because it is the result, that which has returned into itself,—but that which has
returned into itself is just the Self, and the Self is the equality and simplicity that
relates itself to itself.1
    ¶23. The need to represent the absolute as subject made use of the propositions:
God is the eternal, or the moral world-order, or love, and so on. In such propositions
the true is only posited directly as subject, not presented as the movement of
reflecting itself into itself. In a proposition of this kind one begins with the word
God. This by itself is a senseless sound, a mere name; only the predicate says what
God is, is his fulfilment and meaning; the empty beginning becomes actual know-
ledge only in this end. In view of this it is hard to see why they do not speak merely of
the eternal, of the moral world-order, etc., or, as the ancients did, of pure concepts,
Being, the one, etc., of that which is the meaning, without adding the senseless sound
as well.1 But it is just this word that indicates that what is posited is not a Being or
essence or universal in general, but something reflected into itself, a subject. Yet at the
same time this is only anticipated. The subject is assumed as a fixed point to which, as
their support, the predicates are attached by means of a movement that belongs to
the one with knowledge of this subject, and which is not considered to belong to the
point itself; yet it is only through this movement that the content would be presented
as subject. Given the way in which this movement is constituted, it cannot belong to
---
                                                                                                        

the subject; yet, in accordance with the presupposition of this point, the movement
too cannot be constituted otherwise, it can only be external. This anticipation that the
absolute is subject is therefore not only not the actuality of this concept, it even makes
this actuality impossible; for the anticipation posits the concept as a static point,
while the actuality is self-movement.2
   ¶24. Among various consequences that flow from what has been said, this one can
be emphasized: knowledge is only actual, and can only be presented, as science or as
system; furthermore, a so-called basic proposition or principle of philosophy, if it is
true, is also false, just insofar as it is only as a basic proposition or principle. It is
therefore easy to refute it. The refutation consists in pointing out its deficiency; and it
is deficient because it is only the universal or principle, only the beginning. If the
refutation is thorough, it is derived and developed from the principle itself,—not
effected from outside by affirmations and suggestions to the contrary. So the refuta-
tion would really be the development of the principle, and thus the repair of its
deficiency, if it did not misunderstand itself by noticing only its                        negative     activity,
while remaining unconscious of its progress and result on the                           positive side.—The
genuine     positive realization of the beginning is at the same time, conversely, just as
much a negative attitude towards it, viz. towards the one-sided form in which it is
only immediate or purpose. And so the realization can also be taken as a refutation of
that which constitutes the basis of the system, but it is more correct to regard it as a
demonstration that the             basis   or the principle of the system is in fact only its
beginning. 1
   ¶25. That the true is actual only as system, or that substance is essentially subject, is
expressed in the representation which casts the absolute as spirit—the most sublime
concept and the one that belongs to the modern age and its religion. The spiritual
alone is the actual; it is the essence, or that-which-is-in-itself,—the interrelating and
determinate, other-being and Being-for-itself—and what remains within itself in this
determinacy or in its being-outside-itself;—or it is                   in and for itself.—But it is this
Being-in-and-for-itself at first only for us or in itself, or it is the spiritual substance. It
must also be this          for itself, it must be the knowledge of the spiritual and the
knowledge of itself as spirit, i.e. it must be as object to itself, but just as immediately
an object sublated, reflected into itself. It is for itself only for us, insofar as its spiritual
content is generated by it itself; but insofar as it is for itself also for its own self, this
self-generation, the pure concept, is at the same time the objective element in which it
has its Being-there, and in this way it is, in its Being-there, for itself an object reflected
into itself.—The spirit that, so developed, knows itself as spirit, is science; science is its
actuality and the realm that it builds for itself in its own element.1
   ¶26. Pure self-cognition in absolute otherness, this aether as such, is the ground
and terrain of science; it is knowledge in its universality. The beginning of philosophy
makes the presupposition or demand that consciousness dwell in this element. But
this element achieves its very perfection and transparency only through the move-
ment of its becoming. It is pure spirituality, as the                   universal that has the mode of
simple immediacy;—this simplicity, when it has existence as simplicity, is the terrain
that is thinking, the terrain that is in the spirit alone. Because this element, this
immediacy of spirit, is the substance in general of spirit, this immediacy is the
transfigured essentiality, the reflection which, itself simple, is for itself immediacy

as such, Being that is reflection into its own self. Science on its side requires of self-
consciousness that it has ascended into this aether in order to be able to live with
science and in science and in order to live with it and in it. Conversely, the individual
has the right to demand that science at least hand him the ladder to this standpoint,
show him this standpoint within himself. His right is based on the absolute inde-
pendence which he knows he possesses in every shape of his knowledge; for in each
one, whether recognized by science or not, and whatever the content may be, the
individual is the absolute form, i.e. he is the immediate certainty of himself and so, if
this expression be preferred, unconditioned Being. The standpoint of consciousness
consists in knowing of objective things in opposition to itself, and in knowing of itself
in opposition to them. If science regards this standpoint as the other—regards that in
which consciousness knows itself to be at home with itself rather as the loss of
spirit—yet conversely the element of science is to consciousness a remote beyond in
which it is no longer in possession of itself. Each of these two parties seems for the
other to be the inverse of the truth. In entrusting itself immediately to science, the
natural consciousness makes an attempt, induced by it knows not what, to walk on its
head as well for once; the compulsion to adopt this unwonted posture and to move
about in it is a seemingly unprepared and needless violence that it is expected to
inflict on itself.—Whatever science may be intrinsically, in its relationship to imme-
diate self-consciousness it presents itself as an inversion of it; or, because this self-
consciousness has the principle of its actuality in the certainty of its own self, science
assumes the form of non-actuality, since this principle is for itself outside science.
Science must therefore combine such an element with itself, or rather show that and
how this element belongs to itself. As long as science lacks such actuality, it is only the
content as the in-itself, the        purpose that is still only an interior, not yet spirit, only
spiritual substance. This in-itself has to come out into the open and become for itself,
and this simply means that this in-itself has to posit self-consciousness as one with
itself.1
   ¶27. It is this becoming of science in general or of knowledge that this phenomen-
ology of spirit presents. Knowledge, as it is initially, or the immediate spirit, is the lack
of spirit, the sensory consciousness. To become authentic knowledge, or to generate
the element of science, which is the pure concept of science itself, it has to work its
way through a long course.—This becoming, as it presents itself in its content and in
the shapes emerging in it, will not be what one initially thinks of as an introduction to
science for the unscientific consciousness; it will also be quite different from the
foundation of science;—at all events it will be different from the enthusiasm which,
like a shot from a pistol, begins immediately with absolute knowledge, and makes
short work of other standpoints by declaring them unworthy of notice.1
   ¶28. The task of leading the individual from his uneducated standpoint to know-
ledge had to be seen in its universal sense, and the universal individual, self-conscious
spirit, had to be considered in its education.—As regards the relationship between the
two types of individual, every moment emerges in the universal individual, as it
acquires its concrete form and its own configuration. The particular individual is the
incomplete spirit, a concrete shape in whose whole Being-there one determinacy is
dominant, while the others are present only in blurred outline. In the spirit that
stands higher than another, the lower concrete Being-there has dwindled to an
---
                                                                                                      

inconspicuous moment; what was formerly the Thing itself is now just a trace; its
shape is shrouded and has become a simple shading. The individual whose substance
is the more elevated spirit runs through this past, in the way in which someone who
takes up a higher science goes through the preparatory information he has long since
absorbed, in order to bring its content to presence; he revives the recollection of it,
without interest in it and without dwelling on it. The singleton must also pass through
the educational stages of the universal spirit with regard to their content, but as shapes
already discarded by the spirit, as stages on a way that has been prepared and levelled.
Thus, as regards information, we see that what in former ages occupied men of
mature spirit, has been reduced to the level of information, exercises, and even games
of boyhood; and, in the pedagogical progression, we shall recognize the history of the
education of the world as if traced in a silhouette. This past Being-there is already
acquired property of the universal spirit that constitutes the substance of the indi-
vidual and so, in appearing externally to him, constitutes his inorganic nature.—In
this respect education, considered from the side of the individual, consists in his
acquiring what is thus present before him, absorbing into himself his inorganic
nature, and taking possession of it for himself. But, considered from the side of the
universal spirit as substance, this is nothing but the fact that the substance gives itself
its self-consciousness, and produces its becoming and its reflection into itself. 1
    ¶29. Science presents this educative movement in all its detail and necessity, as well
as presenting, in its configuration, everything that has already been reduced to a
moment and property of spirit. The goal is spirit’s insight into what knowledge is.
Impatience demands the impossible, namely, the attainment of the goal without the
means. On the one hand, the               length   of this way has to be endured, because each
moment is necessary;—on the other hand, we have to dwell on each moment because
each is itself an entire individual shape and is considered absolutely only insofar as its
determinacy is considered as a whole or a concretion, or the whole is considered in
the peculiarity of this determination.—Since the substance of the individual, since
even the world-spirit has had the patience to pass through these forms in the long
expanse of time, and to undertake the prodigious labour of world-history, in which it
displayed in each form as much of its entire content as that form was capable of
holding, and since the world-spirit could not attain consciousness about itself by any
lighter labour, then in accordance with the Thing the individual certainly cannot
comprehend his own substance with less labour; and yet, at the same time, he has less
trouble, since in itself all this is accomplished,—the content is already the actuality
razed to a possibility, the immediacy overcome, the configuration by now reduced to
its abbreviation, to the simple thought-determination. Already something thought,
the content is property of the substance; it is no longer the Being-there that needs to
be converted into the form of               Being-in-itself, it is rather the         in-itself—no longer
merely in its original state nor immersed in Being-there—but already recollected, that
requires conversion into the form of
must be described more precisely.1                  Being-for-itself. The nature of this operation
    ¶30. At the standpoint at which we here take up this movement, what is bypassed
with regard to the whole is the sublation of                Being-there; but what still remains and
needs a higher reorientation is the representation and the familiarity with the forms.
The Being-there taken back into the substance is, by that                         first negation, at       first

transposed into the element of the Self only immediately; so this property that the Self
has acquired still has the same character of unconceptualized immediacy, of immo-
bile indifference, as Being-there itself has; Being-there has thus merely passed over
into representation.—At the same time it is thereby something                          familiar, something
that the spirit that-is-there has finished with, in which therefore this spirit no longer
invests its activity nor, consequently, its interest. If the activity, which has finished
with Being-there, is itself only the movement of the particular spirit that does not
comprehend itself, knowledge, by contrast, is directed against the representation thus
created, against this familiarity; knowledge is the doing of the universal Self and the
interest of thinking.1
    ¶31. The familiar in general, precisely because it is well-known, is not known. The
commonest way in which we deceive ourselves and deceive others is to presuppose in
inquiry something as familiar, and to accept it automatically; for all its talking to and
fro, such knowing never gets anywhere, and it does not know what is happening to it.
Subject and object, God, nature, understanding, sensibility, and so on, are indiscrim-
inately presupposed as familiar and as valid foundations, and constitute fixed points
for both departure and return. The movement proceeds back and forth between these
points, while they remain unmoved, and so it only skims their surface. So appre-
hending and testing too consist in seeing whether everyone finds what is said about
these in his representation as well, whether it seems that way to him, and is familiar
or not.1
    ¶32. The     analysis    of a representation, as it used to be carried out, was already
nothing other than the sublation of the form of its familiarity. To dissect a represen-
tation into its original elements is to return to its moments, which at least do not have
the form of the representation as we encounter it, but constitute the immediate
property of the Self. This analysis, to be sure, only arrives at                       thoughts     which are
themselves familiar, fixed, and static determinations. But what is thus separated, this
non-actuality, is itself an essential moment; for the concrete is what moves itself,
only because it divides itself and makes itself something non-actual. The activity of
division is the force and labour of the                 understanding, the most astonishing and
greatest of powers, or rather the absolute power. The circle that remains self-enclosed
and, as substance, holds its moments, is the immediate relationship and therefore
arouses no astonishment. But that the accidental as such, detached from its sur-
roundings, that what is bound and is actual only in its connection with other things,
attains a Being-there of its own and a separate freedom—this is the tremendous
power of the negative; it is the energy of thinking, of the pure I. Death, if that is what
we want to call this non-actuality, is the most dreadful thing, and to hold fast what is
dead requires the greatest force. Beauty without force hates the understanding
because the understanding expects this of her when she cannot do it. But the life of
the spirit is not the life that shrinks from death and keeps clear of devastation;—it is
the life that endures death and preserves itself in it. Spirit gains its truth only when, in
absolute disintegration, it finds itself. It is this power, not as the positive which averts
its eyes from the negative, as when we say of something that it is nothing or false, and
then, finished with it, turn away and pass on to something else; spirit is this power
only by looking the negative in the face, and by dwelling on it. Dwelling on the
negative is the magic force that converts it into Being.—This force is the very thing

that we earlier called the subject, the subject which, by giving in its own element
Being-there to determinacy, sublates abstract immediacy, i.e. the immediacy which
simply is in general, and is thereby genuine substance: the Being or immediacy that
does not have mediation outside it but which is this mediation itself.1
   ¶33. What is represented becomes property of pure self-consciousness, but this
elevation to universality in general is only one side of education, not yet its
completion.—In antiquity study differed in kind from that of modern times: it was
the really thorough education of the natural consciousness. Trying its strength
specifically on every part of its Being-there, and philosophizing about everything it
came across, it made itself into a universality that was active through and through. In
modern times, by contrast, the individual                finds the abstract form ready-made; the
effort to grasp it and to make it his own is more the unmediated eruption of
the interior and the truncated generation of the universal than an emergence of the
universal from the concrete and from the diversity of Being-there. That is why the task
now consists not so much in purging the individual of the mode of sensory immedi-
acy, and making him into a substance that thinks and is thought, but rather in the
opposite, in actualizing and inspiriting the universal by sublating fixed, determinate
thoughts. But it is far harder to bring fixed thoughts into a fluid state than sensory
Being-there. The reason for this is what we said just now: these determinations have
the I, the power of the negative, or pure actuality, as the substance and the element
of their Being-there, whereas sensory determinations have only powerless, abstract
immediacy, or Being as such. Thoughts become                        fluid when pure thinking, this
inner immediacy, recognizes itself as a moment, or when the pure certainty of itself
abstracts from itself;—not by leaving itself out, by setting itself aside, but by giving
up the    fixity  of its self-positing, both the fixity of the pure concrete, which is the
I itself in contrast to differentiated content, and the fixity of the differentiations
which, posited in the element of pure thinking, have a share in that uncondition-
ality of the I. Through this movement the pure thoughts become concepts, and are
only now what they are in truth, self-movements, circles, that which is their
substance, spiritual essentialities.1
   ¶34. This movement of pure essentialities constitutes the nature of scientificity in
general. Regarded as the interconnection of their content, the movement is the
necessity of the content and the expansion of it into an organic whole. Through
this movement the route by which the concept of knowledge is reached becomes
likewise a necessary and complete becoming. And so this preparation ceases to be
a contingent philosophizing that latches onto any old objects, relationships, and
thoughts of the imperfect consciousness, as they occur by chance, or tries to establish
the true by arguing the pros and cons, by inferences and conclusions from deter-
minate thoughts. Instead, this route will encompass, through the movement of the
concept, all the worldliness of consciousness in its necessity.1
   ¶35. Further, an exposition of this sort constitutes the first part of science, because
the Being-there of spirit at its outset is nothing but the immediate or the beginning,
but the beginning is not yet its return into itself. The element of immediate Being-
there is therefore the determinacy that distinguishes this part of science from the
others.—Mention of this difference leads us into a discussion of some fixed thoughts
which tend to crop up in this context.1

     

    ¶36. The immediate Being-there of spirit, consciousness, has two moments: know-
ing and the objectivity which is negative to knowing. Since consciousness is the
element in which spirit develops itself and unfolds its moments, this opposition
pertains to the moments, and they all emerge as shapes of consciousness. The science
of this journey is the science of the              experience     that consciousness undergoes; the
substance is considered inasmuch as it and its movement are an object of conscious-
ness. Consciousness knows and comprehends nothing but what is in its experience;
for what is in its experience is only the spiritual substance, and in fact as                        object  of
substance’s Self. But spirit becomes object because it is this movement of becoming
an other to itself, i.e. object of its Self, and of sublating this otherness. And experience
is the name given to just this movement, in which the immediate, what is not
experienced, i.e. the abstract, whether the abstraction of sensory Being or of the
mere simple thought, alienates itself and then returns to itself from this alienation,
and is now displayed for the first time in its actuality and truth, and is also property of
consciousness.1
    ¶37. The disparity occurring in consciousness between the I and the substance that
is its object is the distinction between them, the negative in general. The negative can
be regarded as the defect of both, but it is their soul, or that which moves them; that is
why some of the ancients conceived the void as the mover, since they grasped that the
mover is the negative, though they did not yet grasp that the negative is the Self. 1—
Now if this negative appears initially as a disparity between the I and the object, it is
just as much the disparity between the substance and itself. What seems to proceed
outside substance, what seems to be an activity directed against it, is its own doing,
and substance shows itself to be essentially subject. When it has shown this com-
pletely, spirit has made its Being-there equal to its essence; it is object to itself, just as
it is, and the abstract element of immediacy, and of the separation of knowledge and
truth, is overcome. Being is absolutely mediated;—it is substantial content which is
just as immediately property of the I, it is selfish or the concept. With this the
phenomenology of spirit is concluded. What spirit prepares for itself in it, is the
element of knowledge. In this element the moments of spirit now spread themselves
out in the form of simplicity, which knows its object as its own self. They no longer fall
apart into the opposition of Being and knowledge, but remain in the simplicity of
knowledge; they are the true in the form of the true, and their diversity is only
diversity of content. Their movement, which organizes itself in this element into a
whole, is logic or speculative philosophy. 2
    ¶38. Now because the system of spirit’s experience deals only with the appearance
of spirit, the advance from this system to the science of the true that is in the shape of
the true seems to be merely negative, and one might wish to remain exempted from
the negative inasmuch as it is the             false, and demand to be led to the truth without
more ado; why bother with the false?—The view that we should begin with science
straight away, has already been discussed above. Our answer to it here needs to focus
on the question of the constitution of the negative in general regarded as the false.
Representations on this question especially obstruct the approach to truth. It will give
us occasion to speak about mathematical cognition, which unphilosophical know-
ledge regards as the ideal that philosophy must strive to attain, though it has so far
striven in vain.1

                                                                                                     

    ¶39. The     true and the      false  belong to those determinate thoughts that count as
motionless, essences on their own, one of which is on one side, while the other is on
the other, each standing fixed and isolated with nothing in common with the other.
Against this view it must maintained that truth is not a minted coin that is ready to be
given and pocketed just as it is. Nor is there a false, any more than there is an evil. The
evil and the false are not, of course, as bad as the devil, for in the devil they are even
made into a particular           subject; as the false and the evil, they are only                universals,
though each has its own essentiality in contrast to the other.—The false (for here it is
only of this that we speak) would be the other of substance, its negative, while
substance, as content of knowledge, is the true. But substance is itself essentially
the negative, partly as differentiation and determination of the content, partly as a
simple    differentiating, i.e. as Self and knowledge in general. One can surely know
falsely. If something is known falsely, this means that knowledge is in disparity with
its substance. But in fact this disparity is differentiating in general, which is an
essential moment. Out of this differentiating, to be sure, their parity emerges, and
this emergent parity is the truth. But it is not truth in such a way that the disparity has
been discarded, like dross from pure metal, not even like the tool that remains
detached from the           finished vessel; in the true as such, disparity is itself still
immediately present as the negative, as the Self. However, this does not mean
that we can say that the false constitutes a moment, let alone a component, of the
true. ‘In every falsehood there is something true’—in this saying truth and falsity
are treated like oil and water, which cannot be mixed and are only externally
combined. It is precisely because of the significance of designating the moment of
complete otherness that the expressions for truth and falsity must no longer be used
where their otherness has been sublated. Similarly, talk of the unity of subject and
object, of     finite and infinite, of Being and thinking, etc. has the drawback, that
object and subject, etc. signify what they are outside their unity, and so in their unity
they are not meant to be what their expression suggests; in the same way the false is
no longer, as false, a moment of truth.1
    ¶40. Dogmatism as a way of thinking in knowledge and in the study of philosophy
is nothing but the opinion that the true consists in a proposition which is a fixed
result, or which is immediately known. To such questions as when was Caesar born,
how many yards there were in a stadium and which stadium, etc., a clear-cut answer
should be given, just as it is definitely true that the square on the hypotenuse is equal
to the sum of the squares on the other two sides of a right-angled triangle. But the
nature of a so-called truth of that kind is different from the nature of philosophical
truths.1
    ¶41. As regards historical truths (to mention these briefly), insofar as their purely
historical aspect is considered, it is readily granted that they concern the singular
Being-there, the contingent and arbitrary aspect of a content, determinations of it
that are not necessary.—But even such plain truths as the examples cited are not
without the movement of self-consciousness. To know one of them, a good deal of
comparison is called for, books must be consulted, or in some way or other research
has to be undertaken; even in the case of an immediate intuition only the knowledge
of the intuition along with its grounds is regarded as something of true value,
although it is really only the bare result that we are supposed to be concerned about.1

     

    ¶42. As for mathematical truths, we would be even less likely to regard someone as
a geometer if he knew Euclid’s theorems outwardly by rote, without knowing their
proofs, without (as we might express the contrast) knowing them inwardly. Similarly,
the information that the sides of right-angled triangles have the familiar relationship
to each other, would be regarded as unsatisfactory, if someone were to acquire it by
measuring many right-angled triangles. However, even in mathematical cognition,
the essentialness of the proof does not yet have the significance and nature of being a
moment of the result itself; in the result the proof is past and vanished. Since it is a
result, the theorem is of course a theorem seen to be true. But this added circumstance
does not affect its content, but only the relationship to the subject; the movement of
the mathematical proof does not belong to that which is the object; it is an operation
external to the Thing. Thus the nature of the right-angled triangle does not divide
itself up in just the way presented in the construction that is needed for the proof of
the proposition expressing its relationship; the entire production of the result is a
process and means of cognition.—In philosophical cognition, too, the becoming of
the Being-there as Being-there is different from the becoming of the essence or of the
inner nature of the Thing. But in the first place philosophical cognition includes both,
whereas mathematical cognition presents only the becoming of the Being-there, i.e.
the becoming of the          Being of the nature of the Thing in              cognition as such. In the
second place, philosophical cognition also unifies these two particular movements.
The inner emergence or becoming of the substance is an uninterrupted passage into
externality or into Being-there, Being for another, and conversely the becoming of the
Being-there is the withdrawal into the essence. The movement is the twofold process
and becoming of the whole, so that each one at the same time posits the other, and
each therefore also has both of them in it as two aspects; together they make up the
whole by dissolving themselves and making themselves into its moments.1
    ¶43. In mathematical cognition, insight is, for the Thing, an external operation; it
follows from this that the true Thing is altered thereby. So while the means—
construction and proof—no doubt contain true propositions, it must equally be
said that the content is false. In the above example the triangle is dismembered,
and its parts consigned to other             figures, to which the construction gives rise in it.
Only at the end is the triangle restored, the triangle we are really dealing with, which
was lost from sight during the procedure, emerging only in fragments belonging to
other wholes.—So here we see the negativity of the content coming in as well; this
negativity would have to be called a falsity of the content, with as much right as the
disappearance of purportedly fixed thoughts in the movement of the concept. 1
    ¶44. But the real deficiency of this cognition concerns the cognition itself, as well as
its material in general.—As regards the cognition, we do not, for the time being, see
the necessity of the construction. It does not emerge from the concept of the theorem;
it is rather imposed, and the instruction to draw just these lines when infinitely many
others could be drawn has to be blindly obeyed without our knowing anything more
than how to have the innocent faith that this will serve the purpose of carrying out
the proof. Afterwards, this purposiveness also reveals itself, and for this reason it is
only an external purposiveness, because it reveals itself only afterwards in the course
of proof.—Similarly, the proof follows a path that begins somewhere, at a point
whose relation to the result that is supposed to emerge is not yet known. As it

advances it takes up these determinations and relations, and leaves others aside, in
accordance with a necessity that we do not immediately discern; an external purpose
governs this movement.1
    ¶45. Mathematics is proud of the                self-evidence    of this defective cognition, and
flaunts it even in the face of philosophy, but it is based solely on the poverty of its
purpose and the defectiveness of its material, and is therefore of a kind that philoso-
phy must disdain.—The             purpose     or concept of mathematics is magnitude. This is
precisely the inessential, unconceptual relationship. Accordingly, the movement of
knowing proceeds on the surface, does not touch the Thing itself, not the essence or
the concept, and is therefore no conceptual comprehension.—The material, regard-
ing which mathematics provides a gratifying treasury of truths, is space and the unit.
Space is the Being-there in which the concept inscribes its distinctions as in an empty
dead element, in which they are just as motionless and lifeless. The                           actual  is not
something spatial, as it is considered in mathematics; neither concrete sensory intuition
nor philosophy is concerned with such non-actuality as the things of mathematics are.
In such a non-actual element there is after all only non-actual truth, i.e. rigid, dead
propositions; we can stop at any one of them; the next proposition starts for itself anew,
without the first proposition moving on to the other, and without a necessary connec-
tion arising in this way through the nature of the Thing itself.—Moreover, because of
this principle and element—and herein consists the formalism of mathematical self-
evidence—knowledge proceeds on the line of equality. For what is dead, since it does
not move itself, does not arrive at distinctions of essence, at essential opposition or
inequality, nor therefore at the passage of opposite into opposite, does not attain to
qualitative, immanent movement, to self-movement. For it is only magnitude, the
unessential distinction, that mathematics considers. It abstracts from the fact that it is
the concept that divides space into its dimensions and determines the connections
between them and within them; it does not, for example, consider the relationship of
the line to the surface; and when it compares the diameter of the circle with the
circumference, it runs up against their incommensurability, i.e. a relationship of the
concept, an infinite that eludes mathematical determination.1
    ¶46. Immanent, so-called pure mathematics also does not place time as time in
juxtaposition to space, as the second material of its consideration. Applied mathem-
atics does indeed deal with time, as well as with motion and other actual things; but it
takes up the synthetic propositions, i.e. propositions about their relationships which
are determined by their concept, from experience, and only applies its formulae to
these presuppositions. Applied mathematics often gives so-called proofs of proposi-
tions, such as those regarding the equilibrium of the lever, or the relationship of space
and time in the motion of falling, etc., but the fact that these are presented and
accepted as proofs itself only proves how great is the need of proof for cognition,
because where it has nothing else, cognition respects even the empty semblance of
proof, and gains some satisfaction from it. A critique of these proofs would be both
noteworthy and instructive, serving both to purify mathematics of this false adorn-
ment, and to show its limit, and hence the necessity of another kind of knowledge.—
As regards time, one would suppose that it would constitute, as the counterpart of
space, the material of the other part of pure mathematics; but it is the concept itself
that is-there. The principle of              magnitude, of unconceptual difference, and the
---
     

principle of equality, of abstract lifeless unity, cannot handle that pure unrest of life
and of absolute differentiation. It is therefore only as paralysed, namely as the unit,
that this negativity becomes the second material of mathematical cognition, which, as
an external operation, reduces what is self-moving to material, in order to have in it
now an indifferent, external, lifeless content.1
    ¶47. Philosophy, by contrast, considers not the inessential determination, but the
determination insofar as it is essential; its element and content is not the abstract or
non-actual, but the actual, that which posits itself and lives within itself—Being-there
in its concept. It is the process that generates and passes through its own moments,
and this whole movement constitutes the positive and its truth. This truth therefore
includes the negative too, that which would be called the false, if it could be regarded
as something from which one should abstract. The evanescent should, on the
contrary, itself be regarded as essential, not in the determination of a fixture which,
cut off from the true, is to be left lying somewhere or other outside it, any more than
the true is to be regarded as a dead, static positive on the other side. Appearance is the
arising and passing away that does not itself arise and pass away, but is in itself and
constitutes the actuality and movement of the life of truth. The true is thus the
Bacchanalian frenzy in which no member is sober, and since each member immedi-
ately dissolves as soon as it breaks away, the frenzy is also transparent and simple
repose. In that movement’s court of judgement, of course the single shapes of spirit
do not subsist any more than determinate thoughts do, but they are also positive and
necessary moments, as much as they are negative and evanescent.—In the whole of
the movement, a whole conceived as repose, what differentiates itself in the move-
ment and gives itself particular Being-there, is preserved as something that recollects
itself, whose Being-there is knowledge of its own self, while this self-knowledge is just
as immediately Being-there.1
    ¶48. It might seem necessary to specify in advance the main features of the method
of this movement or of science. But its concept already lies in what we have said and
its proper exposition belongs to logic, or rather it is logic itself. For the method is
nothing but the structure of the whole set out in its pure essentiality. But as for the
views on this matter that have been prevalent until now, we must not forget that the
system of ideas relating to the nature of philosophical method also belongs to a
defunct culture.—If this should sound boastful or revolutionary, a tone that is far
from my intention, we should bear in mind that the scientific                            finery offered by
mathematics—with its explanations, classifications, axioms, sequences of theorems,
their proofs, principles, and the derivation of consequences and conclusions from
them—is in the general opinion already                     obsolete    at the very least. Even if its
unsuitability is not clearly seen, little or no use is made of it any more, and if people
do not disapprove of it in itself, they are nevertheless not fond of it. And we must
harbour this prejudice in favour of excellence, that it finds a use for itself and wins
popularity. But it is not hard to see that the fashion of advancing a proposition,
adducing reasons for it, and in the same way refuting the opposite proposition by
reasons, is not the form in which truth can emerge. Truth is the movement of itself
inside itself, whereas this method is the cognition that is external to the material. That
is why this method is peculiar to mathematics, and must be left to mathematics,
which, as we noted, has the unconceptual relationship of magnitude as its principle,
---
                                                                                              

and dead space and the equally dead unit as its material. This method may also, in a
freer style, i.e. blended more with wilfulness and contingency, remain in ordinary life,
in a conversation or historical instruction for the sake of curiosity more than
cognition, more or less like a preface too. In ordinary life, consciousness has for its
content information, experiences, sensory concretions, also thoughts, principles—in
general whatever it regards as available or as a fixed and stable Being or essence.
Sometimes consciousness follows where this leads, sometimes it interrupts the
connection by exercising free wilfulness over such content and conducts itself as an
external determination and management of the content. It traces the content back to
some certainty or other, even if it is only the sensation of the moment; and conviction
is satisfied when it has reached a familiar resting-place. 1
    ¶49. But if the necessity of the concept banishes the looser gait of ratiocinative 1
conversation, as well as the stiffer gait of scientific pomp, we have already pointed out
above that their place is not to be             filled by the non-method of presentiment and
inspiration, and by the wilfulness of prophetic utterance, which despises not only that
type of science, but the scientific approach in general.
    ¶50. Kant rediscovered          triplicity and, though he found it only by instinct and it
was, in his hands, still dead, still unconceptualized, it has since been elevated to its
absolute meaning, so that the genuine form is at the same time displayed in its
genuine content and the concept of science has emerged. Nevertheless, we sometimes
see this form used in a way that degrades it to a lifeless schema, to a veritable shadow,
reducing scientific organization to a chart; this use too is not to be regarded as
anything to do with science.—This formalism, of which we have already spoken
generally and whose style we wish here to specify in more detail, supposes that it has
comprehended and expressed the nature and the life of a shape when it has affirmed
of it some determination of the schema as a predicate—it may be subjectivity or
objectivity or, again, magnetism, electricity, etc., contraction or expansion, east or
west, and the like. This can be multiplied to infinity, since in this way each deter-
mination or shape can be used again as a form or moment of the schema in the case
of the other determination or shape, and each can gratefully perform the same service
for the other—a circle of reciprocity by which one does not experience what the
Thing itself is, not what the one is nor what the other is. Here, sometimes sensory
determinations are taken up from ordinary intuition, and they are supposed, of
course, to     mean    something other than what they say; sometimes what is in itself
meaningful, the pure determinations of thought, such as subject, object, substance,
cause, the universal, etc., are used just as indiscriminately and uncritically as they are
in ordinary life, and as are strengths and weaknesses, expansion and contraction, so
that this metaphysics is as unscientific as these sensory representations. 1
    ¶51. Instead of the inner life and the self-movement of its Being-there, such a
simple determinacy of intuition—that is, in this case, sensory knowledge—is now
expressed according to a superficial analogy, and this external and empty application
of the formula is called construction.—The case with this sort of formalism is the
same as with any other. What sort of blockhead would someone have to be, if he
could not be taught in a quarter of an hour the theory that there are asthenic, sthenic,
and indirectly asthenic diseases, and as many types of cure, and if he could not hope,
since until quite recently such instruction still sufficed for the purpose, to be
---
     

transformed in this short time from a family doctor into a theoretical physician?
When the formalism of the philosophy of nature teaches, say, that the intellect is
electricity, or the animal is nitrogen or, again, equal                 to the south or north, etc., or
represents it by a proxy, whether as baldly as it is expressed here or concocted with
more technical terminology, then inexperience may be overcome by admiration and
amazement at such force, which grasps together the seemingly remote, and at the
violence that the inert sensory undergoes through this combination, a violence that
imparts to the sensory the semblance of a concept but shirks the main Thing, which
is to express the concept itself or the meaning of the sensory representation. Inex-
perience may venerate in all this a profound genius. It may delight, too, in the lustre
of such determinations, since they replace the abstract concept with intuitive clarity
and make it more gratifying; and it may congratulate itself on the kinship of soul it
feels with such a splendid performance. The knack of this kind of wisdom is as
quickly learned as it is easy to practise; the repetition of it, when it is familiar,
becomes as insufferable as the repetition of a conjuring trick already seen through.
The instrument of this monotonous formalism is no harder to handle than a painter’s
palette having only two colours, say red and green, the red for colouring the surface
when a historical scene is required, the green for landscapes.—It would be hard to
decide which is greater here, the ease with which everything in heaven and on earth
and under the earth is coated with this broth of colour, or the vain pride in the
excellence of this universal recipe: each supports the other. This method sticks the
few determinations of the universal schema onto everything heavenly and terrestrial,
on all natural and spiritual formations, in this way classifying everything; and what it
produces is nothing less than a report as clear as daylight on the organism of the
universe, that is, a chart resembling a skeleton with bits of paper stuck on it, or like
the rows of closed boxes, with labels attached, in a spice-seller’s stall. The chart is as
clear as each of these; and just as in the first case flesh and blood has been removed
from the bones, while in the second case the Thing, also bereft of life, is hidden in the
boxes, so too the chart has left out or hidden the living essence of the Thing.—We
have already remarked that this approach at the same time culminates in mono-
chrome, absolute painting: ashamed of the distinctions of the schema, it submerges
them, as belonging to reflection, in the emptiness of the absolute, so that pure
identity, formless white, is produced. This uniform colouring of the schema and of
its lifeless determinations, this absolute identity, and the transition from one to the
other, are all alike dead understanding and all alike external cognition.1
    ¶52. Excellence cannot escape the fate of being thus robbed of life and spirit, of
being    flayed and then seeing its skin wrapped around lifeless knowledge and its
vanity. But that is only part of the picture. In this very fate we can discern the power
that excellence exerts on hearts, if not on minds, as well as the development to
universality and determinacy of form in which its perfection consists, and which
alone makes it possible for this universality to be used in a superficial way. 1
    ¶53. Science has to organize itself only by the concept’s own life; the determinacy
that is taken from the schema and externally stuck onto Being-there, is, in science, the
self-moving soul of the fulfilled content. The movement of that which is consists, on
the one hand, in becoming an other to itself, and so becoming its own immanent
content; on the other hand, that which is takes back into itself this unfolding or this
---
                                                                                                       

Being-there of itself, that is, it makes itself a                  moment      and simplifies itself into
determinacy. In the first movement, negativity is the distinguishing and the positing
of   Being-there; in this return into itself, it is the becoming of the                           determinate
simplicity. It is in this way that the content shows that its determinacy is not received
from something else and fastened on it, but it gives determinacy to itself and ranges
itself by itself to a moment and to a place in the whole. The tabular understanding
keeps for itself the necessity and the concept of the content, keeps for itself what
constitutes the concreteness, the actuality, and living movement of the Thing that it
arranges; or rather, it does not keep this for itself, it is not even aware of it; for if it had
this insight, it would surely reveal it. It is not even aware of the need for such insight;
otherwise it would abandon its schematizing, or at least realize that it is no more use
to it than a table of contents. A table of contents is all that the understanding gives,
the content itself it does not supply.—Even when the determinacy, one such as
magnetism for example, is in itself concrete or actual, it is still reduced to something
dead, since it is only predicated of another Being-there and not cognized as imma-
nent life of this Being-there, or as having its native and peculiar self-generation and
presentation in this Being-there. To add this main Thing is something the formal
understanding leaves to others.—Instead of entering into the immanent content of
the Thing, the understanding always surveys the whole and stands above the singular
Being-there of which it speaks, that is, it does not see it at all. Scientific cognition, by
contrast, requires one to surrender to the life of the object, or, what amounts to the
same thing, to focus on and express its inner necessity. Immersing itself thus in its
object, scientific cognition forgets that survey, which is merely the reflection of
knowledge away from the content and into itself. But engrossed in the material
and moving forward along with it, scientific cognition does return into itself, but not
before the filling or content withdraws into itself, simplifies itself into determinacy,
reduces itself to one side of a Being-there and passes over into its higher truth. In this
way the simple, self-surveying whole itself emerges from the wealth in which its
reflection seemed lost. 1
    ¶54. In general, because, as we expressed it above, substance is inherently subject,
all content is its own reflection into itself. The subsistence or substance of its Being-
there is equality-with-itself; for its inequality with itself would be its dissolution.
Equality-with-self, however, is pure abstraction; and pure abstraction is                             thinking.
When I say quality, I mean the simple determinacy; in virtue of the quality a Being-
there is distinct from another, or is a Being-there; it is for itself, or it subsists in virtue
of this simple uniformity with itself. But it is thereby essentially the thought.—It is
comprehended in this that Being is thinking; this is the source of the insight which
usually eludes the ordinary unconceptual talk about the identity of thinking and
Being.—Now because the subsistence of the Being-there is equality-with-itself or
pure abstraction, it is the abstraction of itself from itself, or it is itself its inequality
with itself and its dissolution,—its own inwardness and withdrawal into itself,—its
becoming.—Because this is the nature of that which is, and insofar as that which is
has this nature for knowledge, knowledge is not the activity that deals with the
content as something alien, is not reflection-into-itself away from the content;
science is not that idealism which took the place of the dogmatism of assertion as a
dogmatism of assurance or the dogmatism of certainty of one’s own self; on the
---
     

contrary, since knowledge sees the content returning into its own inwardness, its
activity is both absorbed in the content, for it is the immanent Self of the content, and
at the same time it has returned into itself, for it is pure equality-with-itself in
otherness; thus it is the cunning which, while seeming to abstain from activity,
watches to see how determinacy and its concrete life, just where it supposes it is
pursuing its own self-preservation and particular interest, is the reverse, a doing that
dissolves itself and makes itself a moment of the whole.1
    ¶55. Earlier we specified the significance of the understanding with regard to the
self-consciousness of substance; we can now see clearly from what has been said
here its significance with respect to the determination of substance as it simply
is.—Being-there is quality, determinacy equal-to-itself or determinate simplicity,
determinate thought; this is the understanding of Being-there. Consequently, Being-
there is    nous, which        Anaxagoras       was the     first to recognize as the essence. His
successors conceived the nature of Being-there more determinately as eidos or idea,
that is, determinate universality, kind. The expression kind may seem too common-
place and too slight for the Ideas, for the beautiful and holy and eternal, which are all
the rage nowadays. But in fact the Idea expresses neither more nor less than kind. But
nowadays we often see an expression which determinately designates a concept
spurned in favour of one which, if only because it belongs to a foreign language,
shrouds the concept in fog and hence sounds more edifying.—Precisely because
Being-there is determined as kind, it is simple thought; the nous, simplicity, is the
substance. On account of its simplicity or equality-with-itself substance appears as
fixed and enduring. But this equality-with-itself is also negativity; that is why that firm
Being-there passes over into its dissolution. At first the determinacy seems to be what
it is only because it is related to an other, and its movement seems to be imposed on it
by an alien power; but it is precisely involved in this simplicity of thinking itself that
the determinacy has its very otherness in it and is self-movement; for this simplicity is
the self-moving and self-differentiating thought, it is its own inwardness, the pure
concept. Thus the         intellectuality of the understanding             is a becoming and, as this
becoming, it is rationality.1
    ¶56. It is the nature of that which is, to be its own concept in its Being, and it is in
this nature that in general logical necessity consists. This alone is the rationality and
the rhythm of the organic whole; it is knowledge of the content, just as much as the
content is concept and essence—or it alone is the speculative.—The concrete shape,
moving itself, makes itself into a simple determinacy; it thereby raises itself to logical
form, and is in its essentiality; its concrete Being-there is just this movement, and is
immediately logical Being-there. That is why it is unnecessary to impose formalism
on the content externally; the content is inherently a transition to formalism, which
ceases, however, to be this external formalism, since the form is the native becoming
of the concrete content itself.1
    ¶57. So this is the nature of scientific method, first, to be inseparable from the
content, and secondly, to determine its own rhythm by itself; as we have already
remarked, this nature has its proper presentation in speculative philosophy.—What
we have said here does express the concept, but cannot count for more than an
anticipatory assurance. Its truth does not lie in this partly narrative exposition, and is
therefore just as little refuted by assuring us that, on the contrary, it is not so, that
---
                                                                                                       

such and such is rather the case, by calling to mind and reciting conventional ideas, as
if they were settled and familiar truths, or again by assuring us of novelties served up
from the shrine of inner divine intuition.—This sort of reception is usually the first
reaction on the part of knowledge to something unfamiliar: it resists it in order to
save its freedom and its own insight, its own authority, from the alien authority (for
this is the guise in which what is newly encountered first appears)—also to get rid of
the semblance that something has been learned and of the kind of shame this is
supposed to involve. Similarly, when the unfamiliar is greeted with applause, the
reaction is of the same kind, and consists in what in another sphere was ultra-
revolutionary speech and action.1
    ¶58. The important thing, therefore, in the study of science, is to take on oneself the
exertion of the concept. This requires attention to the concept as such, to the simple
determinations, e.g. of being-in-itself, being-for-itself, equality-with-self, etc.; for these
are pure self-movements such as could be called souls if their concept did not
designate something higher than soul. The habit of running on in representations,
when it is interrupted by the concept, finds it just as irksome as does formal thinking
that ratiocinates back and forth in thoughts bereft of actuality. That habit should be
called a material thinking, a contingent consciousness that is absorbed only in the
stuff, and therefore finds it painful at the same time to lift its Self clear of the matter,
and to be together with itself. By contrast, the other mode, ratiocination, is freedom
from content and vain condescension towards it; what is required of it is the effort to
give up this freedom and, instead of being the wilfully moving principle of the
content, to submerge this freedom in it, to let the content move by its own nature,
that is, by the Self as its own Self, and to contemplate this movement. Renunciation of
personal intrusion into the immanent rhythm of concepts, avoidance of intervention
in the rhythm with wilfulness and wisdom garnered elsewhere, this abstention is itself
an essential moment of attention to the concept.1
    ¶59. In the ratiocinative attitude we need to pay more attention to the two aspects
in respect to which conceptual thinking is opposed to it.—First, it adopts a negative
attitude towards the content it apprehends; it knows how to refute it and annihilate it.
That something is not the case,—this insight is the merely negative; it is a dead end
that does not lead to a new content beyond itself; in order to have a content again,
something else must be taken on from somewhere. Ratiocination is reflection into the
empty I, the vanity of its knowledge.—But this vanity expresses not only the vanity of
this content, but also the vanity of this insight itself; for this insight is the negative
that does not see the positive within itself. Because this reflection does not get its own
negativity as its content, it never gets inside the Thing, but is always beyond it; for this
reason it imagines that with its affirmation of the void it is always way ahead of an
insight rich in content. By contrast, in conceptual thinking, as we have shown above,
the negative belongs to the content itself, and is the positive, both as the immanent
movement and determination of the content, and as the whole of this movement.
Conceived as a result, it is what emerges from this movement, the                                determinate
negative, and consequently a positive content as well. 1
    ¶60. But in view of the fact that such thinking has a content, whether of repre-
sentations or thoughts or a mixture of both, it has another aspect which makes
comprehension difficult for it. The remarkable nature of this aspect is closely
---
     

connected with the above-mentioned essence of the Idea itself, or rather it expresses
the Idea in its appearance as the movement which is thinking apprehension.—For
whereas, in its negative attitude, which we have just discussed, ratiocinative thinking
is itself the Self into which the content returns, in its positive cognition, by contrast,
the Self is a represented          subject    to which the content is related as accident and
predicate. This subject constitutes the basis to which the content is attached, and
upon which the movement runs back and forth. Conceptual thinking adopts a
different approach. Since the concept is the object’s own Self, which presents itself
as  its becoming, it is not a static subject, which supports the accidents without
moving; it is, on the contrary, the concept that moves itself and takes its determin-
ations back into itself. In this movement the static subject itself perishes; it enters into
the differences and the content, and it constitutes the determinacy, i.e. the differen-
tiated content as well as its movement, instead of remaining opposed to it. The firm
ground which ratiocination has in the static subject therefore shudders, and only this
movement itself becomes the object. The subject that fulfils its content ceases to go
beyond it, and cannot have any other predicates or accidents. Conversely, the
dispersion of the content is thereby bound together under the Self; the content is
not the universal which, free of the subject, would fit several. And so the content is, in
fact, no longer a predicate of the subject; it is the substance, it is the essence and the
concept of what we are talking about. It is the nature of representational thinking to
follow the accidents or predicates and to go beyond them, and rightly so, since they
are nothing more than predicates and accidents; but it is stopped in its tracks, when
what has the form of a predicate in a proposition is the substance itself. It suffers, as
we might represent it, a counter-thrust. It starts from the subject as if this remained
the underlying ground, but since the predicate is really the substance, it finds that the
subject has passed over into the predicate and has thereby been sublated; and, since in
this way what seems to be the predicate has become the whole and independent mass,
thinking cannot roam about freely, but is impeded by this weight.—Usually, the
subject is first made the ground, as the objective, fixed Self; from there the necessary
movement proceeds to the multiplicity of determinations or predicates. Here, the
knowing I itself comes in to take the place of this subject and serves as the nexus of
the predicates and as the subject supporting them. This second subject means to have
done with the        first subject and to return into itself beyond it. But since the                   first
subject enters into the determinations themselves and is their soul, the second
subject, namely the knowing subject, still finds it there in the predicate, and instead
of being able to be the driving force in the movement of the predicate, deciding by
ratiocination whether this or that predicate is to be ascribed to the first subject, it still
has to deal with the Self of the content, is supposed to cooperate with it instead of
being for itself.1
    ¶61. What we have said can be formally expressed like this: the nature of the
judgement or proposition in general, which involves the distinction of subject and
predicate, is destroyed by the speculative proposition, and the identical proposition
which the former becomes contains the counter-thrust against the subject-predicate
relationship.—This conflict between the form of a proposition in general and the
unity of the concept which destroys it resembles the conflict that occurs in rhythm
between metre and accent. Rhythm results from the                              floating centre and the
---
                                                                                                    

unification of the two. So, too, in the philosophical proposition the identity of subject
and predicate is not supposed to destroy the difference between them, which the
form of the proposition expresses; their unity, rather, is supposed to emerge as a
harmony. The form of the proposition is the appearance of the determinate sense,
or the accent that distinguishes its fulfilment; but the fact that the predicate expresses
the substance, and that the subject itself falls into the universal, is the unity in which
the accent dies away.1
    ¶62. Some examples will clarify what we have said. In the proposition God is Being,
the predicate is      Being; it has a substantial meaning in which the subject dissolves.
Being is here supposed to be not a predicate, but the essence; because of this, God
seems to cease to be that which he is in virtue of the structure of the proposition, viz.
the   fixed subject.—Instead of making headway in the transition from subject to
predicate, thinking feels impeded by the loss of the subject and, because it misses
it, is thrown back onto the thought of the subject; or, since the predicate itself is
expressed as a subject, as the           Being, as the     essence    that exhausts the nature of the
subject, thinking finds the subject immediately in the predicate too; and now, instead
of entering into itself in the predicate and maintaining the free position of ratiocin-
ation, it is still absorbed in the content, or is at least faced with the requirement to be
absorbed in it.—So, too, when one says: the                  Actual is the     Universal, the Actual as
subject disappears in its predicate. The Universal is not supposed to have only the
meaning of a predicate, in which case the proposition would assert that the Actual is
universal; on the contrary, the Universal is supposed to express the essence of the
Actual.—Thinking therefore loses the                  firm objective basis it had in the subject
inasmuch as, in the predicate, it is thrown back onto the subject, and, in the predicate,
it does not return into itself, but into the subject of the content.1
    ¶63. This unaccustomed inhibition is in large measure the source of the com-
plaints about the unintelligibility of philosophical writings, when apart from that the
other cultural requirements for understanding them are present in the individual. In
what we have said we see the reason for the entirely determinate reproach often made
against philosophical works: that so much has to be read repeatedly before it can be
understood—a reproach whose burden is supposed to be so outrageous and                                   final
that, if well founded, it admits of no rejoinder.—It is clear from the above what the
situation is. The philosophical proposition, since it is a proposition, evokes the
opinion that the ordinary relationship between subject and predicate and the usual
attitude of knowledge obtain. The philosophical content of the proposition destroys
this attitude and the opinion about it; the opinion learns by experience that the
meaning is otherwise than it opined; and this correction of its opinion compels
knowledge to go back to the proposition and now take it in another way.1
    ¶64. A difficulty that should be avoided comes from mixing together the specu-
lative mode and the ratiocinative mode, when what is said of the subject at one time
has the meaning of its concept, while at another time it has only the meaning of its
predicate or accidental property.—The one mode interferes with the other, and only
a philosophical exposition of the sort that strictly excluded the ordinary type of
relationship between the parts of a proposition would attain plasticity.1
    ¶65. In fact non-speculative thinking has its right, which is valid, but disregarded
in the mode of the speculative proposition. The sublation of the form of the
---

proposition must not take place only in an immediate manner, not through the mere
content of the proposition. Rather, this opposite movement must be expressed; it must
not just be that internal inhibition, but rather this return of the concept into itself must
be presented. This movement, which constitutes what proof was formerly supposed to
accomplish, is the dialectical movement of the proposition itself. This movement
alone is the actual speculative, and only the expression of this movement is speculative
presentation. As a proposition, the speculative is only the internal inhibition and the
return of the essence into itself, but a return lacking Being-there. Hence we often see
ourselves referred by philosophical expositions to this inner intuition, and in this way
what we required, the presentation of the dialectical movement of the proposition, is
withheld.—The proposition is supposed to express what the true is; but essentially the
true is subject; as such it is just the dialectical movement, this procession that
generates itself, steers its own course, and returns into itself.—In the other sort of
cognition proof constitutes this aspect, the expressed inwardness. But once the
dialectic has been separated from proof, the concept of philosophical demonstration
has in fact been lost.1
    ¶66. On this score it can be pointed out that the dialectical movement likewise has
propositions for its parts or elements; the difficulty indicated seems, therefore, always
to recur and to be a difficulty of the Thing itself.—This is like what happens in
ordinary proof, where the grounds that it uses themselves again need grounding, and
so on ad infinitum. But this form of grounding and conditioning belongs to the sort
of demonstration that is different from the dialectical movement and so belongs to
external cognition. As regards the dialectical movement itself, its element is the pure
concept; it thus has a content which is, in its own self, subject through and through.
Thus no content occurs which functions as an underlying subject, and whose
meaning is assigned to it as a predicate; the proposition is immediately just an
empty form.—Apart from the sensorily intuited or represented Self, it is mainly the
name as name that designates the pure subject, the empty unconceptual One. For this
reason it can be useful, e.g., to avoid the name God, since this word is not immedi-
ately at the same time a concept, but rather the authentic name, the steady repose of
the underlying subject; whereas e.g., Being or the One, singularity, the subject, etc.
themselves immediately indicate concepts as well.—Even if speculative truths are said
of this subject, all the same their content lacks the immanent concept, because this
content is present as a static subject, and through this circumstance such truths
readily assume the form of mere edification.—From this side, too, the obstacle that
arises from the habit of conceiving the speculative predicate according to the form of
a proposition, and not as concept and essence, can be increased or diminished on the
responsibility of the philosophical presentation itself. The presentation must, faithful
to the insight into the nature of the speculative, retain the dialectical form and accept
nothing except insofar as it is conceptualized and is the concept.1
    ¶67. If the ratiocinative attitude is a hindrance to the study of philosophy,
the conceit that       flaunts settled truths without any ratiocination is no less so. The
possessor of such truths sees no need to come back to them; he makes them the
foundation and believes he can not only express them, but also judge and dispute by
means of them. In view of this, it is particularly necessary that philosophizing should
be made a serious business again. In the case of all sciences, arts, skills, and crafts,

people are convinced that a complex and laborious programme of learning and
practice is necessary for competence. Yet when it comes to philosophy, it seems
that the dominant prejudice is now that, although not everyone who has eyes and
fingers, and gets leather and a tool, is thereby in a position to make shoes, everyone
nevertheless immediately understands how to philosophize, and how to evaluate
philosophy, since he possesses the yardstick for it in his natural reason—as if he did
not equally possess the measure of a shoe in his own foot.—It seems that philosoph-
ical competence is made to consist precisely in lack of information and study, as
though philosophy left off where they begin. Philosophy is often regarded as a formal
kind of knowledge, void of content, and the insight is sorely lacking that, whatever
truth there may be in the content of any discipline or science, it can only deserve the
name if it has been engendered by philosophy; that the other sciences can try their
hand as much as they like at ratiocination without philosophy, but without it they can
have in them neither life, nor spirit, nor truth.1
   ¶68. As for genuine philosophy, it lies at the end of a long journey of education, a
movement as rich as it is profound, through which spirit arrives at knowledge.
Instead of this we see sound common sense, which has never exerted or educated
itself with genuine philosophy or other knowledge, and the immediate revelation of
the divine, considering themselves a perfect equivalent of this journey and as good a
substitute for it as chicory is reputed to be for coffee. It is not pleasant to observe that
ignorance and the crudity without form or taste, that cannot itself focus its thinking
on a single abstract proposition, still less on the connection of several propositions,
sometimes claims to be freedom and tolerance of thinking, sometimes even genius.
Genius, as we know, was once all the rage in poetry, as it now is in philosophy; but
when the production of this genius made any sense, instead of poetry it generated
trivial prose or, if it went beyond that, deranged speeches. Similarly nowadays a
natural way of philosophizing, which regards itself as too good for the concept and as
being, because of its lack of the concept, an intuitive and poetic type of thinking,
brings to market the wilful combinations of an imagination that has only been
disorganized by thought,—creations that are neither
nor philosophy.1                                                        fish nor fowl, neither poetry
   ¶69. On the other hand, when natural philosophizing                         flows along the calmer
channel of sound common sense, it offers at best a rhetoric of trivial truths. If
reproached with the insignificance of these truths, it assures us in response that
their sense and fulfilment reside in its heart, and so must be present in the hearts of
others too, since in general it thinks that with the innocence of the heart and the
purity of conscience and the like it has said the last word, to which no objection can
be raised, and beyond which nothing more can be demanded. But the point was this:
that the best should not remain behind in the interior, but brought out of this cavern
into the light of day. The effort of advancing ultimate truths of that kind could have
been avoided long ago; for they have long since been available in the catechism, in
popular proverbs, and so on.—It is not difficult to spot the indeterminacy or
contortion in such truths, often it is easy to disclose the opposite truths to the
consciousness of them within that self-same consciousness. When it struggles to
extricate itself from the confusion induced in it, consciousness will fall into a new
confusion, and may well resort to the outburst that the case is definitively such and
---
    

such, and all the rest is sophistries—a catch phrase of ordinary common sense against
cultivated reason, just as ignorance of philosophy has adopted the expression day-
dreaming to brand it once and for all.—Since common sense appeals to feeling, to its
internal oracle, it has nothing to do with anyone who does not agree; it must explain
that it has nothing more to say to anyone who does not                       find and feel the same in
himself;—in other words, it tramples underfoot the root of humanity. For it is the
nature of humanity to press for agreement with others, and its existence resides only
in the achieved community of consciousnesses. The anti-human, the bestial, consists
in confinement to feeling, and in being able to communicate only by this means. 1
   ¶70. If anyone were to ask for a royal road to science, 1 no more convenient route
can be suggested than to rely on sound common sense and also, incidentally, for the
purpose of keeping abreast of the times and philosophy, to read reviews of philo-
sophical works, perhaps even their prefaces and opening paragraphs; for the latter
give the general principles on which everything depends, and reviews give, besides
the historical summary, the assessment too, which, being an assessment, stands above
the object assessed. One follows this common route in casual dress; but the exalted
feeling of the eternal, the holy, the infinite strides along in the robes of a high priest—
on a route that is rather already itself the immediate Being in the centre, the genius of
profound original Ideas and exalted                 flashes of thought. However, just as such
profundity does not yet reveal the source of the essence, so too these pyrotechnics
are not yet the empyrean.2 True thoughts and scientific insight are to be won only in
the labour of the concept. The concept alone can produce the universality of
knowledge that is not the ordinary indeterminacy and poverty of ordinary common
sense, but cultivated and completed cognition; nor is it the extraordinary universality
of the gift of reason corrupting itself by indolence and conceit of genius, but the
truth matured to its natural form,—a truth capable of being the property of all self-
conscious reason.3
   ¶71. I locate that by which science exists in the self-movement of the concept. But
the ideas of our time about the nature and shape of truth diverge from this position,
both in the ways cited above and in other superficial respects; in fact they are entirely
at odds with it. This consideration promises, it seems, no favourable reception for an
attempt to present the system of science in this determination. Meanwhile I can
reflect that if, for example, at times the excellence of Plato’s philosophy is located in
his scientifically worthless myths, there have also been times, even called times of
enthusiasm, when Aristotle’s philosophy was esteemed for its speculative depth, and
Plato’s   Parmenides       (surely the greatest work of art of the ancient                   dialectic) was
regarded as the true disclosure and                 positive expression of the divine life, times
when, even with all the obscurity generated by
was in fact supposed to be nothing other than the pure concept.1 I reflect too that theecstasy, this misunderstood ecstasy
excellence in the philosophy of our time locates its own value in its scientific
character, and even if the others take it in another way, it is in fact only by its
scientific character that it makes its mark. And so I too can hope that this attempt to
vindicate science for the concept, and to present it in this its peculiar element, will
know how to make its way by the inner truth of the Thing itself. We must remain
convinced that it is the nature of the true to win through when its time has come, and
that   it  appears      only    when     its  time    has    come,     and   therefore      never    appears

prematurely, nor finds a public unripe for receiving it; we must also be convinced that
the individual needs this effect in order to confirm what is as yet a Thing for himself
alone, and to experience as something universal the conviction which at first belongs
only to particularity. But in this connection the public must often be distinguished
from those who behave as its representatives and spokesmen. In many respects the
attitude of the public is quite different from, even contrary to, that of these spokes-
men. Whereas the public good-naturedly prefers to blame itself when a philosophical
work does not appeal to it, these others, by contrast, certain of their competence, put
all blame on the author. The effect on the public is quieter than the activity of these
dead when they bury their dead.2                 In general our insight now is altogether more
cultivated, its curiosity more alert, and its judgement more swiftly formed, so that the
feet of those who will carry you out are already at the door.3 But from this we must
often distinguish the slower effect which rectifies the attention extorted by impressive
assurances and corrects contemptuous censure, and gives some a place in the world
of today only after a time, while others after a time have no place in the world of
tomorrow.
    ¶72. Incidentally, at a time when the universality of spirit has grown so much
stronger and singularity, as is           fitting, has become correspondingly less important,
when, too, universality claims and holds on to its whole range and cultivated wealth,
the share in the total work of spirit that falls to the activity of the individual can only
be small. Because of this, the individual must all the more forget himself, as the
nature of science in any case requires. Of course, he must become and do what he
can; but less must be demanded of him, just as he in turn can expect less of himself,
and may demand less for himself.1

         Introduction

¶73. It is a natural idea that in philosophy, before we come to deal with the Thing
itself, namely with the actual cognition of what in truth is, it is necessary first to come
to an understanding about cognition, which is regarded as the instrument by which
we take possession of the absolute, or as the medium through which we catch sight
of it. The concern seems justified, on the one hand that there may be various kinds
of cognition, and one of them might be handier than another for the attainment of
this goal, and so by a wrong choice among them,1—and on the other hand that, since
cognition is a capacity of a determinate kind and scope, without a more precise
determination of its nature and limits, we shall get hold of clouds of error instead of
the heaven of truth. What is more, this concern must surely turn into the conviction
that the whole enterprise of securing for consciousness that which is in itself through
cognition is absurd in its concept, and that between cognition and the absolute there
lies a boundary that completely divides them. For, if cognition is the instrument for
gaining possession of the absolute essence, it is immediately obvious that the appli-
cation of an instrument to a Thing does not in fact leave it as it is for itself, but rather
effects a forming and alteration of it. Or if cognition is not an instrument of our
activity but a sort of passive medium through which the light of truth reaches us, then
again we do not receive the truth as it is in itself, but only as it is through and in this
medium. In both cases we use a means which immediately brings about the opposite
of its intended aim; or what is really absurd is that we make use of a means at all. It
seems, no doubt, that this drawback can be remedied through an acquaintance with
the way in which the instrument works; for this enables us to subtract from the result
the instrument’s own contribution to the representation of the absolute which we
gain by its means, and so to get the true in its purity. But this improvement would
in fact only bring us back to where we were before. If from a thing we have formed
we take away again what the instrument has done to it, then the thing—here the
absolute—is for us exactly what it was before this now superfluous effort. If the
instrument is supposed merely to bring the absolute a little closer to us, without
altering anything in it, like a bird caught by a lime-twig, it would surely deride this
ruse, if it were not in and for itself already with us and willing to be so; for in this case
cognition would be a ruse, since by its complex endeavour it assumes the air of doing
something quite different from simply establishing an immediate and thus effortless
relation. Or if an examination of cognition, which we represent as a medium, acquaints
us with the law of its refraction, it is again useless to subtract the refraction from the
result; for cognition is not the refraction of the ray, but the ray itself by which truth
reaches us, and if this were subtracted, only the pure direction or blank space would
have been indicated to us.2

    ¶74. Meanwhile, if concern about falling into error injects a mistrust into science,
which without any such misgivings gets on with the job itself and actually cognizes, it
is hard to see why we should not, conversely, inject a mistrust into this mistrust and
be concerned that this fear of erring is really the error itself. In fact this fear
presupposes something, a great deal in fact, as truth, and it supports its misgivings
and inferences on what itself needs to be examined first to see if it is truth. That is to
say, it presupposes representations of cognition as an instrument and medium, also a
distinction between ourselves and this cognition; but above all, it presupposes that the
absolute stands on one side and cognition on the other side, for itself and separated
from the absolute, and yet is something real or, to put it bluntly, it presupposes that
cognition which, since it is outside the absolute, is surely outside the truth as well, is
nevertheless genuine, an assumption whereby what calls itself fear of error stands
exposed rather as fear of truth.1
    ¶75. This conclusion stems from the fact that the absolute alone is true, or the true
alone is absolute. The conclusion can be rejected by drawing a distinction: a cognition
that does not cognize the absolute, as science aims to, can nevertheless be true as well,
and cognition in general, though it may be incapable of grasping the absolute, can
still be capable of some other truth. But we gradually come to see that beating about
the bush in this way comes down to a murky distinction between an absolutely true
and some other kind of true, and that the absolute, cognition, etc. are words that
presuppose a meaning that first needs to be ascertained. 1
    ¶76. There is an alternative to tormenting ourselves with such useless ideas and
stock phrases about cognition as an instrument for getting hold of the absolute, or as
a medium through which we catch sight of the truth—and surely all these ideas of a
cognition separated from the absolute, and an absolute separated from cognition,
amount to those relationships; there is no need to bother with excuses which derive
the incapacity of science from the presupposition of such relationships as these, in
order to free oneself of the toil of science while at the same time assuming the air of
serious and zealous endeavour; nor need we struggle for answers to all this. Instead of
that we could reject them out of hand as contingent and arbitrary representations,
and the associated use of words like the absolute, cognition, as well as the objective
and the subjective and countless others, whose meaning is presupposed as universally
familiar, could even be regarded as a fraud. For the pretence not just that their
meaning is universally familiar, but also that their concept is in one’s own possession,
looks more as if it is supposed to avoid the main Thing, namely, to provide this
concept. On the other hand, we could, with more right, spare ourselves the trouble of
taking any notice at all of such ideas and locutions, with which science itself is
supposed to be kept at bay; for they only amount to an empty appearance of
knowing, which vanishes immediately when science itself comes on the scene. But
science, in virtue of coming on the scene, is itself an appearance; its entrance is not
yet science developed and expanded in its truth. It makes no difference here whether
we suppose that science is the appearance because it comes on the scene along with
something else, or whether we call that other untrue knowledge its appearing. But
science must free itself of this semblance; and it can do this only by turning against it.
For when faced with a sort of knowledge that is not genuine, science can neither just
reject it as a common view of things, claiming that science is an entirely different sort
---
                                                                                       

of cognition for which that other knowledge is of no account whatever; nor can
science appeal to the intimation of something better within this other knowledge. By
that first claim, science would be declaring its Being to be its power; but the untrue
knowledge in turn appeals to the fact that it is, and claims that for it science is of no
account; one bare claim is worth just as much as another. Still less can science appeal
to the better intimation supposedly present in the cognition that is not genuine, to the
sign within it pointing towards science; because, for one thing, it would similarly be
appealing again to a Being; but, for another thing, it would be appealing to itself in
the mode in which it is present in the non-genuine cognition, that is, it would be
appealing to an inferior mode of its Being and to its appearance rather than to how it
is in and for itself. It is for this reason that the presentation of knowledge as it appears
is to be undertaken here.1
    ¶77. Now because it has for its object only knowledge as it appears, this presen-
tation itself seems not to be the free science, moving in its own peculiar shape; rather,
from this standpoint it can be regarded as the path of the natural consciousness
pressing on to true knowledge, or as the way of the soul passing through the sequence
of its configurations as stations prescribed for it by its own nature, so that it may
purify itself to spirit and, through the complete experience of itself, arrive at the
awareness of what it is in itself.1
    ¶78. Natural consciousness will prove to be only the concept of knowledge, or
knowledge that is not real. But natural consciousness immediately takes itself to be
real knowledge, and so this path has a negative meaning for it, and it counts what is in
fact the realization of the concept as the loss of its own self; for on this path it loses its
truth. The path can therefore be regarded as the way of doubt, or more precisely as
the way of despair; for what happens on this path is not what is usually understood by
doubting, shaking some supposed truth or other, followed by a convenient dis-
appearance of the doubt and a return to that truth again, so that in the end the
Thing is taken as it was in the first place. On the contrary, this path is the conscious
insight into the untruth of knowledge as it appears, for which the supreme reality is
what is in truth only the unrealized concept. That is why this self-accomplishing
scepticism is also not the accoutrement with which the earnest zeal for truth and
science fancies it has prepared and equipped itself in their service: with the resolution,
namely, never in science to surrender upon authority to the thoughts of others, but to
examine everything oneself and to follow only one’s own conviction, or better still, to
produce everything oneself and to regard only one’s own deed as the true. The series
of configurations which consciousness goes through on this path is rather the
detailed history of the         education     of consciousness itself to science. That resolution
represents education as immediately over and done with, as a past happening, in the
simple manner of the resolution; but in contrast to this untruth, this path is the actual
performance. To follow one’s own conviction is admittedly more than submitting to
authority; but the conversion of a belief based on authority into a belief from personal
conviction does not necessarily alter the content of the belief or replace error with
truth. Involvement in a system of opinion and prejudice on the authority of others
and involvement in it from personal conviction differ only in respect of the vanity
that goes with the latter policy. By contrast, the scepticism that is directed at the
whole range of consciousness as it appears is what first gives spirit the capacity to
---
     

investigate what the truth is. For it gives rise to a despair in the so-called natural
ideas, thoughts, and opinions—no matter whether they are called one’s own or
someone else’s—whereas the consciousness that gets down to its investigation right
away     is still  filled and encumbered with them, but because of that it is in fact
incapable of the task it proposes to undertake.1
    ¶79. The completeness of the forms of the consciousness that is not real will result
from the necessity of the progression and interconnection itself. To make this
comprehensible, we can in advance make the general remark that the presentation
in its untruth of the consciousness that is not genuine is not a merely                              negative
movement. This is a one-sided view such as the natural consciousness generally
has of it; and a knowledge which makes this one-sidedness into its essence is one of
the shapes of unfinished consciousness; it occurs in the course of the journey itself
and will present itself there. To be precise, this is the scepticism that only ever sees
pure nothing in the result and abstracts from the fact that this nothing is determin-
ately the nothing of that from which it results. But the genuine result is in fact only the
nothing taken as the result of that from which it derives; and so the nothing is itself a
determinate nothing and has a content. The scepticism that ends up with the abstrac-
tion of nothing or with emptiness cannot go any further from there, but must wait
to see whether anything new presents itself and, if so, what it is, in order to cast it into
the same empty abyss. When, on the other hand, the result is conceived as it is in truth,
as determinate negation, then a new form has thereby immediately arisen, and in the
negation the transition is made by which the advance through the complete series of
shapes ensues of itself.1
    ¶80. But the goal is fixed for knowledge just as necessarily as the sequence of the
advance; it is situated where knowledge no longer needs to go beyond itself, where
knowledge       finds itself, and the concept corresponds to the object and the object to
the concept. So the advance towards this goal is also relentless, and no satisfaction is
to be found at any earlier station. Whatever is limited to a natural life cannot of its
own accord go beyond its immediate Being-there; but it is driven beyond it by
something else, and this uprootedness is its death. But consciousness is for itself its
own    concept, thereby immediately the advance beyond what is limited and, since
what is thus limited belongs to it, beyond itself; together with the singular the beyond
is also posited for consciousness, even if only                  alongside    the limited, as in spatial
intuition. Thus consciousness suffers this violence at its own hands: it spoils its own
limited satisfaction. On feeling this violence, anxiety may well draw back before the
truth, and strive to maintain what it is in danger of losing. But this anxiety can find
no rest, unless it wishes to remain in thoughtless indolence; thought spoils thought-
lessness and its restlessness disturbs indolence; or unless it entrenches itself as
sentimentality, which claims to find everything good of its kind; this claim likewise
suffers violence at the hands of reason, which                   finds something no good precisely
insofar as it is a kind. Or fear of the truth may hide from itself and others behind the
illusion that its burning zeal for truth is precisely what makes it so difficult, even
impossible, for it to       find any other truth but the sole truth of vanity—that one is
always even cleverer than any thoughts one draws out of oneself or from others; this
vanity which understands how to vaporize any truth, understands how to return
from it into itself and revels in its own understanding, which knows how to dissolve

every thought and to find the barren I instead of any content, is a gratification which
must be left to itself; for it flees from the universal and seeks only Being-for-itself.1
    ¶81. After these preliminary general comments about the manner and necessity
of the progression, it may be similarly useful to add a remark about the                           method of
carrying it out. This exposition is presented as a response of science to knowledge as
it appears, and as an         investigation and       examination of the reality of cognition; and
so it seems as if it cannot take place without some presupposition which is adopted
as a   standard     underlying it. For an examination consists in the application of an
accepted standard, and the decision whether what is being examined is correct or
incorrect depends on the resulting agreement or disagreement of it with the standard;
and the standard in general, and science too if that happens to be the standard, is
thereby accepted as the essence or as the in-itself. But here, where science first comes
on the scene, neither science itself nor anything else has justified itself as the essence
or as the in-itself; and without something of the sort it seems that no examination can
take place.1
    ¶82. This contradiction and its removal will emerge more determinately if we
first recall the abstract determinations of knowledge and of truth as they occur in
consciousness. To be precise, consciousness                  distinguishes from itself something to
which it at the same time relates itself; or, as the expression goes, there is something
for consciousness; and this determinate aspect, the relating, or the Being of something
for a consciousness, is knowing. But from this Being for another we distinguish Being-
in-itself; what is related to knowing is also distinguished from knowing and posited as
being outside this relation as well; this aspect, the in-itself, is called truth. What is
really involved in these determinations is of no further concern to us here; for as our
object is knowledge as it appears, so too its determinations are initially taken up as
they immediately present themselves; and they present themselves very much as we
have conceived them.1
    ¶83. If we now investigate the truth of knowledge, then it seems that we are
investigating what knowledge is in itself. Yet in this investigation knowledge is our
object, it is    for us; and the       in-itself  of knowledge that emerged from the inquiry
would thus be rather its Being for us; what we claimed to be its essence would not
be its truth but only our knowledge of it. The essence or standard would lie within
ourselves, and that which is supposed to be compared with it and about which a
decision should be taken in light of this comparison would not necessarily have to
recognize the standard.1
    ¶84. But the nature of the object we are investigating avoids this separation or this
semblance of separation and presupposition. Consciousness provides its standard
within itself, and the investigation will therefore be a comparison of consciousness
with itself; for the distinction that has just been made falls within it. In consciousness
there is one thing for another, or consciousness in general has in it the determinacy
of the moment of knowledge; at the same time, this other is to consciousness not
merely for it, but also outside this relation or in itself: the moment of truth. Thus in
what consciousness declares within itself to be the in-itself                   or the true we have the
standard that consciousness itself sets up by which to measure its knowledge. If we
call knowledge the concept, and call the essence or the true, on the other hand, that
which is or the object, then the examination consists in seeing whether the concept
---
    

corresponds to the object. But if we call the essence or the in-itself of the object the
concept, and conversely understand by the object the object as object, that is, as it is
for an other, then the examination consists in seeing whether the object corres-
ponds to its concept. It is easy to see that these amount to the same thing; but the
essential point to bear in mind throughout the whole investigation is that both
these moments,         concept     and   object,   Being-for-another        and    Being-in-itself, them-
selves fall within the knowledge we are investigating, and consequently we do not
need to import standards, and to apply our notions and thoughts in the investiga-
tion; it is by leaving these aside that we succeed in considering the Thing as it is in
and for itself. 1
   ¶85. So an intervention by us becomes superfluous in this respect, that concept
and object, the standard and what is to be assessed, are present in consciousness itself.
But not only that, we are also spared the trouble of comparing the two and really
assessing them, so that, as consciousness assesses itself, all that remains for us in this
respect too is simply to look on. For consciousness is on the one hand consciousness
of the object, on the other hand consciousness of itself; consciousness of what to it is
the true, and consciousness of its knowledge of the true. Since both are for conscious-
ness, consciousness itself is their comparison; it becomes a matter for consciousness
whether its knowledge of the object corresponds to the object or not. The object,
admittedly, seems to be for consciousness only as consciousness knows it; conscious-
ness seems unable, as it were, to get behind the scenes to see the object not as it is
for consciousness, but as it is in itself, and so unable to assess its knowledge by it.
However, the very fact that consciousness knows of an object at all already involves
this distinction:     to consciousness something is the              in-itself, while another moment
is the knowledge, or the Being of the object for consciousness. This differentiation
is at hand, and the assessment rests upon it. If in this comparison the two do not
correspond, then it seems that consciousness must alter its knowledge to make it
conform to the object; but in the alteration of the knowledge, the object itself alters
for it too, for the existing knowledge was essentially a knowledge of the object: along
with the knowledge the object too becomes another, for it essentially belonged to this
knowledge. Hence consciousness finds that what it previously took to be the in-itself
is not in itself, or that it was in itself only for consciousness. Since consciousness thus
finds in its object that its knowledge is at odds with the object, the object itself does
not hold out either; or the standard of the assessment alters when that of which it
was supposed to be the standard fails the test; and the assessment is not only an
assessment of the knowledge, but also of the standard of the assessment.1
   ¶86. This     dialectical    movement which consciousness exercises on itself, on its
knowledge as well as on its object, insofar as the new, true object emerges from it for
consciousness, is really what is called experience. In this connection there is a moment
in the process just mentioned which needs to be brought out more clearly, and this
will shed a new light on the scientific aspect of the following presentation. Con-
sciousness knows something, this object is the essence or the in-itself; but it is also the
in-itself for consciousness; with this the ambiguity of this truth comes in. We see that
consciousness now has two objects: one is the first in-itself, the second is the Being-
for-consciousness of this in-itself. The latter seems initially to be only the reflection of
consciousness into itself, a representing, not of an object, but only of its knowledge of
---
                                                                                                                                                                                           

that         first object. But as we have shown above, consciousness thereby has its                                                                                                               first
object altered; the object ceases to be the in-itself, and becomes to consciousness an
object that is the in-itself only for consciousness; and so this, the Being-for-conscious-
ness of this in-itself, is then the true, which means, however, that this is the essence or
the object of consciousness. This new object contains the nullity of the first, it is what
experience has made of it.1
      ¶87. In this presentation of the course of experience there is a moment in virtue
of which it does not seem to agree with what is ordinarily understood by experi-
ence. That is, the transition from the                                                                first object and the knowledge of it, to the
other object, with which, as they say, the experience has been had, was specified to
the effect that the knowledge of the first object, or the for-consciousness of the first
in-itself, is itself supposed to become the second object. By contrast, it usually
seems that we gain the experience of the untruth of our first concept with another
object which we come across by chance and externally, so that all in all only the
pure           apprehension                          of what is in and for itself falls to us. In the above view,
however, the new object shows itself to have come about through a                                                                                                                     reversal of
consciousness itself. This view of the Thing is our contribution, in virtue of which
the sequence of consciousness’s experiences is raised to a scientific progression and
which is not for the consciousness that we are considering. But in fact this is the
same circumstance as the one discussed above in connection with the relationship
of our presentation to scepticism, namely that in each case the result emerging in
an untruthful sort of knowledge should not be left to dwindle into an empty
nothing, but must necessarily be conceived as the nothing of that of which it is the
result; a result which contains whatever truth the preceding knowledge has in it.
This presents itself here like this: since what                                                                          first appeared as the object sinks to
consciousness’s knowledge of it, and the in-itself becomes a Being-for-consciousness
of the in-itself, this is the new object, bringing on a new shape of consciousness
too, for which the essence is something different from that of the preceding shape.
It is this circumstance that guides the whole sequence of the shapes of conscious-
ness in their necessity. But it is this necessity itself, or the                                                                                              emergence of the new
object that presents itself to consciousness without its knowing what is happening
to it, that for us, as it were, goes on behind the back of consciousness. There thus
comes into the movement of consciousness a moment of Being-in-itself or Being-
for-us that does not present itself for the consciousness that is comprehended in
the experience itself; but the                                                 content of what we see emerge is for consciousness,
and we comprehend only its formal aspect, or its pure emergence; for consciousness
what has thus emerged is only as object, for us it is at the same time movement and
becoming.1
hence, in keeping with its content, science of the experience of consciousness.1
                                                                                ¶88. In virtue of this necessity, the path to science is itself already                             science         and
      ¶89. The experience which consciousness has of itself can, in accordance with the
concept of experience, comprehend within itself nothing less than the whole system
of consciousness, or the whole realm of the truth of spirit, in such a way that the
moments of this truth present themselves in this peculiar determinacy: they are not
abstract, pure moments, but as they are for consciousness, or as consciousness itself
emerges in its relation to them. This is why the moments of the whole are shapes of

consciousness. In pressing on to its true existence, consciousness will reach a point at
which it sheds its semblance of being burdened with alien material that is only for it
and as an other, a point where the appearance becomes equal to the essence, where
consequently its presentation coincides with just this point in the authentic science of
spirit; and finally, when consciousness itself grasps this its essence, it will signify the
nature of absolute knowledge itself.1

        A. Consciousness

        I. Sensory Certainty: The This and Meaning
¶90. The knowledge that is our object at first or immediately can be nothing other
than that which is itself immediate knowledge, knowledge of the immediate or what
simply is. We have to adopt a similarly immediate or receptive                      approach, and thus
alter nothing in the object as it presents itself, and exclude conceptualization from
apprehension.1
   ¶91. The concrete content of sensory certainty                  makes it immediately appear as
the richest cognition, indeed as a cognition of infinite wealth for which no limit can
be found, whether we proceed outwards in the space and time in which it extends,
or whether we take a piece of this abundance, and proceed inwards by dividing it.
Moreover, sensory certainty appears as the most genuine                       cognition; for it has not
as yet omitted anything from the object, but has it before itself in its entirety. But
in fact this    certainty exposes itself as the most abstract and poorest truth. This is
all it says about what it knows: ‘it is’; and its truth contains only the                     Being of the
Thing. Consciousness, for its part, is in this certainty only as pure                       I; or I am in
this certainty only as pure This, and the object similarly only as pure                        This. I, this
I, am certain of this Thing, not because I, as consciousness, have developed myself
in the process or set thought in multifarious motion. And not because                            the Thing
of which I am certain, is, in virtue of a host of distinct qualities, a rich complex of
connections within itself, or a variety of relationships to other things. Neither of
these has anything to do with the truth of sensory certainty. In this case neither
I nor the Thing has the significance of a complex mediation: the I does not have
the significance of a manifold representing or thinking; nor does the Thing
have the significance of manifold qualities: no, the Thing is, and it is, only because
it is. It is—this is what is essential for sensory knowledge, and this pure                       Being, or
this simple immediacy, constitutes its truth. In the same way, certainty as a relation is
an immediate pure relation: consciousness is I, nothing more, a pure This; the singleton
knows the pure This, or the singular.1
   ¶92. But in this       pure Being, which constitutes the essence of this certainty, and
which this certainty claims to be its truth, much more comes into play, if we look. An
actual sensory certainty is not just this pure immediacy, but an exemplifying by-play
of it. 1 Among the countless differences occurring here we find in every case a crucial
difference, namely that in sensory certainty the two This’s already mentioned, a This as
I, and a This as object, issue directly from the pure Being. If we reflect on this difference,
it emerges that neither the one nor the other is present in sensory certainty only
immediately; at the same time they are present as mediated: I have the certainty through
---

something else, viz. the Thing; and similarly the Thing is in the certainty                            through
something else, viz. through the I.2
   ¶93. It is not just we who draw this distinction between the essence and the byplay,
between immediacy and mediation; we                    find it in sensory certainty itself, and the
distinction is to be taken up in the form it has in sensory certainty, not as we
determined it just now. One element in sensory certainty is posited as the simple,
immediate being, or as the essence,              the object, while the other is posited as what is
unessential and mediated, something that in sensory certainty is through an other,
not  in itself, the I,    a knowledge that knows the object only because the object is, a
knowledge that may either be or not be. But the object is, it is the true and the essence;
it is, no matter whether it is known or not; it remains, even if it is not known; but the
knowledge is not if the object is not.1
   ¶94. So the object needs to be considered, to see whether in sensory certainty itself
the object is in fact the kind of essence that sensory certainty presents it as; whether this
concept of it as the essence corresponds to the way in which it is present in sensory
certainty. To this end, we need not reflect on the object and ponder what it might be
in truth; we need only consider the way in which it is present in sensory certainty.
   ¶95. So we have to put the question to sensory certainty itself: What is the This?
If we take the This in the twofold shape of its Being, as the Now and as the Here, the
dialectic it has in it will receive a form as intelligible as the This itself is. To the
question: What is the Now? we answer, for example: The Now is the night. In order to
test the truth of this sensory certainty a simple experiment suffices. We write down
this truth; a truth cannot lose anything by being written down, nor can it lose
anything through our preserving it. If now, this noon, we look again at the written
truth we shall have to say that it has become stale.1
   ¶96. The Now that is night is preserved, i.e. it is treated as what it is made out to be,
as a being; but it turns out to be, on the contrary, a non-being. The Now itself does
indeed maintain itself, but as a Now that is not night; equally, it maintains itself
against the day that it now is, as a Now that is also not day, or as a negative in general.
This self-maintaining Now is, therefore, not an immediate Now but a mediated Now;
for it is determined as a permanent and self-maintaining Now by the very fact that
something else, viz. the day and the night, is not. For all that, it is still just as simple as
before, Now, and in this simplicity it is indifferent to what is still in play by its side;
the night and the day are definitely not its Being, but it is also day and night
nonetheless; it is not in the least affected by this its other-being. A simple thing of
this kind, which is through negation, neither This nor That, a not-This, and equally
indifferent to being This as well as That—we call it a universal. So in fact the universal
is the true of sensory certainty.1
   ¶97. It is also as a universal that we express the sensory. What we say is: This, i.e.
the  universal This,      or: it is, i.e.  Being in general. Of course, in doing so we do not
represent    to ourselves the universal This or Being in general, but we                          express    the
universal; or our speech does not strictly express what we                         mean      in this sensory
certainty. But language, as we see, is the more truthful; in it, we ourselves immediately
refute our     meaning, and since the universal is the true of sensory certainty and
language expresses this true alone, it is just not possible for us ever to say a sensory
Being that we mean. 1

    ¶98. The same will be the case with the other form of the This, with the Here. The
Here is, e.g., the tree. If I turn round, this truth has disappeared and is converted into
the opposite truth: The Here is not a tree, but a house instead. The Here itself does not
disappear; no, it is,      enduring in the disappearance of the house, the tree, etc., and
indifferent to whether it is house or tree. Again, then, the                     This shows itself to be
mediated simplicity, or universality.1
    ¶99. This sensory certainty shows, within its own self, the universal to be the truth
of its object.     Pure being      remains, then, as the essence of sensory certainty, not
however as something immediate, but as something to which negation and medi-
ation are essential; consequently, it is not what we mean by Being, but Being with the
determination that it is the abstraction, or the purely universal; and our meaning, for
which the true of sensory certainty is not the universal, is all that still remains in the
face of this empty or indifferent Now and Here.1
    ¶100. If we compare the relationship in which knowing and the object first came on
the scene, with the relationship in which they come to stand in this result, we find
that it is reversed. The object, which was supposed to be the essential element, is now
the inessential element in sensory certainty; for the universal which the object has
come to be is no longer what the object was supposed to be essentially for sensory
certainty. On the contrary, sensory certainty is now located in the opposite, viz. in
knowledge, which previously was the inessential element. Its truth is in the object as
my object, or in my meaning; it is, because I have knowledge of it. Sensory certainty,
then, is indeed expelled from the object, but it is not yet sublated by this, but only
driven back into the I. We now have to see what experience shows us about this
reality of sensory certainty.1
    ¶101. So the force of the truth of sense certainty now lies in the I, in the immediacy
of my seeing, hearing, and so on; the disappearance of the singular Now and Here
that we mean is prevented because I hold them fast. The Now is day, because I see
daylight;    the Here is a tree, for the same reason. But in this relationship sensory
certainty experiences the same dialectic within itself as in the previous relationship. I,
this I, see the tree and affirm the tree as the Here; but another I sees the house and
maintains that Here is not a tree but a house instead. Both truths have the same
authentication, viz. the immediacy of seeing, and the security and assurance of both
about their knowledge; but the one truth vanishes in the other.1
    ¶102. What does not disappear in all this is                    I, as   universal, whose seeing is
neither a seeing of the tree nor of this house, but a simple seeing which, though
mediated by the negation of this house, etc., is equally simple and indifferent to
what is still in play beside it, to the house, the tree. I is only universal like                        Now,
Here, or This in general; I do indeed mean a singular I, but I can no more say what
I mean in the case of I than I can in the case of Now and Here. When I say this
Here, Now, or a singular, I am saying all This’s, all Heres, Nows, singulars. Similarly,
when I say I, this singular I, I say in general all                I’s; what I say is everyone: I, this
singular I. When science is presented with the challenge, as if it were the acid test
it simply could not withstand—to deduce, construct,                       find a priori, or however it
is expressed, a so-called          this thing     or  a this man, it is only reasonable that the
challenge should say which this thing, or which this I it means; but it is impossible
to say this.1

    ¶103. So sensory certainty learns by experience that its essence is neither in the
object nor in the I, and that the immediacy is neither an immediacy of the one nor of
the other; for in both, what I mean is rather an inessential, and the object and I are
universals in which that Now and Here and I which I mean does not have a
continuing subsistence, or is not. In this way we come to the point where we posit
the   whole    of sensory certainty itself as its          essence, and no longer only one of its
moments, as happened in the two cases where first the object confronting the I, and
then the I, was supposed to be its reality. Thus it is only sensory certainty as a whole
which stands firm within itself as immediacy and by so doing excludes from itself all
the opposition that occurred before.1
    ¶104. This pure immediacy therefore no longer has any concern with the
otherness of the Here as a tree which passes over into a Here that is a non-tree,
or with the otherness of the Now as day which passes over into a Now that is night,
or with another I with another object. Its truth maintains itself as a relation that
remains equal to itself, and which makes no distinction between the I and the object
with regard to what is essential and what is unessential, and so no distinction at all
can penetrate into it either. So I, this I, affirm the Here as a tree, and do not turn
round so that the Here becomes for me a non-tree; and I take no notice of the fact
that another I sees the Here as non-tree, or that I myself at another time take the
Here as non-tree, the Now as non-day. No, I am pure intuiting; I stick to my claim
that the Now is day, or alternatively that the Here is a tree; and I do not compare the
Here and Now themselves with each other, but stick firmly to one immediate relation:
the Now is day.1
    ¶105. Since, then, this certainty now refuses to come forth when we draw its
attention to a Now that is night, or to an I for whom it is night, we go up to it and let
the Now that is affirmed be pointed out to us. We must let it be pointed out to us; for
the truth of this immediate relation is the truth of this I which confines itself to one
Now or one Here. Were we to take up this truth                     afterwards, or stand at a distance
from it, it would have no significance at all; for we would sublate the immediacy that
is essential to it. We must therefore enter into the same point of time or space, let
them be pointed out to us, i.e. let ourselves be made into the very same this I which is
the one that knows with certainty. Let us, then, see how the immediate, that is pointed
out to us, is constituted.1
    ¶106. The Now is pointed out, this Now. Now; it has already ceased to be when it is
pointed out. The Now that is, is another Now than the one pointed out, and we see
that the Now is just this: already to be no more when it is. The Now, as it is pointed
out to us, is a Now that has been, and this is its truth; it has not the truth of Being. So
this much is true after all, that it has been. But what has been, an ex-entity, is, in fact,
no essence, no entity; it is not, and we were concerned with Being. 1
    ¶107. In this pointing-out, then, we see only a movement which takes the
following course: (1) I point out the Now, it is affirmed as the true; but I point it
out as a has-been, or as something sublated, I sublate the first truth. (2) Now I affirm
as the second truth that it has been, is sublated. (3) But what has been, is not; I sublate
the having-been-ness or sublatedness, the second truth, and thereby negate the
negation of the Now, and thus return to the                     first affirmation, that        Now    is. The
Now, and pointing out the Now, are thus so constituted that neither the Now nor

the pointing out is immediately simple, but a movement which has various moments
in it: a This is posited, but it is rather an other that is posited, or the This is sublated:
and this otherness, or sublation of the first, is itself again sublated, and so has returned
to the first. However, this first, reflected into itself, is not exactly the same as it was to
begin with, viz. something immediate; on the contrary, it is something reflected into
itself, or simple which, in its otherness, remains what it is: a Now which is absolutely
many Nows. And this is the veritable Now, the Now as simple day which has within it
many Nows, hours. Such a Now, an hour, is similarly many minutes, and this Now is
likewise many Nows, and so on.—The pointing-out is thus itself the movement which
expresses what the Now is in truth, viz. a result, or a plurality of Nows all taken
together; and the pointing-out is the experience of learning that Now is a universal. 1
    ¶108. The Here pointed out, which I hold fast, is similarly a this Here, which in fact
is not this Here, but a Before and Behind, an Above and Below, a Right and Left. The
Above is itself similarly this manifold otherness of above, below, etc. The Here, which
was supposed to be pointed out, vanishes in other Heres, but these likewise vanish.
What is pointed out, held fast, and remains, is a negative This, which is                           thus only
when the Heres        are taken as they are supposed to be, but sublate themselves in the
process; it is a simple complex of many Heres. The Here that is meant would be the
point; but the point is not: on the contrary, when it is pointed out as something that
is, the pointing-out shows itself to be not immediate knowledge, but a movement
from the Here that is meant through many Heres into the universal Here, which is a
simple plurality of Heres, just as the day is a simple plurality of Nows.1
    ¶109. It is clear that the dialectic of sensory certainty is nothing other than the
simple history of its movement or of its experience, and sensory certainty itself is
nothing other than this history only. That is why the natural consciousness itself also
always advances to this result, which is the true in sensory certainty, and it gains
experience of it; but equally it only forgets it again and again, and begins the
movement afresh. It is therefore astonishing when, in the face of this experience,
it is proposed as universal experience, also as a philosophical assertion, and even as
the result of scepticism, that the reality or the Being of external things as these things,
or sensory things, has absolute truth for consciousness. Such an assertion does not
even know what it is talking about, does not know that it is saying the opposite of
what it wants to say. The truth for consciousness of the sensory This is supposed to be
universal experience; but the contrary is universal experience. Every consciousness
itself sublates again such a truth as e.g.            the Here is a tree, or, the Now is noon, and
expresses the contrary: the Here is not a tree, but rather a house; and insofar as this
second assertion, sublating the first, again involves such an assertion of a sensory
This, it instantly sublates that too. And in all sensory certainty only what we have
seen is experienced in truth, viz. the This as a                universal, the contrary of what that
assertion claims to be universal experience.—With this appeal to the universal
experience we may be permitted to anticipate its bearing on the practical sphere. In
this regard we can tell those who affirm this truth and certainty of the reality of
sensory objects that they should be sent back to the most elementary school of
wisdom, viz. the ancient Eleusinian mysteries of Ceres and Bacchus, and still have
to learn the secret of the eating of bread and the drinking of wine; for the initiate into
these secrets not only comes to doubt the Being of sensory things, but to despair of it;

and in part he brings about the nothingness in such things himself, and in part he
sees them bring it about themselves. Even animals are not debarred from this
wisdom; on the contrary, they show themselves to be profoundly initiated into it;
for they do not just stand stock still in the presence of sensory things as if they were
beings in themselves, but, despairing of this reality and in complete certainty of their
nothingness, they help themselves without more ado and gobble them up. And all
nature, like the animals, celebrates these revealed mysteries which teach what the
truth of sensory things is.1
   ¶110. But, in accordance with our previous remarks, those who advance such an
assertion, themselves also say immediately the contrary of what they mean:—a
phenomenon which is perhaps best calculated to induce reflection on the nature of
sensory certainty. They speak of the existence of external objects, which can be more
precisely determined as actual, absolutely singular, wholly personal, individual things,
none of them absolutely similar to anything else; this Being-there, they say, has
absolute certainty and truth. They mean this bit of paper on which I am writing—or
rather have written—this; but what they mean is not what they say. If they actually
wanted to say this bit of paper which they mean, and they wanted to say it, then this is
impossible, because the sensory This that is meant is inaccessible to language, which
belongs to consciousness, to the inherently universal. In the actual attempt to say it, it
would therefore rot away; those who started to describe it could not complete the
description, but would have to leave it to others, who in the end would themselves
admit to speaking about a thing which is not. They certainly mean, then, this bit of
paper here which is another bit entirely from the bit mentioned above; but they speak
about    ‘actual  things,   external    or  sensory objects, absolutely singular entities’, and so
on; i.e. they say of them only what is universal. Consequently, what is called the
inexpressible is nothing other than the untrue, the irrational, the merely meant.—If
nothing more is said of something than that it is an actual thing, an external object,
then what is expressed is only its supreme universality and thus its                          equality   with
everything rather than its distinctness. When I say: a singular thing, I am really saying
it as  wholly universal, for everything is a singular thing; and likewise                      this  thing is
anything you like. If we designate it more exactly as this bit of paper, then each and
every bit of paper is a this bit of paper, and I have only ever said the universal. But if
I want to help out speech—which has the divine nature of directly reversing the
meaning, of making it into something else, and thus not letting it get a word in—by
pointing out      this bit of paper, experience teaches me what the truth of sensory
certainty in fact is: I point it out, as a Here, which is a Here of other Heres, or is
within itself a simple Together of many Heres, i.e. it is a universal. I take it up as it is in
truth, and instead of knowing something immediate, I perceive. 1

        II. Perception: The Thing and Illusion
¶111. Immediate certainty does not take over the true, for its truth is the universal;
whereas it wants to take the This. Perception, on the other hand, takes its beings as
something universal. Just as universality is its principle in general, the immediately
self-differentiating moments within perception are universal: the I a universal I and
the object a universal object. That principle has                 emerged for us, and therefore our
---
                                           . :                               

reception of perception is no longer a reception that appears, as that of sensory
certainty was; it is a necessary reception. The two moments, which in their appear-
ance just fall from nowhere, have come into being at the same time in the emergence
of the principle: one is the movement of pointing-out, the other same movement
as something simple; the former the perceiving, the latter the object. 1 In essence the
object is the same as the movement: the movement is the unfolding and differenti-
ation of the moments, and the object is the gathered-togetherness of the moments.
For us, or in itself, the universal as principle is the essence                   of perception, and, in
contrast to this abstraction, both the moments differentiated—the perceiver and the
perceived—are the unessential. But in fact, because both are themselves the universal
or the essence, both are essential. Yet since they are related to each other as opposites,
only one can be the essential moment in the relation, and the distinction of the
essential and the inessential must be shared between them. One of them determined
as the simple, the object, is the essence regardless of whether it is perceived or not; but
the perceiving, as the movement, is the inconstant, which can as well be as not be, and
the inessential.2
    ¶112. This object must now be determined more precisely, and this determination
must be developed briefly from the result that has been reached; the more detailed
development does not belong here. Since the principle of the object, the universal, is
in its simplicity a mediated universal, the object must express this within itself as its
nature; in this way it shows itself as the thing with many properties. The wealth of
sensory knowledge belongs to perception, not to immediate certainty, where it was
only what was in play beside it; for only perception has                         negation, difference or
manifoldness, in its essence.1
    ¶113. So the This is posited as not this, or as sublated; and hence not as Nothing,
but as a determinate Nothing or               a Nothing of a content, viz. of the This. Conse-
quently, the sensory itself is still present, but not in the way it was supposed to be in
immediate certainty, not as the singular meant, but as a universal, or as what
will determine itself as property. Sublation exhibits its veritable twofold significance
which we have seen in the negative: it is at the same time a negating and a preserving;
the Nothing, as Nothing of the This, preserves immediacy and is itself sensory, but a
universal immediacy.—But Being is a universal in virtue of its having mediation or
the negative in it; when it expresses this in its immediacy it is a distinct, determinate
property.     Many      such properties are thereby posited at the same time, one the
negative of the other. Since they are expressed in the                     simplicity    of the universal,
these determinacies, which are really properties only through the addition of a further
determination, are related to themselves, are indifferent to each other, each for itself,
free from the others. But the simple universality, equal to itself, is itself in turn
distinct and free from its determinacies. It is pure relating-itself-to-itself, or the
medium in which these determinacies all are, and so they interpenetrate in it as in
a simple unity, but without touching each other; for it is just through participation in
this universality that they are indifferent to each other, each for itself.—This abstract
universal medium, which can be called thinghood in general or the                           pure essence, is
nothing other than the            Here   and   Now, as they have proved to be, viz. a                  simple
togetherness      of many; but the many are,              in their determinacy,          simply universals
themselves. This salt is a simple Here, and at the same time manifold; it is white
---
     . 

and also tart, also cubical in shape, also of a determinate weight, etc. All these many
properties are in one simple Here, in which they therefore interpenetrate; none has a
different Here from the others, but each is everywhere, in the same Here in which the
others are. And, at the same time, without being separated by diverse Heres, they do
not affect each other in this interpenetration. The whiteness does not affect or alter
the cubical shape, and neither affects the tartness, etc.; since each is itself a simple
relating-itself-to-itself, it leaves the others alone, and is related to them only by the
indifferent
thinghood that gathers them together in this way. 1Also. This Also is thus the pure universal itself, or the medium, the
    ¶114. In the relationship which has thus emerged it is only the character of positive
universality that is at first observed and developed; but another side presents itself,
which must also be taken into consideration. That is, if the many determinate
properties were utterly indifferent to each other and were simply and solely related
to themselves, they would not be determinate; for they are determinate only insofar as
they differentiate themselves, and relate themselves to others as opposites. But in this
opposition they cannot be together in the simple unity of their medium, a unity that
is just as essential to them as negation; the differentiation of the properties, insofar as
it is not an indifferent differentiation but exclusive, negating something else, thus falls
outside this simple medium; and the medium, therefore, is not only an                                 Also, an
indifferent unity, but a        One as well, an exclusive unity.—The One is the moment of
negation; as it relates itself to itself in a simple way and excludes an other; and by this,
thinghood is determined as thing. In the property negation is as determinacy, which is
immediately one with the immediacy of Being, an immediacy which, through this
unity with negation, is universality; but the immediacy is as One, when it is set free
from this unity with the contrary and is in and for itself.1
    ¶115. In these moments taken together, the thing as the true of perception is
completed, so far as it is necessary to develop it here. It is (a) the indifferent, passive
universality, the Also of the many properties or rather matters; (b) negation, equally
simple; or the One, the exclusion of opposite properties; and (c) the many properties
themselves, the relation of the              first two moments, negation as it relates to the
indifferent element, and therein expands into a host of differences; the point of
singularity radiating out into plurality in the medium of subsistence. Insofar as these
differences belong to the indifferent medium they are themselves universal, are
related only to themselves and do not affect each other; but insofar as they belong
to the negative unity they are at the same time exclusive; but they necessarily have
this relation of opposition with properties that are remote from                            their  Also. The
sensory universality, or the           immediate      unity of Being and the negative, is thus a
property only insofar as the One and the pure universality are developed from it and
differentiated from each other, and when the sensory universality combines them; it
is only this relation of the universality to the pure essential moments which com-
pletes the thing.1
    ¶116. This, then, is how the thing of perception is constituted; and conscious-
ness is determined as perceiver insofar as this thing is its object; it has only to take
it and conduct itself as pure apprehension; and what thus presents itself to it is the
true. If consciousness itself were to do anything in this taking, it would by such
adding or omission alter the truth. Since the object is the true and universal, what is
---
                                            . :                                

equal-to-itself, while consciousness is the alterable and unessential, it can happen
that consciousness apprehends the object incorrectly and deceives itself. The per-
ceiver has consciousness of the possibility of illusion; for in the universality which is
the principle, otherness itself is immediately for it, though as what is null, sublated. Its
criterion of truth is therefore equality-to-itself, and its procedure is to apprehend the
object as equal to itself. Since at the same time diversity is for the perceiver, it is a
relating of the diverse moments of its apprehension to each other; but if a discrepancy
emerges in the course of this comparison, then this is not an untruth of the object—
for this is what is equal to itself—but an untruth of perceiving. 1
    ¶117. Let us see now what experience consciousness undergoes in its actual
perceiving.     For us, this experience is already contained in the development of the
object, and of the attitude of consciousness towards it, given just now, and it will only
be the development of the contradictions present therein.—The object that I receive
presents itself as purely one; but I also notice in it the property, which is universal and
thereby transcends singularity. The first Being of the objective essence as a One was
therefore not its true Being; since the object is the true, the untruth falls in me, and the
apprehension was not correct. Because of the                     universality    of the property, I must
rather take the objective essence as a              community in general. I now further perceive
the property as determinate, opposed to another and excluding it. Thus I did not fact
apprehend the objective essence correctly when I determined it as a community with
others, or as continuity and, because of the                   determinacy       of the property, I must
separate the continuity and posit the objective essence as a One that excludes. In the
separated One I find many such properties which do not affect each other but are
mutually indifferent; so I did not perceive the object correctly when I apprehended it
as exclusive but, just as previously it was only continuity in general, so now it is a
universal     common medium            in which many properties are present as sensory                      uni-
versalities, each being for itself and, as determinate, excluding the others. But because
of this the simple and the true that I perceive is also not a universal medium, but the
singular property for itself which, however, is thus neither property nor a determinate
Being; for now it is neither in a One nor in relation with others. But it is a property
only in the One, and determinate only in relation to others. As this pure relating-
of-itself-to-itself, it remains merely sensory Being in general, since it no longer has in
it the character of negativity; and consciousness, for which there is now a sensory
Being, is only a meaning, 1 i.e. it has entirely abandoned perception and withdrawn
into itself. But sensory Being and meaning themselves pass over into perception; I am
thrown back to the beginning and drawn once again into the same cycle which
sublates itself in each moment and as a whole.2
    ¶118. So consciousness necessarily runs through this cycle again, but this time not
in the same way as it did the first time. For it has gained the experience in perception
that the outcome and the true of perception is its dissolution, or reflection out of the
true and into itself. Thus it has been determined for consciousness how its perceiving
is essentially constituted, viz. that it is not a simple pure apprehension, but                           in its
apprehension is at the same time reflected out of the true and into itself. This return of
consciousness into itself, which immediately mingles with the pure apprehension—
for this return into itself has shown itself to be essential to perception—, alters the
true. Consciousness at once recognizes this aspect as its own and takes it upon itself,
---
     . 

and it will thereby obtain the true object in its purity.—With this, we now have in
perception the same as happened in the case of sensory certainty: the aspect in which
consciousness is driven back into itself, but not initially in the sense in which this
happened in sensory certainty, i.e. not as if the truth of perception fell in conscious-
ness. On the contrary, consciousness recognizes that what falls in it is the untruth
occurring in perception. But by this recognition it is at the same time able to sublate
this untruth; it differentiates its apprehension of the true from the untruth of its
perception, corrects this untruth, and insofar as it undertakes this correction itself,
the truth, as truth of perceiving, falls of course within consciousness. The procedure of
consciousness which we have now to consider is thus so constituted that conscious-
ness no longer merely perceives, but is also conscious of its reflection-into-itself, and
separates this from simple apprehension itself.1
    ¶119. At first, then, I become aware of the thing as One, and have to hold it fast in
this true determination; if, in the movement of perceiving, something turns up
which contradicts it, then this is to be recognized as my reflection. Now, there also
occur in the perception diverse properties which seem to be properties of the thing;
but the thing is One, and we are conscious that this diversity, by which it would
cease to be One, falls in us. So in point of fact, this thing is white only to our eyes,
also   tart to   our   tongue,    also cubical to our        feeling, and so on. We get the entire
diversity of these aspects, not from the thing, but from ourselves; and they fall
asunder in this way for us, because the eye is quite distinct from the tongue, and so
on. We are thus the universal medium in which such moments are separate and are
for themselves. Through the fact, then, that we regard the determinacy of being a
universal medium as our reflection, we maintain the equality-to-itself and truth of
the thing, its being One.1
    ¶120. But, regarded as situated, each for itself, in the universal medium, these
diverse aspects which consciousness takes upon itself are determined; white is white
only in opposition to black, and so on, and the thing is One precisely by the fact that
it is opposed to others. The thing excludes others from itself, but not insofar as it is
One—for to be One is the universal relating-to-itself, and the fact that it is One rather
makes it like all the others—but through determinacy. Things themselves are there-
fore determinate in and for themselves; they have properties by which they differen-
tiate themselves from others. Since the                 property    is the thing’s     own    property or a
determinacy in the thing itself, the thing has                   several   properties. For, in the          first
place, the thing is the true, it is in itself; and what is in it, is in it as its own essence,
and not because of other things. Secondly, therefore, the determinate properties are
not only on account of other things and for other things, but in the thing itself; but
they are determinate properties in it only because they are a plurality of properties
differentiating themselves from each other. And, thirdly, since they are thus in the
thinghood, they are in and for themselves and indifferent to each other. It is in
truth, then, the thing itself that is white, and also cubical, also                    tart, and so on. Or
the thing is the Also or the universal medium in which the many properties subsist
apart from each other, without touching or sublating each other; and taken in this
way, the thing is taken as the true.1
    ¶121. Now, in this perceiving, consciousness is at the same time conscious that it
also reflects itself into itself, and that, in perceiving, the opposite moment to the Also
---
                                            . :                               

occurs. But this moment is the unity of the thing with itself, a unity which excludes
difference from itself. Accordingly, it is this unity which consciousness has to take
upon itself; for the thing itself is the subsistence of the many diverse and independent
properties. Thus we say of the thing: it is white, also cubical, and also tart, and so on.
But insofar as it is white, it is not cubical, and insofar as it is cubical and also white, it
is not tart, and so on. The positing-into-one of these properties is due to conscious-
ness alone, which must therefore not let them fall into One in the thing. To this end it
brings in the      Insofar, and thereby keeps the properties apart, and the thing as the
Also. The oneness is taken upon itself by consciousness quite strictly, at first in such a
way that what was called property is represented as free matter. The thing is in this
way raised to a veritable Also, since it becomes a collection of matters and, instead of
being One, merely an enclosing surface.1
   ¶122. If we look back on what consciousness previously took upon itself and now
takes upon itself, on what it previously ascribed and now ascribes to the thing, it
emerges that consciousness alternately makes itself, and the thing as well, into both,
into the pure, plurality-free One, and into an Also resolved into independent matters.
Consciousness thus finds through this comparison that not only its taking of the true
has in it the diversity of apprehension and withdrawal into itself, but rather the true
itself, the thing, shows itself in this twofold way. With this the experience is at hand
that the thing       displays    itself for the    apprehending         consciousness      in a determinate
manner, but at the same time is reflected out of the manner in which it presents itself
and back into itself; or it has within itself an opposite truth. 1
   ¶123. Thus consciousness has also abandoned this second type of attitude in
perceiving, viz. taking the thing as what is truly equal-to-itself, and itself for what
is unequal, for what returns back into itself out of equality; and the object is now for
consciousness this whole movement which was previously shared between the object
and consciousness. The thing is One, reflected into itself; it is for itself, but it is also for
an other; and in fact it is an other for itself, as it is for an other. Accordingly, the thing
is for itself and also for an other, a twofold diverse Being, but it is also One; but the
oneness contradicts this diversity; accordingly consciousness would again have to
take upon itself this positing-into-one and keep it away from the thing. So it would
have to say that insofar as it is for itself, the thing is not for an other. But the oneness
also belongs to the thing itself as consciousness has found by experience; the thing is
essentially reflected into itself. The Also, or the indifferent distinction, thus falls as
much within the thing as does the oneness; but since the two are diverse they do not
fall within the same thing, but in              diverse things; the contradiction which is in the
objective essence in general is distributed between two objects. The thing is indeed in
and for itself, equal to itself, but this unity with itself is disturbed by other things; thus
the unity of the thing is maintained, and at the same time so is the otherness outside
the thing, as well as outside consciousness.1
   ¶124. Now although the contradiction of the objective essence is in this way
distributed among diverse things, yet the distinction will, for that reason, attach to
the separated singular thing itself. The diverse things are thus posited for themselves;
and the conflict falls in them reciprocally, such that each is diverse, not from itself,
but only from the other. But each is thereby determined as itself a distinct entity and
has the essential distinction from the others in it, but at the same time not in such a
---
    . 

way that this is an opposition in the thing itself; on the contrary, for itself it is simple
determinacy, which makes up the thing’s essential character, differentiating it from
others. In fact, since the diversity is in it, it is of course necessarily in it as actual
distinctness of a manifold constitution. But because the determinacy makes up the
essence of the thing, by which it differentiates itself from other things and is for itself,
this further manifold constitution is the unessential. Consequently, the thing does
indeed have the twofold Insofar within its unity, but with unequal value; as a result,
this state of opposition does not become an actual opposition in the thing itself; but
insofar as the thing through its              absolute    distinction     comes into opposition, it has
opposition to another thing outside it. Of course, the further manifoldness is
necessarily in the thing too, so that it cannot be left out, but it is unessential to it.1
   ¶125. This determinacy, which makes up the essential character of the thing and
differentiates it from all others, is now determined in such a way that the thing is
thereby in opposition to other things, but is supposed to maintain itself for itself in
this opposition. But it is only a thing, or a One that is for itself, insofar as it does not
stand in this relation to others; for in this relation rather its connection with the other
is posited, and connection with other is the cessation of Being-for-itself. It is just
through the absolute character and its opposition that it enters into relationship with
others, and is essentially only this relating; the relationship, however, is the negation
of its independence, and it is really through its essential property that the thing goes
to ruin.1
   ¶126. The necessity for consciousness of the experience that the thing goes to ruin
through the very determinacy that makes up its essence and its Being-for-itself, can
be briefly considered in terms of the simple concept. The thing is posited as Being-
for-itself, or as absolute negation of all otherness, therefore as absolute negation,
relating only to itself; but self-related negation is the sublation of itself, or having its
essence in an Other.1
   ¶127. In fact, the determination of the object, as it has emerged, contains nothing
else; the object is supposed to have within it an essential property which makes up its
simple Being-for-itself, but along with this simplicity also diversity, which is sup-
posed to be necessary, but not to make up the essential determinacy. This, however, is
a distinction that still only lies in the words; the unessential, which at the same time is
nonetheless supposed to be necessary, sublates itself, or is what has just been called
the negation of itself.1
   ¶128. With this, the last Insofar, which separated Being-for-itself from Being for
another, falls away; rather, the object is              in one and the same respect the contrary of
itself: for itself, insofar as it is for another, and for another, insofar as it is for itself. It is
for itself, reflected into itself, One; but, reflected into itself, this being One for itself,
is posited in a unity with its contrary, with Being for an Other, and hence only as
sublated; or this Being-for-itself is just as unessential as what was supposed to be the
only unessential, viz. the relationship to another.1
   ¶129. The object in its pure determinacies, or in the determinacies which were
supposed to make up its essentiality, is thereby sublated, just as it became something
sublated in its sensory Being. From sensory Being it becomes a universal; but this
universal, since it derives from the sensory, is essentially conditioned by it, and hence
is not veritably equal-to-itself at all, but universality affected with an opposite, and
---
                                           . :                               

because of this it separates into the extremes of singularity and universality, of the
One of the properties and the Also of the free matters. These pure determinacies
seem to express the           essentiality   itself, but they are only a           Being-for-Self     that is
burdened with         Being for an Other; since, however, the two are essentially                        in a
unity, the unconditioned absolute universality is now present, and consciousness
here first really enters the realm of the understanding. 1
    ¶130. Thus sensory singularity does indeed vanish in the dialectical movement
of immediate certainty and becomes universality, but only                           sensory universality.
Meaning has vanished, and perceiving takes the object as it is                           in itself, or as a
universal in general; singularity therefore emerges in the object as true singularity,
as  Being-in-itself     of the One, or as        reflectedness-into-itself. But it is still a          condi-
tioned    Being-for-itself,     alongside which         another Being-for-itself occurs, the uni-
versality opposed to singularity and conditioned by it; but these two contradictory
extremes are not merely alongside each other but in one unity; or what is the same, the
factor common to both, the             Being-for-itself,    is burdened with opposition generally,
i.e. it is at the same time not a Being-for-itself. The sophistry of perceiving seeks to save
these moments from their contradiction, and to hold onto them by differentiating
respects, by the Also and Insofar, and finally to grasp the true by differentiating the
unessential from an essence opposed to it. But these expedients, instead of warding off
illusion in the apprehension, prove rather to be futile, and the true, which is supposed
to be won by this logic of perceiving, proves to be in one and the same respect the
contrary and thus to have as its essence the universality devoid of distinctions and
determinations.1
    ¶131. These empty abstractions of singularity and the universality opposed to it, and
of the     essence   linked with something             unessential, an       unessential      which is yet
necessary all the same, are the powers whose play is the perceptual understanding,
often so-called sound common sense; it takes itself to be solid, real consciousness,
but is, in perceiving, only the play of these abstractions; generally, it is always at its
poorest where it fancies itself to be the richest. Because it is driven about by these
futile essences, thrown from one into the arms of the other and, in its endeavour by
its sophistry to hold fast and affirm alternately first one essence and then the direct
opposite, resists the truth, it supposes that philosophy has to do only with things-of-
thought. In fact, philosophy does have to do with them too and recognizes them as
the pure essences, as the absolute elements and powers; but in doing so, it recog-
nizes them in their determinacy too, and is therefore master over them, whereas this
perceptual understanding takes them for the true and is led on by them from one
error to another. It does not itself arrive at the consciousness that it is such simple
essentialities that hold sway in it, but fancies that it always has to do with wholly
solid material and content, just as sensory certainty is unaware that the empty
abstraction of pure Being is its essence; whereas it is, in fact, these essentialities in
which perceptual understanding runs to and fro through all material and content;
they are the adhesive and the mastery of that content and they alone are what the
sensory as essence        is for consciousness, what determines the relationships of the
sensory to it, and it is in them that the movement of perceiving and of its true runs
its course. This course, a perpetual alternation of determining the true and sublat-
ing this determining, really makes up the constant everyday life and activity of
---
    . 

perceptual consciousness, a consciousness which supposes it moves in the truth. It
thus advances irresistibly to the outcome in which all these essential essentialities or
determinations are equally sublated, but in each single moment it is conscious
only of this one determinacy            as the true, and then in turn of the opposite deter-
minacy. It does indeed sense their unessentiality; to save them from the threatening
danger, it resorts to the sophistry of now affirming as the true what it has itself just
affirmed as the non-true. What the nature of these untrue essences is trying to get
this understanding to do is to bring together, and thereby sublate, the thoughts                            of
these non-essences, the thoughts of that universality and singularity, of the Also and
One, of the      essentiality    that is necessarily linked to an            unessentiality, and of an
unessentiality that is nevertheless necessary. Yet the understanding resists this with
the support of the         Insofar    and of the diverse         respects, or by taking upon itself
the one thought in order to keep the other quarantined as the true thought. But the
nature of these abstractions brings them together in and for themselves; sound
common sense is the prey of these abstractions, which spin it round and round in
their whirling circle. Common sense tries to bestow truth on them by at one time
taking their untruth upon itself, while at another time it calls illusion a semblance
of the unreliable things, and by separating the essential from what is necessary to
them yet supposedly unessential, and hanging on to the former as their truth as
against the latter; but when it does this, it does not secure them their truth, it
convicts itself of untruth.1
        III. Force and Understanding: Appearance
        and Supersensible World
¶132. In the dialectic of sensory certainty, hearing and seeing, etc., have been lost to
consciousness, and, as perceiving, consciousness has arrived at thoughts, which it
first brings together, however, in the unconditioned universal. This unconditioned
would now itself in turn be nothing other than the one-sided extreme of Being-for-
itself, if it were taken as inert simple essence, for it would then be confronted by non-
essence; but, if it were related to this, it would itself be unessential, and consciousness
would not have escaped from the illusion of perception; however, it has proved to be
the sort of universal that has returned into itself out of such a conditioned Being-for-
itself.—This unconditioned universal, which is now the true object of consciousness,
is still as object of it; consciousness has not yet grasped its concept                   as concept. It is
essential to distinguish the two: for consciousness, the object has returned into itself
from its relationship to an other and has thus become concept                          in itself; but con-
sciousness is not yet for itself the concept, and consequently does not recognize itself
in that reflected object.       For us, this object has emerged through the movement of
consciousness in such a way that consciousness is involved in the emergence of it,
and the reflection on both sides is the same or only one reflection. But since in this
movement consciousness had for its content only the objective essence, not con-
sciousness as such, for consciousness the result is to be posited in objective signifi-
cance and consciousness is still drawing back from what has emerged, so that to
consciousness it is the essence as objective.1
---
                                                           .                     

    ¶133. With this, the understanding has indeed sublated its own untruth and the
untruth of the object; and what has thereby emerged for it is the concept of the true,
as a true that is in itself, which is not yet concept, or which lacks the Being-for-itself
of consciousness, and which the understanding, without knowing itself therein, lets
go its own way. The true goes about its essential business for itself, so that conscious-
ness plays no part in its free realization, but merely looks on and simply apprehends
it. To begin with, therefore, we have to step into its place and be the concept which
develops what is contained in the result; in this developed object, which presents itself
to consciousness as something that simply is, consciousness first becomes explicitly a
comprehending consciousness.1
    ¶134. The result was the unconditioned universal, initially in the negative and
abstract sense that consciousness negated its one-sided concepts and abstracted them,
that is, gave them up. But the result has, in itself, a positive significance: in it, the unity
of  Being-for-itself     and    Being for an other        is posited or the absolute opposition is
immediately posited as the same essence. It initially seems to concern only the
form of the moments in reciprocal relation; but Being-for-itself and Being-for-
other are the       content    itself as well, since the opposition in its truth can have no
other nature than the one that emerged in the result, viz. that the content taken in
perception to be true, belongs in fact only to the form and dissolves in the unity of
the form. This content is at the same time universal; there can be no other content
which by its particular constitution would resist integration in this unconditioned
universality. A content of this kind would be some determinate way of being for itself
and of relating to another. But to be for itself and to relate to another in general makes
up the nature and essence           of the content, and their truth is to be an unconditioned
universal; and the result is purely and simply universal.1
    ¶135. But because this unconditioned universal is object for consciousness, there
emerges in it the distinction of form and content, and in the shape of content the
moments look like they did when they                    first presented themselves: on one side, a
universal medium of many subsistent matters, and on the other side, a One reflected
into itself, in which their independence is extinguished. The former is the dissolution
of the thing’s independence, or the passivity that is a Being for an Other, while the
latter is Being-for-itself. We have to see how these moments exhibit themselves in the
unconditioned universality which is their essence. It is clear at the outset that, since
they are only in this universality, they are no longer detached from each other at all
but are within themselves essentially self-sublating sides, and what is posited is only
their transition into each other.1
    ¶136. So one of the moments appears as the essence that has stepped to one side, as
universal medium, or as the subsistence of independent matters. But the independ-
ence of these matters is nothing other than this medium; or this universal is simply
and solely the plurality of the diverse universals of this kind. That within itself the
universal is in undivided unity with this plurality means, however, that these matters
are each where the other is; they mutually interpenetrate,—but without coming into
contact with each other, because conversely the differentiated plurality is equally
independent. At the same time their pure porosity or their sublatedness is thereby
posited. This sublatedness or the reduction of this diversity to a pure Being-for-itself,
is in turn nothing other than the medium itself, and this is the                           independence  of
---
    . 

the differences. Or the matters posited as independent immediately pass over into
their unity, and their unity immediately passes over into unfolding, and this again
goes back into reduction. But this movement is what is called                         force: one of its
moments, namely the force as expansion of the independent matters in their
Being, is the expression of force; but the force as the disappearance of the matters
is the force driven back into itself out of its expression or the force proper. First,
however, the force driven back into itself must express itself; and, secondly, in the
expression it is force that is within itself, just as much as it is expression in this
Being-within-itself.—When we thus keep the two moments in their immediate
unity, the understanding, to which the concept of force belongs, is strictly
speaking the concept which sustains the different moments as different; for within
themselves, they are not supposed to be different; the difference is thus only in
thought.—Or what has been posited in the foregoing is at first only the concept of
force, not its reality. In fact, however, force is the unconditioned universal which
is equally in itself what it is for an Other; or which contains the difference within
itself—for difference is nothing other than the Being for an Other. So for force to
be in its truth, it must be completely set free from thought and posited as the
substance of these differences, i.e. first:          substance, as this whole force, remaining
essentially in and for itself, and then: its differences as substantial, or as moments
subsisting for themselves. Force as such, or as driven back into itself, is thus for
itself as  an exclusive One, for which the unfolding of the matters is                           another
subsisting essence; and thus two distinct independent sides are posited. But the
force is also the whole, or it remains what it is according to its concept, that is,
these differences     remain pure forms, superficial vanishing moments. At the same
time there would be no difference at all between the force proper driven back into
itself and the      unfolding     of the independent matters, if they did not have a
subsistence, or there would be no force if it did not exist in these opposite ways;
but that it does exist in these opposite ways means nothing other than: the two
moments are at the same time themselves                      independent.—It is therefore this
movement in which the two moments perpetually acquire independence and
then sublate themselves again that we are to consider.—It is clear in general
that this movement is nothing other than the movement of perceiving, in which
the two sides, the perceiver and the perceived, are on the one hand one and
undifferentiated as the        apprehension of the true, and yet each side is at the same
time equally reflected into itself or is for itself. These two sides are here moments
of force; they are in a unity, but equally this unity, which appears as the middle
term over against the extremes that are for themselves, perpetually disintegrates
into just these extremes, which only are because of this.—Thus the movement,
which previously displayed itself as the self-annihilation of contradictory con-
cepts, here has the objective form and is movement of force, as a result of which
the unconditioned universal emerges as something non-objective, or as the inter-
ior of things. 1
   ¶137. Force, as thus determined, is one side of its concept, since it is represented
as such or as reflected into itself; but as a substantialized extreme and, in fact, the
extreme posited under the determinacy of the One. The subsistence of the unfolded
matters is thereby excluded from force and is an other than force. Since it is necessary
---
                                                           .                          

that force itself be this subsistence, or that force express itself, its expression presents
itself like this:    this other approaches         the force and solicits it. But in fact, since it
necessarily expresses itself, what was posited as another essence is in the force itself.
Force was posited as a One, and its essence, self-expression, was posited as an Other,
approaching it from outside. But this must be retracted: force is rather itself this
universal medium of the subsistence of the moments as matters; or                                    force has
expressed itself, and what was supposed to be the other soliciting it is really force
itself. So now it exists as the medium of the unfolded matters. But equally essentially
it has the form of the sublatedness of the subsisting matters, or is essentially One;
this oneness, since force is posited as the medium of matters, is thus now something
other than force, and force has this its essence outside it. But since force must
necessarily be this oneness, but is not yet posited as oneness, this other approaches
it and solicits it to reflection into itself or sublates its expression. But in fact force itself
is this reflectedness-into-itself, or this sublatedness of the expression; the oneness, in
the way in which it appeared, viz. as an Other, vanishes; force is this other itself, it is
force driven back into itself.1
    ¶138. What turns up as other and solicits force, both to expression and to return
into itself, immediately proves to be               itself force; for the other shows up both as
universal medium and as One, and in such a way that each of these shapes at the
same time turns up only as a vanishing moment. Consequently, force, by the fact that
an other is for it and it is for an Other, has not yet emerged from its concept at all.
But there are at the same time two forces present; the concept of both is no doubt
the same, but it has emerged from its unity into duality. Instead of remaining
entirely and essentially only a moment, the opposition seems, by the bifurcation
into wholly independent forces, to have withdrawn from the dominion of unity. We
have now to see more closely what the situation is with this independence. Initially
the second force turns up as the one that solicits and moreover, in its content, as
the universal medium in contrast to the force determined as solicited; but since the
second force is essentially an alternation of these two moments and is itself force,
in fact it is similarly the universal medium                  only when it is solicited to be so, and
similarly, too, it is a negative unity, or solicits the withdrawal of force, only because
it is solicited. Consequently, this distinction, too, which obtained between the two
forces, that one was supposed to be the
transformed into the same reciprocal exchange of the determinacies.1soliciting force, the other the solicited, is
    ¶139. The play of the two forces thus consists in their being determined in
opposite ways, their Being-for-one-another in this determination, and the absolute,
immediate alternation of the determinations,—a transition through which alone
these determinations are, in which the forces seem to turn up independently. The
soliciting force, e.g., is posited as universal medium, and the solicited, by contrast, as
repressed force; but the former is itself universal medium only through the other’s
being repressed force; or the latter is really the soliciting force for the former and is
what    first makes it a medium. The first force has its determinacy only through the
other and is soliciting only insofar as it is solicited by the other to be soliciting; and
just as immediately, it loses the determinacy given to it; for this passes over, or rather
has already passed over, to the other; the external soliciting force turns up as a universal
medium, but only through its having been solicited by the other force to do so; but
---
    . 

this means that       the latter posits     the soliciting force in this way and              is  really   itself
essentially a universal medium; it posits the soliciting force in this way just because
this other determination is essential to it, i.e. because this is really its own self.1
   ¶140. For the completion of insight into the concept of this movement attention
may be drawn to a further point, that the differences themselves show up in a twofold
difference: once as a difference of content, in that one extreme is force reflected into
itself, while the other is a medium of the matters; and again as a difference of form, in
that one is soliciting, the other solicited, the former active, the latter passive. By the
difference of content they are differentiated in general or for us; but by the difference
of form they are independent, separating from each other in their relation and
opposed. The extremes on both these sides are thus nothing                            in themselves; these
sides in which their different essence was supposed to consist are only vanishing
moments, are an immediate transition of each side into the opposite side; and this
fact comes to be for consciousness in its perception of the movement of force. But for
us, as we remarked already, there was also something more, viz. that in themselves
the differences, as      differences of content and of form, vanished; and on the side of
form, the active, soliciting factor or that-which-is-for-itself, was in essence the same
as that which, on the side of content, presented itself as force driven back into itself;
the passive, solicited factor or that which is for an other on the side of form, was in
essence the same as that which, on the side of content, presented itself as the universal
medium of the many matters.1
   ¶141. It results from this that the concept of force becomes actual through dupli-
cation into two forces, and how it comes to do so. These two forces exist as essences
that are for themselves; but their existence is a movement of each towards the other,
such that their Being is rather a pure positedness through an Other, i.e. their Being has
really the pure significance of vanishing. They are not the sort of extremes that retain
for themselves something            firm, transmitting towards each other into the middle
term and into their contact only an external property; on the contrary, what they
are, they are only in this middle term and contact. In this there is immediately both
the repression of force into itself, or its              Being-for-itself, and its expression, both
soliciting and being solicited; consequently, these moments are not distributed to
two independent extremes offering each other only an opposed extremity, but their
essence is purely and simply this: each is solely through the other, and what each
force thus is through the other, it immediately no longer is, while it is it. They have
thus, in fact, no substances of their own to support and maintain them. The concept
of force rather maintains itself as           the essence     in its very    actuality; force as actual is
simply and solely in the expression, which at the same time is nothing other than a
sublation of itself. This actual force, represented as being free from its expression and
as being for itself, it is the force driven back into itself; but in fact this determinacy, as
we have found, is itself only a moment of the                    expression. Thus the truth of force
remains only the        thought of force; the moments of its actuality, its substances and
its movement, collapse unresistingly into an undifferentiated unity, a unity which is
not force driven back into itself (for this is itself only such a moment), but this
unity is   its concept as concept. Thus the realization of force is at the same time
loss of reality; in that realization it has really become something quite different, viz.
this universality, which the understanding recognizes at the outset or immediately

as its essence and which also proves to be its essence in the supposed reality of
force, in the actual substances.1
     ¶142. Insofar as we regard                                  the first universal as the understanding’s                                                concept          in
which force is not yet for itself, the second is now the essence of force as it exhibits
itself in and for itself. Or, conversely, if we regard the first universal as the immediate,
which was supposed to be an actual                                              object for consciousness, then this second is
determined as the negative of the sensorily objective force; it is force as it is, in its true
essence, only as object of the understanding; the first universal would be force driven
back into itself, or force as substance; while the second is the
interior, which is the same as the concept as concept. 1                                                                             interior of things, as
     ¶143. This veritable essence of things has now determined itself in such a way that
it is not immediately for consciousness; on the contrary, consciousness has a medi-
ated relationship to the interior and, as understanding, looks through this intermedi-
ary play of forces into the true background of things. The middle term which unites the
two extremes, the understanding and the interior, is the developed                                                                                Being of force
which, for the understanding itself, is henceforth a vanishing. This Being is therefore
called 1 But it is not only a semblance; it is appearance, a that is a of semblance. Thisappearance; for semblance is what we call Being    non-Being              within
itself.                                                                                                                    whole
whole, as whole or as a universal, is what constitutes the interior, the play                                                                                  of forces
as    reflection           of the interior into itself. In it, the essences of perception are posited
for consciousness in an objective way, as they are in themselves, viz. as moments
immediately turning into the opposite without rest or Being, the One immediately
into the universal, the essential immediately into the unessential, and vice versa. This
play of forces is consequently the developed negative; but the truth of this negative is
the positive, viz. the universal, the object that is in itself.—The Being of this object for
consciousness is mediated through the movement of appearance, in which the Being
of perception and the sensorily objective in general has only negative significance, and
so consciousness reflects itself out of this movement back into itself as the true; but, as
consciousness, it makes this truth again into an objective                                                                    interior, and differenti-
ates this reflection of things from its own reflection into itself; just as the media-
ting movement is likewise still an objective movement for it. For consciousness this
interior is therefore an extreme over against it; but it is for consciousness the true,
because in the interior, as the in-itself, it has at the same time the certainty of itself, or
the moment of its Being-for-itself; but it is not yet conscious of this ground, for
the Being-for-itself which the interior was supposed to have in its own self would be
nothing other than the negative movement; but for consciousness this is still the
objective vanishing appearance, not yet its own Being-for-itself; therefore the interior
is for it certainly concept, but it does not yet know the nature of the concept.2
     ¶144. Within this interior truth, as the absolute universal which has been purged
of the opposition of the universal and singular and has come to be for the understand-
ing, for the             first time there now opens up above the sensory world, as the apparent
world, a supersensible world as the true world, above the vanishing Hither there opens
up the enduring                       Beyond; an in-itself which is the                                         first, and therefore imperfect,
appearance of reason, or only the pure element in which the truth has its essence.1
     ¶145. Our object is thus from now on the syllogism which has for its extremes the
interior of things and the understanding, and for its middle term, appearance; but the
---
     . 

movement of this syllogism gives the further determination of what the understand-
ing discerns in the interior through the middle term, and provides the experience that
the understanding gains of this relationship of syllogistic interconnectedness.1
    ¶146. For consciousness the interior is still               pure Beyond, because consciousness
does not yet       find itself in it; the interior is        empty, for it is merely the nothing of
appearance, and positively the simple universal. This mode of being of the interior
immediately accords with those who say that the interior of things is not cognizable;
but the ground for this would have to be conceived otherwise. Certainly, no know-
ledge of this interior is forthcoming as it is here in its immediacy, but not because
reason is too short-sighted or limited, or however else one likes to call it—on this
question nothing is known yet, because we have not yet penetrated that deeply—but
owing to the simple nature of the Thing itself, that is to say, because in the                              void
nothing is cognized, or, expressed from the other side, just because this interior is
determined as the Beyond of consciousness.—The result is, of course, the same if a
blind person is placed amid the wealth of the supersensible world (assuming it has
such wealth, whether it be its own specific content, or whether consciousness itself be
this content), and if a sighted person is placed in pure darkness, or if you like, in pure
light, if the supersensible world is just this; the sighted person sees as little in its pure
light as in its pure darkness, and just as much as the blind person, in the abundance
of the wealth that lies before him. If that were all there was to the interior and to our
unification with it through appearance, then nothing would remain but to stick
to appearance, i.e. to take something as true which we know is not true; or, in
order that there may after all be something in the void—which of course first came
about as emptiness of objective things, but must, as emptiness in itself, be taken also
as emptiness of all spiritual relationships and of the distinctions of consciousness as
consciousness—in order, then, that in this                  complete void, which is even called the
holy, there may be something after all, we would have to                          fill it up with reveries,
appearances, which consciousness engenders by itself; it would have to put up with
being treated so badly, for it would not deserve anything better, since even reveries
are better than its emptiness.1
    ¶147. The interior or the supersensible Beyond has, however, arisen, it comes from
appearance, and appearance is its mediation; or appearance is its essence and, in fact,
its filling. The supersensible is the sensory and the perceived posited as it is in truth;
but the truth of the sensory and the perceived is to be appearance. The supersensible
is therefore      appearance      as  appearance.—If this leads us to think that the super-
sensible is therefore the sensory world, or the world as it is for immediate sensory
certainty and perception, then our understanding is topsy-turvy; for appearance is not
the world of sensory knowledge and perception as a world that simply is, but this
world posited as sublated, or in truth as inner. It is often said that the supersensible is
not appearance; but what is here understood by appearance is not appearance, but
rather the sensory world as itself real actuality. 1
    ¶148. The understanding, which is our object, finds itself in just this position, that
the interior has come about for it, to begin with, only as the universal, still unfilled in-
itself; the play of forces has just this sole negative significance of not being in itself,
and this sole positive significance of being the intermediary, but outside the under-
standing. The relation of the understanding to the interior through the mediation is,

                                                          .                    

however, its movement, through which the interior will fill itself out for the under-
standing.—The play of forces is immediately for the understanding; but the true for it
is the simple interior; the movement of force is therefore likewise the true only as
something altogether          simple. We have seen, however, that this play of forces is so
constituted that the force which is solicited by another force is equally the soliciting
force for this other force, which becomes itself a soliciting force only in virtue of this.
What is present in this interplay is likewise merely the immediate alternation, or the
absolute interchange, of the determinacy which constitutes the sole content of what
emerges: to be either universal medium or negative unity. In its determinate emer-
gence itself, it immediately ceases to be what it is on emerging; by its determinate
emergence, it solicits the other side, which thereby expresses itself; that is, the latter is
now immediately what the first was supposed to be. These two sides, the relationship
of soliciting and the relationship of the opposed determinate content, are                     each for
itself the absolute reversal and interchange. But these two relationships themselves
are again one and the same; and the difference of form, of being the solicited and the
soliciting, is the same as the difference of content, the solicited as such, viz. the passive
medium, on the other hand the soliciting, the active, the negative unity or the One. In
this way there vanishes all difference of particular forces which were supposed to be
present in this movement, confronting each other in general, for they rested solely
on those differences; and the difference between the forces, along with both those
differences, likewise collapses into only one difference. Thus there is neither force,
nor soliciting and being solicited, nor the determinacy of being a subsistent medium
and a unity reflected into itself, there is neither something singly for itself, nor diverse
oppositions; but what there is in this absolute exchange is only difference as universal,
or as difference to which the many oppositions have been reduced. This difference as
universal is consequently the simplicity in the play of force itself and the truth of this
play; it is the law of force.1
   ¶149. The absolutely changing appearance becomes the simple difference through
its relation to the simplicity of the interior or of the understanding. The interior is
initially only the universal in itself; but this in itself simple universal is essentially no
less absolutely the universal difference: for it is the result of the exchange itself, or the
exchange is its essence; but the exchange, since it is posited in the interior as it is in
truth, is herewith received in that interior as likewise absolutely universal difference,
becalmed and remaining equal to itself. Or negation is essential moment of the
universal, and negation, or mediation, is therefore, in the universal, universal differ-
ence. This difference is expressed in the law, as the stable image of restless appear-
ance. Thus the supersensible world is a calm realm of laws which, though beyond the
perceived world—for this exhibits the law only through incessant change—is equally
present in it and is its immediate tranquil image. 1
   ¶150. This realm of laws is indeed the truth of the understanding, and this truth
has the content in the difference that is in the law; but at the same time this realm is
only its initial truth and does not fill out appearance completely. The law is present in
appearance, but is not the whole presence of appearance; with every change of
circumstance the law has a different actuality. Thus appearance retains                        for itself
an aspect that is not in the interior; or appearance is in truth not yet posited as
appearance, as       sublated     Being-for-itself. This deficiency of the law must equally
---
     . 

reveal itself in the law itself. What seems to be defective in it is that while it does have
difference in it, the difference is universal, indeterminate. However, insofar as it is not
the law in general, but a law, it does have determinacy in it; consequently, there are
indefinitely     many     laws. But this multiplicity is itself rather a defect; that is, it
contradicts the principle of the understanding for which, as consciousness of the
simple interior, the true is the in itself universal                  unity. The understanding must
therefore let the many laws coincide in one law, just as, e.g., the law by which a stone
falls, and the law by which the heavenly spheres move, have been comprehended as
one law. But with this convergence the laws lose their determinacy; the law becomes
more and more superficial, and as a result what is found is, in fact, not the unity of
these determinate laws, but a law which leaves out their determinacy; as, e.g., the one
law which combines in itself the laws of the fall of bodies to the earth and the law
of heavenly motion, in fact expresses neither law. The unification of all laws in
universal attraction        expresses no more content than just the                   mere concept of law
itself, which is posited in that law as simply being. Universal attraction merely says
that   everything     has   a constant difference         in relation to      other    things. The under-
standing supposes that it has thereby found a universal law which expresses the
universal actuality        as such; but in fact it has only found the                concept of law itself;
although in such a way that at the same time it thereby declares: all actuality is in its
own self     conformable to law. The expression                of universal attraction is therefore of
great importance insofar as it is directed against the thoughtless representation to
which everything presents itself in the shape of contingency and for which deter-
minacy has the form of sensory independence.1
    ¶151. Thus universal attraction, or the pure concept of law, stands in contrast to
determinate laws. Insofar as this pure concept is regarded as the essence, or as the
true interior, the determinacy of the determinate law itself still belongs to appearance,
or rather to sensory Being. But the pure concept of law does not merely go beyond the
law which, itself a determinate law, stands in contrast to other determinate laws, but
also goes beyond law as such. The determinacy of which we spoke is itself really only a
vanishing moment which can no longer occur here as essentiality; for only the law is
present as the true; but the concept of law is turned against the law itself. That is to
say, in the law the difference itself is apprehended immediately and taken up into the
universal, but, along with that, a              subsistence    of the moments, whose relation the
universal expresses, as essentialities that are indifferent and in-themselves. But these
parts of the difference in the law are at the same time themselves determinate sides; in
its true meaning, the pure concept of law as universal attraction must be conceived in
such a way that in this concept, as something absolutely simple, the differences, that
are present in the law as such, themselves
unity; this unity is the inner necessity of the law. 1return again into the interior as simple
    ¶152. The law is thereby present in a twofold manner: once, as law in which the
differences are expressed as independent moments; and, secondly, in the form of
simple Being-withdrawn-into-itself which again can be called force, but in such a way
that it is not repressed force, but force in general, or as the concept of force, an
abstraction which absorbs into itself the very differences of what attracts and what is
attracted. Thus simple          electricity, e.g., is the force; but the expression of difference
falls within the law; this difference is positive and negative electricity. In the case of
---
                                                           .                           

the motion of falling, the force is the simple factor, gravity, which has the law that
the magnitudes of the different moments of the motion, the time elapsed and the
space   traversed, are related to each other as root and square. Electricity itself is
not difference in itself, or in its essence the dual essence of positive and negative
electricity; hence, it is usually said that it has the law to be in this way, and also that it
has the property of expressing itself thus. It is true that this property is the essential
and unique property of this force, or that it is necessary to it. But necessity here is an
empty word; force must duplicate itself in this way, just because it must. Of course, if
positive   electricity is posited,        negative    electricity too is necessary          in itself; for the
positive is only as relation to a negative, or the positive is in its own self the difference
from itself, as similarly the negative. But that electricity as such should divide itself in
this way is not in itself the necessity; electricity, as simple force, is indifferent to its
law—to be as positive and negative; and if we call the former its concept but the latter
its Being, then its concept is indifferent to its Being; it merely has this property; that
is, precisely, it is not in itself necessary to it.—This indifference takes another shape
when it is said that to be as positive and negative belongs to the                               definition     of
electricity, or that this is simply             its concept and essence. In that case, its Being
would mean its existence in general; but the necessity of its existence is not involved
in that definition; its existence is there, either because we find it, i.e. it is not necessary
at all, or by means of other forces, i.e. its necessity is an external necessity. But in
locating the necessity in the determinacy of Being through something else, we relapse
again into the multiplicity of determinate laws which we have just left behind in order
to consider the law as law; it is only with this law as law that we should compare its
concept as concept, or its necessity, but in all these forms, necessity has shown itself to
be still only an empty word.1
   ¶153. There is still another way than that just indicated in which the indifference
of law and force, or of concept and Being, is present. In the law of motion, e.g., it is
necessary that motion be divided into time and space, or then also into distance and
velocity. Since motion is only the relationship of these moments, motion (the
universal) is here certainly divided              in its own self; but now these parts, time and
space, or distance and velocity, do not express in themselves this origin from one
thing; they are indifferent to each other, space is represented as able to be without
time, time without space, and distance at least without velocity,—just as their
magnitudes are indifferent to each other; since they do not stand in relationship                               as
positive and negative, and thus are not related to each other through their essence. The
necessity of the      division    is thus certainly present here, but not the necessity of the
parts as such for each other. But because of this that first necessity, too, is itself only a
sham, false necessity; that is, motion is not itself represented as something simple, or
as pure essence, but already as divided; time and space are its independent parts or
essences in themselves, or distance and velocity are modes of Being or of representa-
tion, one of which can well be without the other, and motion is therefore only their
superficial    relation, not their essence. Represented as simple essence or as force,
motion is indeed gravity, but gravity does not contain these differences in it at all.1
   ¶154. The difference, then, in both cases is no difference in its own self: either the
universal, the force, is indifferent to the division which is in the law, or the differ-
ences, the parts, of the law are indifferent to each other. The understanding, however,
---
    . 

has the concept of this difference in itself just because the law is, on the one hand, the
interior, what-is-in-itself, but is, at the same time, internally differentiated; that this
difference is thus inner difference is implied in the fact that the law is simple force or
as concept of the difference, and therefore a difference of the concept. But at first this
inner difference still falls only within the understanding, and is not yet posited in the
Thing itself. It is therefore only its own necessity that the understanding announces; a
difference that it therefore establishes only by declaring at the same time that the
difference is not a difference of the Thing itself. This necessity, which is merely verbal,
is thus a recital of the moments that constitute the cycle of the necessity; these
moments are indeed differentiated, but at the same time their difference is expressly
said to be not a difference of the Thing itself, and consequently is itself at once
sublated again; this movement is called explanation. So a law is enunciated; from this
law, its universal in itself, or the ground, is differentiated as the force; but it is said that
this difference is no difference, rather that the ground is constituted exactly like the
law. The single occurrence of lightning, e.g., is apprehended as a universal, and this
universal is enunciated as the law of electricity; the explanation then condenses the
law into the force as the essence of the law. This force is then so constituted that when
it expresses itself, opposite electricities emerge, which disappear again into each
other; that is,     the force is constituted exactly like the law; there is said to be no
difference whatever between them. The differences are the pure, universal expression
or the law, and the pure force; but both have the same content, the same constitution:
so the difference as difference of content, i.e. of the Thing, is also again withdrawn.1
   ¶155. In this tautological movement, the understanding, as it turns out, sticks to
the inert unity of its object, and the movement falls only in the understanding itself,
not in the object; it is an explanation that not only explains nothing, but is so plain
that, while it prepares to say something different from what has already been said, it
really says nothing but only repeats the same thing. In the Thing itself this movement
gives rise to nothing new; it comes into consideration only as a movement of the
understanding. In it, however, we now recognize the very thing that was missing in
the law, viz. the absolute exchange itself; for this movement, when we look at it more
closely, is immediately the opposite of itself. That is to say, it posits a difference which
is not only not a difference for us, but a difference that the movement itself sublates as
a difference. This is the same exchange that presented itself as the play of forces; this
involved the difference of the soliciting and the solicited, of force expressing itself and
force repressed into itself; but these were differences which in truth were no differ-
ences, and therefore also immediately sublated themselves again. What is present
here is not merely bare unity, such that no difference would be posited, but rather this
movement in which a difference is certainly established, but, because it is no differ-
ence, is sublated again. With explanation, then, the change and exchange which just
now was outside the interior and only in the appearance, has penetrated into the
supersensible itself; but our consciousness has passed over from the interior as object
to the other side, into the understanding, and there it has the exchange. 1
   ¶156. Thus this exchange is not yet an exchange of the Thing itself, but rather
presents itself as pure exchange by the very fact that the content of the moments of the
exchange remains the same. But since the concept, as concept of the understanding, is
the same as the interior of things, this exchange becomes as law of the interior for the
---
                                                           .                           

understanding. The understanding thus undergoes the experience that it is a law of
appearance itself       that differences arise which are no differences, or that the                         like-
named repels itself from itself; and similarly, that the differences are only such as are
in truth no differences and sublate themselves; or that the                         unlike-named attracts
itself.—A second law whose content is opposed to what was just now called law, viz.
the difference remaining constantly like itself; for this new law expresses rather the
becoming-unlike of the like and the becoming-like of the unlike. The concept expects
thoughtlessness to bring both laws together and to become conscious of their
opposition.—The second is certainly also a law or an inner Being that is like itself,
but a self-likeness rather of unlikeness; a constancy of inconstancy.—In the play of
forces this law emerged precisely as this absolute passing-over and pure exchange; the
like-named, the force,         decomposes       into an opposition which at              first appears as an
independent difference, but which in fact proves to be no difference; for it is the like-
named which repels itself from itself, and therefore what is thus repelled essentially
attracts itself, for it is the same; the difference established, since it is no difference,
therefore sublates itself again. Consequently, the difference displays itself as differ-
ence of the Thing itself or as absolute difference, and this difference of the Thing                            is
thus nothing other than the like-named that has repelled itself from itself, and
therefore merely posits an opposition which is no opposition.1
   ¶157. Through this principle, the first supersensible, the tranquil kingdom of laws,
the immediate copy of the perceived world, is turned round into its contrary; the law
in general was that which remains like itself, along with its differences; now, however,
it is posited that each of the two is really the contrary of itself; what is like itself really
repels itself from itself, and what is unlike itself really posits itself as what is like itself.
In fact, it is only when thus determined that the difference is the inner difference, or
difference in its own self, when the like is unlike itself, and the unlike like itself.—This
second supersensible world is in this way the                 inverted    world; and indeed, since one
side is already present in the first supersensible world, the inversion of this first world.
With this, the interior is completed as appearance. For the first supersensible world
was only the immediate elevation of the perceived world into the universal element; it
had its necessary counterpart in the perceived world which still retained for itself the
principle of exchange and alteration; the first realm of laws lacked that principle, but
acquires it as inverted world.1
   ¶158. So by the law of this inverted world, the like-named in the first world is the
unlike   of itself, and what is         unlike    in the    first world is equally        unlike itself, or it
becomes like itself. In determinate moments, the result will be this: what in the law of
the first world is sweet, in this inverted in-itself is sour, what in the former is black is,
in the other, white. What in the law of the first is the north pole of the magnet is, in its
other, supersensible in-itself (viz. in the earth), the south pole; but what is there south
pole is here north pole.1 Similarly, what in the first law of electricity is the oxygen pole
becomes in its other, supersensible essence, hydrogen pole; and conversely, what is
there the hydrogen pole becomes here the oxygen pole. In another sphere, revenge on
an enemy is, by the immediate law, the supreme satisfaction of the injured individu-
ality. This law, however, that I should display myself as essence in the face of one who
does not treat me as an independent essence, and rather sublate him as essence,
inverts itself by the principle of the other world into the opposite law: the restoration
---
    . 

of myself as the essence by the sublation of the alien essence inverts itself into self-
destruction. If, now, this inversion, which is displayed in the punishment of crime, is
made into a law, it, too, is again only the law of the one world, which has confronting
it an inverted supersensible world, in which what is contemned in the former meets
with honour, and what in the former is held in honour, falls into contempt. The
punishment which by the law of the                first world    disgraces and annihilates a man, is
transformed in its inverted world into the pardon which preserves his essence and
brings him to honour.2
   ¶159. Looked at superficially, this inverted world is the contrary of the first in the
sense that it has the        first world outside it and repels it from itself as an inverted
actuality, that the one is appearance, while the other is the in-itself, that the one is the
world as it is for an Other, whereas the other by contrast is the world as it is for itself;
so that, to use the previous examples, what tastes sweet would be really, or internally
in the thing, sour; or what is north pole in the actual magnet of appearance, would be
south pole     in the inner or essential Being; what presents itself as oxygen pole in
apparent electricity would be hydrogen pole in unapparent electricity. Or an action,
which in appearance is a crime, should, in the interior, be capable of really being good
(a bad action may have a good intention), punishment should be punishment only in
appearance, but in itself, or in another world, a benefit for the criminal. But such
oppositions of inner and outer, of appearance and supersensible, as of two kinds of
actuality, are no longer present here. The repelled differences are not distributed
anew among two substances such as would support them and lend them a separate
subsistence, whereby the understanding would withdraw from the interior and
relapse again into its previous position. The one side, or substance, would again be
the world of perception in which one of the two laws would go about its essential
business, and confronting it would be an inner world, just such a sensory world as the
first, only in representation; it could not be exhibited as a sensory world, could not be
seen, heard, tasted, and yet it would be represented as such a sensory world. But in
fact, if the one posit is something perceived, and its in-itself, as its inversion, is equally
something represented, then the sour which would be the in-itself of the sweet thing is
a thing just as actual as the sweet thing, viz. a sour thing; the black, which would be
the in-itself of the white, is an actual black; the north pole which is the in-itself of the
south pole is the north pole present in the same magnet; the oxygen pole which is the
in-itself of the hydrogen pole is the oxygen pole present in the same pile. The actual
crime, however, has         its inversion and       its in-itself   as  possibility, in the intention as
such, but not in a good intention; for the truth of the intention is only the deed itself.
But as regards its content, the crime has its reflection into itself, or its inversion, in the
actual punishment; this is the reconciliation of the law with the actuality opposed to
it in the crime. Finally, the actual punishment has its inverted actuality in it in such a
way that the punishment is an actualization of the law, whereby the activity exercised
by the law as punishment             sublates itself, and, from being active, the law becomes
again quiescent and valid, and the movement of individuality against the law, and the
movement of the law against individuality, are extinguished.1
   ¶160. So from the representation of inversion, which constitutes the essence of one
side of the supersensible world, we must remove the sensory representation of the
consolidation of the differences in a distinct element of subsistence, and this absolute
---
                                                           .                           

concept of the difference must be presented and conceived purely, as inner differ-
ence, as repulsion of the          like-named, as like-named, from itself, and the being like
of the unlike as unlike. We have to                  think    the pure exchange,           or the opposition
within itself, the contradiction. For in the difference which is an inner difference,
the opposite is not merely one of two;—if it were, it would be just a                            being, not an
opposite;—but it is the opposite of an opposite, or the other is itself immediately
present in it. Certainly, I put the contrary                 here, and the other of which it is the
contrary, there; so I put the contrary on one side, in and for itself without the other.
But just because I have here the contrary in and for itself, it is the contrary of itself, or
it has in fact the other immediately within itself. Thus the supersensible world, which
is the inverted world, has at the same time encroached upon the other world and has
it within itself; it is for itself the inverted world, i.e. the inversion of itself; it is itself
and its opposite in one unity. Only thus is this world the difference as
difference, or difference in its own self, or difference as infinity.1                                      inner
   ¶161. Through infinity we see the law completed to necessity within itself, and all
moments of appearance taken up into the interior. That the simplicity of the law is
infinity means, according to what has emerged: (α) it is something like-itself, which is,
however, the difference in itself; or it is a like-named which repels itself from itself or
divides in two. What was called the                 simple force duplicates          itself and through its
infinity is the law. (β) The division, which constitutes the parts represented in the
law, presents itself as something subsistent; and considered without the concept
of the inner difference, then these parts, space and time, or distance and velocity,
which emerge as moments of gravity, are indifferent and without necessity for each
other, as well as for gravity itself, just as this simple gravity is indifferent to them, or
simple electricity is indifferent to positive and negative electricity. (γ) But through the
concept of the inner difference, this unlike and indifferent part, space and time, etc.,
is a difference which is no difference, or only a difference of the like-named, and its
essence is unity; as positive and negative they are inspired with regard to each other
into activity, and their Being is rather to posit themselves as not-being and to sublate
themselves in the unity. There subsist two differentiated items, they are in themselves,
they are in themselves as opposites, i.e. the opposite of themselves, they have their
other in them and are only one unity.1
   ¶162. This simple infinity, or the absolute concept, may be called the simple
essence of life, the soul of the world, the universal blood, whose omnipresence is
neither disturbed nor interrupted by any difference, but rather is itself all differences,
as also their sublatedness; so it pulsates within itself but does not move, vibrates
within itself, yet is at rest. It is like-itself, for the differences are tautological; they are
differences that are no differences. This essence like-itself is therefore related only to
its own self; to its own self, so this is an other to which the relation proceeds, and the
relating-to-itself is rather a division; or that very likeness-to-itself is inner difference.
These divided fragments are thus in and for themselves each a contrary—of an other;
so the other is at the same time announced therein together with itself. Or it is not the
contrary of an other but only the pure contrary; and so it is therefore in its own self
the contrary of itself. Or it is not a contrary at all, but purely for itself, a pure, self-like
essence that has no difference in it; so we do not need to ask the question, still less to
regard fretting over such a question as philosophy, nor even to consider it a question
---
    . 

philosophy cannot answer—the question,                     how    from this pure essence, how does
difference or otherness issue forth from it? For the division has already taken place,
the difference is excluded from the like-itself and set apart from it; what was
supposed to be the like-itself is thus already one of the divided fragments instead of
being the absolute essence. The like-itself divides itself, means, therefore, just as well:
it sublates itself as already divided, it sublates itself as otherness. The unity, of which it
is usually said that difference cannot issue from it, is in fact itself only one moment of
the division; it is the abstraction of the simplicity which confronts the difference. But
because the unity is an abstraction, only one of the opposites, it is already said that it
is the act of dividing; for if the unity is a negative, an opposite, then it is just posited as
that which has opposition in it. The differences of dividing and of becoming-like-itself
are therefore equally only           this movement of self-sublation; for since the like-itself,
which is supposed first to divide itself or become its contrary, is an abstraction or is
already itself a divided fragment, its dividing is thereby a sublation of what it is, and
therefore the sublation of its dividedness.                Becoming-like-itself        is equally an act of
dividing; what becomes
itself on one side, or rather it becomes a divided fragment. 1like itself thereby confronts the division; i.e. it thereby puts
   ¶163. Infinity, or this absolute unrest of pure self-movement, in which whatever is
determined in any way, e.g. as Being, is rather the contrary of this determinacy, has
certainly already been the soul of all that has gone before; but it is in the interior that
it has itself first come forth freely. Appearance, or the play of forces, already presents
it, but it is as explanation that it first of all steps forth freely; and since infinitude
is finally object for consciousness,             as that which it is, consciousness is thus                  self-
consciousness. The understanding’s explanation initially gives only the description of
what self-consciousness is. The understanding sublates the differences present in the
law, differences which have already become pure differences but are still indifferent,
and posits them in one unity, the force. But this becoming-like is just as immediately
a division, for the understanding sublates the differences and posits the unit of force
only by establishing a new difference, that of law and force, which, however, at the
same time is no difference; and besides the fact that this difference is likewise no
difference, the understanding itself goes on to sublate this difference again, in that it
lets the force be constituted just as the law is.—However, this movement, or necessity,
is thus still a necessity and a movement of the understanding, or the movement as
such is not its object, but in this movement the understanding has as objects positive
and negative electricity, distance, velocity, force of attraction, and a thousand other
things that constitute the content of the moments of the movement. The reason why
explaining involves so much self-satisfaction is just because in it consciousness,
engaged, as one might express it, in immediate monologue with itself, enjoys only
itself; although it seems to be occupied with something else, it is in fact preoccupied
only with itself.1
   ¶164. In the opposite law, as the inversion of the                         first law, or in the inner
difference, infinity itself does indeed become                 object of the understanding; but once
again the understanding falls short of infinity as such, since it again apportions to two
worlds, or to two substantial elements, the difference in itself, the self-repulsion of
the like-named, and the unlikes that attract each other; to the understanding, the
movement, as it is in experience, is here a happening, and the like-named and the
---
                                                          .                          

unlike are predicates, whose essence is a substrate that simply is. What is, for the
understanding, an object in a sensory covering, is for us in its essential form as a pure
concept. This apprehension of the difference as it is in truth, or the apprehension of
infinity as such, is for us, or in itself. The exposition of the concept of infinity belongs
to science; but consciousness, now that it has this concept                      immediately, comes on
the scene again as a form of its own, or as a new shape of consciousness, which does
not recognize its essence in what has gone before, but regards it as another thing
altogether.—Since this concept of infinity is an object for it, consciousness is thus
consciousness of the difference as something that is also                          immediately       sublated;
consciousness is        for its own self, it is a        differentiating of the undifferentiated, or
self-consciousness. I differentiate myself from myself, and in this it is immediately for
me that what is differentiated is not differentiated. I, the like-named, repel myself
from myself; but what is differentiated, posited as unlike, is immediately, now that
it is differentiated, no difference for me. Consciousness of an Other, of an object
in general, is of course itself necessarily             self-consciousness, reflectedness into itself,
consciousness of itself in its otherness. The                 necessary advance        from the previous
shapes of consciousness for which their true was a thing, an other than themselves,
expresses just this, that not only is consciousness of the thing possible only for a self-
consciousness, but that self-consciousness alone is the truth of those shapes. But it is
only for us that this truth is present, not yet for consciousness. But self-consciousness
has become only for itself, not yet as unity with consciousness in general. 1
    ¶165. We see that in the interior of appearance what the understanding in truth
gets to experience is nothing other than appearance itself, only not appearance as it
is as the play of forces, but rather that play of forces in its absolutely-universal
moments and in their movement, and in fact the understanding experiences only
itself. Elevated above perception, consciousness presents itself joined together with
the supersensible through the middle term of appearance, a middle term through
which it gazes into this background. The two extremes, the one, that of the pure
interior, the other, that of the interior gazing into this pure interior, have now
coincided, and just as they, as extremes, have vanished, so too the middle term, as
something other than these extremes, has also vanished. This screen in front of the
interior has therefore been drawn away, and the gaze of the interior into the interior
is at hand: the gaze of the undifferentiated like-named, which repels itself, posits itself
as differentiated interior, but for which just as immediately there is the                        undifferen-
tiatedness, self-consciousness. It turns out that behind the so-called screen which is
supposed to conceal the interior, there is nothing to be seen unless we go behind it
ourselves, not only in order that we may see, but also that there may be something
behind there that can be seen. But at the same time it emerges that we cannot go
directly behind without ceremony; for this knowledge of what is the truth of the
representation      of appearance and its interior, is itself only the result of a complex
movement whereby the modes of consciousness, meaning, perceiving, and the under-
standing, vanish; and it will likewise emerge that the cognition of what consciousness
knows when it knows itself, requires still further circumstances, the exposition of which
is what follows.1
---
        B. Self-Consciousness

        IV. The Truth of Certainty of Oneself
¶166. In the previous modes of certainty the true for consciousness is something
other than itself. But the concept of this true vanishes in the experience of it; the
object was immediately of a certain sort in itself, the being of sensory certainty, the
concrete thing of perception, the force of the understanding; but the object proves
rather not to be like that in truth; instead, this                in-itself  turns out to be a mode in
which the object is only for an other; the concept of the object sublates itself in the
actual object or the        first, immediate representation of the object sublates itself in
experience, and certainty got lost in the truth. But from now on something has arisen
that did not emerge in these previous relationships, viz. a certainty which is equal to
its truth; for the certainty is to itself its own object, and consciousness is to itself the
true. In this there is indeed an otherness too; that is to say, consciousness draws a
distinction, but one which at the same time is for consciousness a non-distinction. If
we give the name          concept    to the movement of knowing, and the name                        object  to
knowing as tranquil unity, or as I, then we see that not only for us, but for knowing
itself, the object corresponds to the concept.—Or put in the other way, if what the
object is in itself is called the concept, but what it is as object or for an other is called
the object, then it is clear that Being-in-itself and Being-for-an-other are the same; for
the in-itself is consciousness; but equally it is that for which an other (the in-itself ) is;
and it is for consciousness that the in-itself of the object, and the Being of the object
for an Other, are the same; I is the content of the relation and the relating itself;
I is I itself in contrast to an other, and at the same time it overarches this other, which,
for the I, is equally only the I itself.1
   ¶167. With self-consciousness, then, we have now entered the native realm of truth.
We have to see how the shape of self-consciousness first emerges. If we consider this
new shape of knowing, the knowing of oneself, in its relationship to the foregoing,
the knowing of an Other, then this other has indeed vanished; but its moments have
at the same time also been preserved, and the loss consists in this, that here they
are present as they are in themselves. The Being of meaning, the singularity and the
universality opposed to it of perception, as also the empty interior of the understanding,
are no longer as essences, but as moments of self-consciousness, i.e. as abstractions or
distinctions which at the same time are null for consciousness itself, or not distinctions
at all and purely vanishing essences. Thus it seems that only the principal moment itself
has been lost, viz. the simple independent subsistence for consciousness. But in fact self-
consciousness is the reflection out of the Being of the sensory and perceived world, and
essentially the return from otherness. As self-consciousness, it is movement; but since
---
                                            .                                    

it distinguishes      only itself as      itself from itself, the difference, as an otherness, is
immediately sublated          for it; the difference       is not, and     self-consciousness is only the
motionless tautology of: I am I; but since for it the difference does not have even
the shape of Being, it is not self-consciousness. Hence otherness is for it as a Being, or as
a distinct moment; but there is also for consciousness the unity of itself with this
difference as a second distinct moment. With that first moment, self-consciousness is
as consciousness, and the whole expanse of the sensory world is preserved for it, but at
the same time only as related to the second moment, the unity of self-consciousness
with itself; and herewith the sensory world is for it a subsistence which, however, is
only   appearance, or a difference which,               in itself, has no Being. This opposition of
its appearance and its truth has, however, for its essence only the truth, viz. the unity
of self-consciousness with itself; this unity must become essential to self-consciousness,
i.e. self-consciousness is         desire   in general. From now on, consciousness, as self-
consciousness, has a double object: one is the immediate object, that of sense-certainty
and perception, which however is marked for it with the character of the negative; and
the second, viz.      itself, which is the true         essence, and is present initially only in the
opposition of the first object. In this, self-consciousness presents itself as the movement
in which this opposition is sublated and the equality of itself with itself arises for it.1
   ¶168. But for us or in itself, the object which for self-consciousness is the negative
has, on its side, returned into itself, just as consciousness has done on the other side.
Through this reflection-into-itself the object has become life. What self-consciousness
distinguishes from itself as being, also has in it, insofar as it is posited as being, not
merely the mode of sensory certainty and perception, but it is Being reflected into
itself, and the object of immediate desire is a living creature. For the in-itself, or the
universal    result of the relationship of the understanding to the interior of things,
is the distinguishing of what is not to be distinguished, or the unity of what is
distinguished. But this unity is, as we have seen, just as much its repulsion from
itself; and this concept divides           itself into the opposition of self-consciousness and
life: the former is the unity           for which      the infinite unity of the differences is; the
latter, however, is only this unity itself, so that it is not at the same time for itself. To
the extent, then, that consciousness is independent, so too is its object independent
in itself. Self-consciousness which is simply                  for itself   and immediately marks its
object with the character of the negative, or is initially desire, will therefore rather
undergo the experience of the object’s independence. 1
   ¶169. The determination of life as it emerges from the concept or from the uni-
versal result with which we enter this sphere, is sufficient to characterize it without
developing its nature from that any further; the circle of this determination completes
itself in the following moments. The                  essence   is infinity as the       sublatedness      of all
differences, the pure movement of axial rotation, the repose of this infinity as abso-
lutely restless infinity; independence itself, in which the differences of the movement are
resolved; the simple essence of time which, in this equality-with-itself, has the solid
shape of space. But in this simple universal medium, the differences are just as much
differences, for this universal fluidity has its negative nature only in being a sublation of
these differences; but it cannot sublate the items differentiated if they do not have a
subsistence. It is just this         fluidity, as independence equal-to-itself, which is itself
the  subsistence or the substance of these differences, in which they are therefore as
---
    . -

differentiated members and parts that                 are for-themselves.        Being   no longer has the
significance of the abstraction of Being, nor has their pure essentiality the significance
of the abstraction of universality; rather, their Being is just that simple fluid substance
of pure movement within itself. The difference, however, of these members with respect
to one another, as difference,           consists in general in no other determinacy                   than the
determinacy of the moments of infinity or of the pure movement itself.1
   ¶170. The independent members are for themselves; but this Being-for-self is really
just as immediately their reflection into the unity as this unity is the division into
independent shapes. The unity is divided because it is absolutely negative or infinite
unity; and because this unity is the subsistence, the difference, too, has independence
only   in it. This independence of the shape appears as something determinate,                                 for
another, for the shape is a product of division; and the                        sublation     of the division
accordingly takes place through an other. But this sublation is just as much within the
shape itself, for it is just that fluidity that is the substance of the independent shapes;
but this substance is infinite, and so the shape in its very subsistence is division, or the
sublation of its Being-for-itself.1
   ¶171. If we distinguish more exactly the moments contained here, we see that we
have, as the first moment, the subsistence of the independent shapes, or the suppres-
sion of what the differentiating is in itself, namely, not to be in itself and to have no
subsistence. The second moment, however, is the subjugation of that subsistence to
the infinity of the difference. In the first moment there is the subsistent shape; as
being-for-itself, or in its determinacy infinite substance, it emerges in opposition to
the universal substance, disowns this fluidity and continuity with it and asserts itself
as not dissolved in this universal, but rather as preserving itself by separation from
this its inorganic nature, and by consuming it. Life in the universal fluid medium, a
calm deployment of the shapes, becomes, just by so doing, the movement of those
shapes or becomes life as process. The simple universal fluidity is the                          in-itself, and
the difference of the shapes is the             Other. But this fluidity itself becomes               the other
through this difference; for now it is for the difference, which is in and for itself, and
consequently is the infinite movement by which this calm medium is consumed: life
as a living thing.—This inversion, however, is for that reason again an invertedness in
its own self; what is consumed is the essence; the individuality which maintains itself
at the expense of the universal and gives itself the feeling of its unity with itself, just by
so doing sublates its opposition with the Other, the opposition through which it is for
itself; the unity with itself that it gives to itself is just the fluidity of the differences or
the universal dissolution. But conversely, the sublation of the individual subsistence is
equally the generation of it. For since the essence of the individual shape is universal
life, and what is-for-itself is in itself simple substance, when what is-for-itself posits
the other within itself it sublates this its              simplicity    or its essence, i.e. it divides it,
and this division of the undifferentiated fluidity is just the positing of individuality.
Thus the simple substance of life is the division of itself into shapes and at the same
time the dissolution of these subsistent differences; and the dissolution of the division
is just as much division or an articulation of members. With this, the two sides of the
whole movement which were distinguished, viz. the calmly deployed shaping in
the universal medium of independence, and the process of life, collapse into one
another; the latter is just as much a shaping as it is the sublation of shape; and the
---
                                            .                                    

former, the shaping, is just as much a sublation as it is shaping. The                          fluid element
is itself only the      abstraction     of the essence, or it is          actual   only as shape; and its
articulation of itself into members is again a division of what is articulated or a
dissolution of it. It is this whole cycle that constitutes life: not what was expressed at
the outset, the immediate continuity and solidity of its essence, nor the subsistent
shape and the discrete being for itself, nor the pure process of these, nor even the
simple combination of these moments, but rather the whole that develops itself and
dissolves its development and in this movement simply maintains itself.1
   ¶172. Since we start from the                 first immediate unity and return through the
moments of shaping and of process to the unity of these two moments, and thus
back again to the first simple substance, this reflected unity is different from the first
unity. In contrast to that immediate unity, or unity expressed as a Being, this second
unity is the universal unity which has in it all these moments as sublated. It is the
simple genus which, in the movement of life itself, does not exist for itself as this simple;
rather, in this result, life points to something other than itself, viz. to consciousness,
for which life is as this unity, or as genus.1
   ¶173. This other life, however, for which the genus as such is, and which is genus
for its own self, self-consciousness, is initially to itself only as this simple essence, and
has itself as pure I for object; in its experience, which we are now to consider, this
abstract object will enrich itself for self-consciousness and undergo the unfolding
which we have seen in life.1
   ¶174. The simple I is this genus or the simple universal, for which the differences
are no differences, but only by its being the negative essence of the shaped independ-
ent moments; and self-consciousness is thus certain of itself only by sublating this
other that presents itself to self-consciousness as independent life; self-consciousness
is desire. Certain of the nothingness of this other, it posits this nothingness for itself
as its truth, annihilates the independent object and thereby gives itself the certainty
of itself as true certainty, as the sort of certainty that has arisen for it in an objective
manner1.
   ¶175. In this satisfaction, however, self-consciousness undergoes the experience
of the independence of its object. Desire and the self-certainty obtained in the
satisfaction of desire are conditioned by the object, for self-certainty comes from
sublating this other; for there to be this sublation, there must be this Other. Thus self-
consciousness cannot sublate the object by its negative relation to it; because of that it
instead generates the object again, and the desire as well. It is in fact something other
than self-consciousness that is the essence of desire; and through this experience this
truth has dawned on self-consciousness itself. But at the same time self-consciousness
is no less absolutely for itself, and it is so only by sublating the object; and it must get
its satisfaction, for it is the truth. Owing to the independence of the object, therefore,
self-consciousness can achieve satisfaction only when the object itself effects the
negation within itself; and it must effect this negation of itself in itself, for it is in itself
the negative, and must be for the other what it is. Since the object is negation in its
own self, and yet is at the same time independent, it is consciousness. In life, which is
the object of desire, negation is either in an other, viz. in desire, or as a determinacy
confronting another indifferent shape, or as life’s inorganic universal nature. But this
universal independent nature in which negation is as absolute negation, is the genus
---
    . -

as such, or as       self-consciousness.      Self-consciousness achieves its satisfaction only in
another self-consciousness1.
   ¶176. The        concept      of   self-consciousness         is  only    completed       in   these  three
moments: (a) the pure undifferentiated I is its                   first immediate object; (b) but this
immediacy is itself an absolute mediation, it is only as a sublation of the independ-
ent object, or it is desire. The satisfaction of desire is of course the reflection of self-
consciousness into itself, or the certainty that has become truth; and (c) but the truth
of this certainty is really a double reflection, the duplication of self-consciousness.
There is for consciousness an object which, in its own Self, posits its otherness or
posits the difference as a null difference, and in so doing is independent. The
differentiated, merely         living, shape does indeed also sublate its independence in
the process of life itself, but it ceases with its difference to be what it is; but the object
of self-consciousness is just as independent in this negativity of itself; and thus it is
for itself genus, universal fluidity in the peculiarity of its isolation; it is living self-
consciousness.1
   ¶177. There is a        self-consciousness for a self-consciousness. Only so is it in fact
self-consciousness; for only in this way does the unity of itself in its otherness come
to be for it;    I, which is the object of its concept, is in fact not object; the object of
desire, however, is only independent, for it is the universal indestructible substance,
the fluid essence equal-to-its-own-self. When a self-consciousness is the object, the
object is just as much I as object.—With this, we already have before us the concept of
spirit. What still lies ahead for consciousness is the experience of what spirit is, this
absolute substance which, in the perfect freedom and independence of its opposition,
viz. of diverse self-consciousnesses that are for themselves, is the unity of these self-
consciousnesses: I that is We, and We that is I. It is in self-consciousness, as the concept
of spirit, that consciousness           first has its turning-point, where it leaves behind the
colourful semblance of the sensory here-and-now and the empty night of the super-
sensible Beyond, and steps out into the spiritual day of presence.1
A. Independence and dependence of self-consciousness:
lordship and bondage
¶178. Self-consciousness is in and for itself, when, and by the fact that, it is in and for
itself for another self-consciousness; that is, it is only as something recognized. The
concept of this its unity in its duplication, of the infinity realizing itself in self-
consciousness, is a many-sided and ambiguous interlacing, so that the moments of
this unity must on the one hand be kept strictly apart, and on the other hand must in
this differentiation at the same time also be taken and cognized as not distinct, or
always in their opposite significance. The twofold sense of the distinct moments lies
in the essence of self-consciousness, which is to be infinite, or immediately the
contrary of the determinacy in which it is posited. The explication of the concept
of this spiritual unity in its duplication presents to us the movement of recognition.1
   ¶179. There is for self-consciousness another self-consciousness; it has come out of
itself. This has a twofold significance: first, it has lost itself, for it finds itself as an other
essence; secondly, in doing so it has sublated the other, for it does not see the other as
an essence either, but in the other sees its own self.1
---
                                            .                                   

   ¶180. It must sublate this otherness of itself; this is the sublation of the first double
sense, and is therefore itself a second double sense; first, it must proceed to sublate the
other independent essence in order thereby to become certain of itself as the essence;
secondly, in so doing it proceeds to sublate its own self, for this other is itself. 1
   ¶181. This ambiguous sublation of its ambiguous otherness is equally an ambigu-
ous return into itself; for first, through the sublation, it receives back its own self, for
by sublating its otherness it again becomes equal to itself; but secondly, it equally gives
the other self-consciousness back to it again, for it found itself in the other, it sublates
this Being of itself in the other, thus lets the other again go free. 1
   ¶182. But this movement of self-consciousness in relation to another self-consciousness
has in this way been represented as                 the doing of one        of the self-consciousnesses;
but this doing of the one has itself the double significance of being both                              its own
doing and the doing of the other as well; for the other is equally independent, closed
within itself, and there is nothing in it of which it is not itself the origin. The first self-
consciousness does not have the object before it as the object initially is only for
desire, but an independent object that is for itself, to which, therefore, it can do
nothing for itself, if that object does not do in its own self what the first does to it.
Thus the movement is simply the double movement of the two self-consciousnesses.
Each sees     the other do the same as it does; each does itself what it requires of the
other, and therefore also does what it does only insofar as the other does the same;
one-sided doing would be useless because what is supposed to happen can only come
about through both.1
   ¶183. Thus the doing has a double sense not only because it is directed on itself
as well as on the other, but also because it is inseparably the doing of the one as well as
of the other. 1
   ¶184. In this movement we see repeated the process which presented itself as a
play of forces, but repeated in consciousness. What, in that play, was for us, is here for
the extremes themselves. The middle term is self-consciousness which splits into the
extremes; and each extreme is this exchanging of its determinacy and absolute
transition into the opposite determinacy. But, as consciousness, it does indeed
come    outside itself, yet, in its Being-outside-itself, it is at the same time kept back
within itself, for itself, and its outside-itself is for it. It is for it that it immediately is,
and is not, another consciousness; and equally that this other is for itself only when it
sublates itself as a being-for-itself, and is for itself only in the Being-for-itself of the
other. Each is to the other the middle term, through which each mediates itself with
itself and joins together with itself, and each is to itself, and to the other, an
immediate essence that is for itself, which at the same time is for itself only through
this mediation. They recognize themselves as mutually recognizing one another.1
   ¶185. This pure concept of recognition, of the duplicating of self-consciousness
in its unity, now has to be considered, to see how its process appears for self-
consciousness. At         first, the process will present the side of the                 inequality     of the
two, or the bifurcation of the middle term into the extremes which, as extremes, are
opposed to one another, one being only recognized, the other only recognizing.1
   ¶186. Self-consciousness is initially simple Being-for-itself, equal-to-its-own-self
through the exclusion from itself of everything else; its essence and absolute object is,
to it, I; and in this immediacy or in this Being of its Being-for-itself, it is a singleton.

What is other for it is as an unessential object, marked with the character of the
negative. But the other is also a self-consciousness; an individual comes face to
face with an individual. Entering the scene                  immediately       in this way, they are for
one another in the manner of ordinary objects; independent shapes, consciousnesses
submerged in the Being of life—for here the object that is determines itself as life—,
consciousnesses that have not yet accomplished                      for each other       the movement of
absolute abstraction, of eradicating all immediate Being, and of being merely the
purely negative Being of consciousness equal-to-itself, or have not as yet presented
themselves to each other as pure Being-for-itself, that is, as self-consciousnesses. Each
is indeed certain of its own self, but not of the other, and therefore its own certainty of
itself still has no truth; for its truth would be only that its own Being-for-itself had
presented itself to it as an independent object, or, what is the same thing, that the
object had presented itself as this pure certainty of itself. But according to the concept
of recognition this is not possible, unless each of these objects accomplishes this pure
abstraction of Being-for-itself, the one for the other, just as the other for the one, each
in itself by its own doing and again by the doing of the other.1
    ¶187. But the       presentation     of itself as the pure abstraction of self-consciousness
consists in showing itself as the pure negation of its objective mode, or in showing
that it is not attached to any determinate Being-there, not to the universal singularity
of Being-there in general, not attached to life. This presentation is the twofold doing:
doing of the other, and doing through its own self. Insofar as it is the doing of the
other, so each aims at the death of the other. But in this the second doing is also
present, the doing through its own self; for the former involves the staking of its own
life. Thus the relationship of the two self-consciousnesses is determined in such a way
that they prove themselves and each other through a life-and-death combat.—They
must engage in this combat, for they must elevate their certainty of themselves,
certainty of being for themselves, to the truth, in the other and in themselves. And it is
only through staking one’s life that freedom is established, that it is proved that to
self-consciousness the essence is not               Being, not the       immediate      mode in which it
comes on the scene, not its submergence in the expansion of life,—but rather that
there is nothing present in it which would not be a vanishing moment for it, that it is
only pure      Being-for-itself. The individual who has not risked his life may well be
recognized as a        person; but it has not attained to the truth of this recognition as
recognition of an independent self-consciousness. Similarly, as each stakes its life, so
each must aim at the other’s death; for it values the other no more than itself; its
essence presents itself to it as an other, it is outside itself and must sublate its Being-
outside-itself; the other is a manifoldly entangled consciousness that simply is; it
must intuit its otherness as pure Being-for-itself or as absolute negation.1
    ¶188. However, this trial by death sublates the truth which was supposed to issue
from it, just as it thereby also sublates the certainty of itself in general; for as life is the
natural     position of consciousness, independence without absolute negativity, so
death is the       natural    negation of consciousness, negation without independence,
which thus remains without the required significance of recognition. Death has
indeed given rise to the certainty that both of them staked their life and scorned
it, in themselves and in the other; but not for those who endured this combat.
They sublate their consciousness posited in this alien essentiality, which is natural
---
                                           .                              

Being-there, or they sublate themselves, and are sublated as extremes wanting to be
for themselves. But with this there vanishes from the play of exchange the essential
moment, that of decomposing into extremes with opposite determinacies; and the
middle term collapses into a dead unity which is decomposed into dead, unopposed
extremes that simply are; and the two do not reciprocally give and receive themselves
back from each other through consciousness, but leave each other free only indiffer-
ently, as things. Their deed is abstract negation, not the negation of consciousness,
which sublates in such a way as to preserve and maintain what is sublated, and thereby
survives its being sublated.1
    ¶189. In this experience, it dawns on self-consciousness that life is as essential to it
as pure self-consciousness. In immediate self-consciousness the simple I is the absolute
object, which, however, is for us or in itself the absolute mediation and has as its
essential moment subsistent independence. The dissolution of that simple unity is the
result of the first experience; through this there is posited a pure self-consciousness,
and a consciousness which is not purely for itself but for another, i.e. is as conscious-
ness that     is, or consciousness in the shape of               thinghood. The two moments are
essential;—since initially they are unequal and opposed, and their reflection into
unity has not yet ensued, they are as two opposed shapes of consciousness; one is
the independent consciousness for which the essence is Being-for-itself, the other is the
dependent consciousness for which the essence is life or Being for another; the former
is the lord, the latter is the bondsman. 1
    ¶190. The lord is the consciousness that is for itself, no longer merely the concept
of such a consciousness. Rather, it is a consciousness that is for itself, which is
mediated with itself through another consciousness, namely, through a conscious-
ness to whose essence it belongs to be synthesized with independent                              Being  or
thinghood in general. The lord gets into relation with these two moments, to a
thing as such, the object of desire, and to the consciousness for which thinghood is
what is essential; and since he is (a) as concept of self-consciousness, immediate
relation of Being-for-itself, but (b) from now on, at the same time, as mediation, or as
a Being-for-itself which is for itself only through another, he is related (a) immedi-
ately to both, and (b) mediately to each through the other. The lord relates himself
mediately to the bondsman through independent Being, for it is just this which holds
the bondsman; it is his chain from which he could not abstract in the combat, thus
proving to be dependent, to have his independence in thinghood. But the lord is the
power over this Being, for he proved in the combat that it counts for him only as
something negative; since he is the power over this, while this Being is the power
over the other, in this syllogism he thus has the other under him. Equally, the lord
relates himself mediately to the thing through the bondsman; the bondsman, as self-
consciousness in general, also relates himself negatively to the thing, and sublates it;
but at the same time the thing is independent for the bondsman, and he therefore
cannot through his negating have done with it to the point of annihilation, or he only
works on it. For the lord, by contrast, there comes about through this mediation the
immediate relation as the sheer negation of the thing, or enjoyment; he succeeds in
doing, what desire failed to do: in having done with it, and satisfying himself in
enjoyment. Desire failed in this because of the thing’s independence; but the lord,
who has interposed the bondsman between it and himself, thereby joins together
---
     . -

only with the dependence of the thing and enjoys it purely; as for the side of
independence he leaves that to the bondsman, who works on the thing.1
    ¶191. In these two moments recognition comes about for the lord through
another consciousness; for this other consciousness posits itself in these moments
as something unessential,           first in working on the thing, and secondly in depend-
ency on a determinate Being-there; in neither moment can it become master over
Being and attain to absolute negation. Thus there is present here this moment of
recognition, in which the other consciousness sublates itself as Being-for-itself, and
thereby itself does what the first does to it. Likewise the other moment, that this
doing of the second is the first’s own doing; for what the bondsman does is really
the doing of the lord; to the lord alone belongs Being-for-itself, the essence; he is
the pure negative power for which the thing is nothing, and thus the pure, essential
doing in this relationship; to the bondsman belongs a doing that is not pure, but
unessential. But for recognition proper the moment is lacking, that what the lord
does to the other he should also do to himself, and what the bondsman does to
himself he should also do to the other. What has thereby arisen is a recognition
that is one-sided and unequal.1
    ¶192. In this, the unessential consciousness is for the lord the object, which
constitutes the truth        of certainty of himself. But it is clear that this object does not
correspond to its concept, but rather that there, where the lord has fulfilled himself,
he finds something quite other than an independent consciousness. What is for him
is not an independent consciousness, but a dependent one; therefore, he is not certain
of Being-for-itself     as the truth, but his truth is rather the unessential consciousness
and its unessential doing.1
    ¶193. The       truth   of the independent consciousness is accordingly the                         servile
consciousness. This servile consciousness does indeed appear initially outside of itself
and not as the truth of self-consciousness. But just as lordship showed that its essence
is the inverse of what it wants to be, so too servitude in its consummation will really
turn into the contrary of what it immediately is; as a consciousness driven back into
itself, it will withdraw into itself and be converted into true independence.1
    ¶194. We have seen what servitude is only in relationship to lordship. But it is self-
consciousness, and accordingly we have now to consider what it is in and for itself.
Initially, for servitude the lord is the essence; hence the independent consciousness
that is for itself is its truth, a truth, however, that for it is not yet within it. But it does
in fact   have within itself this truth of pure negativity and                 Being-for-itself, for it has
experienced this essence within it. That is to say, this consciousness has had anxiety,
not about this or that and not just at odd moments, but anxiety for its whole essence;
for it has felt the fear of death, of the absolute lord. In this it has been internally
dissolved, has trembled through and through within itself, and everything fixed has
quaked in it. But this pure universal movement, the absolute liquidization of all
subsistence, is the simple essence of self-consciousness, absolute negativity,                            pure
Being-for-itself, which is thus            within    this consciousness. This moment of pure
Being-for-itself is also for it, for in the lord this moment is its object. Furthermore,
this consciousness is not only this universal dissolution in general, but in its service it
accomplishes it actually; in serving it sublates its attachment to natural Being-there in
all singular moments; and gets rid of this Being-there by working on it.1
---
                                            .                                   

   ¶195. However, the feeling of absolute power in general, and in the singularity of
service, is only dissolution           in itself, and although the fear of the lord is indeed
the beginning of wisdom, in this the consciousness is for it itself, not Being-for-itself.
Through work, however, it comes to its own self. In the moment which corresponds to
desire in the lord’s consciousness, the side of unessential relation to the thing did seem
to have fallen to the lot of the serving consciousness, since in that relation the thing
retains its independence. Desire has reserved to itself the pure negating of the object
and thereby unalloyed self-feeling. But for that reason this satisfaction is itself only a
disappearance, for it lacks the objective side or subsistence. Work, by contrast, is desire
held in check,     fleetingness staved off, or work           cultivates. The negative relation to the
object becomes its         form   and something         permanent, because it is precisely for the
worker that the object has independence. This negative middle term or the formative
doing is at the same time the singularity or the pure Being-for-itself of consciousness,
which now, in working, steps outside itself into the element of permanence; in this way,
therefore, the working consciousness arrives at the intuition of independent Being as
of its own self1.
   ¶196. However, the forming does not only have this positive significance that in it
the serving consciousness, as pure Being-for-itself, becomes a being in its own eyes;
the forming also has a negative significance in the face of its first moment, fear. For,
in cultivating the thing, the serving consciousness’s own negativity, its Being-for-
itself, becomes an object for it only through its sublating the being, the form, opposed
to it. But this objective negative is just the alien essence before which it has trembled.
Now, however, it destroys this alien negative, posits itself                    as such a negative in the
element of permanence, and thereby becomes for itself a being-for-itself. In the lord,
the Being-for-itself is an other to it, or only for it; in fear, the Being-for-itself is within
it itself; in its cultivating, the Being-for-itself becomes for it as its own Being-for-itself,
and it arrives at the consciousness that it itself is in and for itself. The form is posited
outside,    but is not regarded as thereby becoming something other than serving
consciousness; for it is precisely this form that is its pure Being-for-itself, which in
this externality is seen by it to be the truth. Through this rediscovery of itself by itself,
the serving consciousness realizes that it is precisely in its labour, wherein it seemed
to have only an alienated mind, that it acquires a mind of its own.—For this reflection,
the two moments of fear and of service in general, as also that of cultivating, are
necessary, and both at the same time in a universal mode. Without the discipline of
service and obedience, fear remains a formality and does not extend to the conscious
actuality of Being-there. Without the cultivating, fear remains inward and mute,
and consciousness does not become for it itself. If consciousness forms the thing
without that initial absolute fear, it is only a vain mind of its own; for its form or
negativity is not negativity           in itself; and therefore its forming cannot give it the
consciousness of itself as the essence. If it has not endured absolute fear but only
some anxiety, the negative essence has remained for it something external, its
substance has not been infected by it through and through. Since not all acquisi-
tions of its natural consciousness have been shaken, it still belongs                              in itself   to
determinate Being; a mind of one’s own is self-will, a freedom that is still enmeshed
in servitude. As little as the pure form can become the essence for it, just as little is
that form, regarded as expansion over the singular, a universal forming, an absolute

concept; rather it is a skill that is master over a few things, but not over the
universal power and the whole objective essence.1
B. Freedom of self-consciousness: stoicism, scepticism, and the
unhappy consciousness
¶197. For the independent self-consciousness, on the one hand its essence is only
the pure abstraction of the I, and on the other hand, when this abstraction develops
and acquires differences, this differentiation does not become an objective essence
that is in itself; so this self-consciousness does not become an I that in its simplicity
is genuinely self-differentiating, or that in this absolute differentiation remains
identical with itself. By contrast, the consciousness that is driven back into itself
becomes, in the act of forming, its own object as form of the thing it has cultivated,
and in the lord it intuits at the same time Being-for-itself as consciousness. But for
the subservient consciousness as such, these two moments—that of itself                           as inde-
pendent object, and that of this object as a consciousness, and hence its own
essence—fall apart. Since, however, the form and the                   Being-for-itself are for us, or
in themselves, the same, and since in the concept of the independent consciousness
the Being-in-itself is consciousness, the side of Being-in-itself or thinghood, which
received the form in the labour, is no other substance than consciousness, and a
new shape of self-consciousness has arisen for us; a consciousness which, as the
infinitude or the pure movement of consciousness, is aware of itself as the essence;
a consciousness that         thinks   or is free self-consciousness. For to             think   means to
be one’s own object not as           abstract I, but as an I that has at the same time the
significance of Being-in-itself, of having itself for object, or of relating itself to the
objective essence in such a way that it has the significance of the Being-for-itself of
the consciousness for which it is.—For                 thinking, the object does not move in
representations or shapes, but in            concepts, i.e. in a distinct Being-in-itself, which
immediately, for consciousness, is not at all distinct from it. What is represented,
shaped, a    being, has, as such, the form of being something other than conscious-
ness; but a concept is at the same time a being, and this difference, insofar as it is
in the concept itself, is its determinate content,—but since this content is at the
same time a content conceptualized, consciousness remains                            immediately       con-
scious of its unity with this determinate and differentiated being, not, as in the
case of representation, where consciousness still has specifically to remind itself
that this is    its  representation; whereas the concept is for me immediately                          my
concept. In thinking, I am free, because I am not in an other, but remain simply
together with myself, and the object, which is for me the essence, is in undivided
unity my Being-for-myself; and my movement in concepts is a movement within
myself.—But in this determination of this shape of self-consciousness it is
essential to keep in mind that this shape is                  thinking    consciousness       in general,
or its object is     immediate      unity of     Being-in-itself    and    Being-for-itself. The con-
sciousness homonymous with itself that repels itself from itself becomes to itself
an element that is in-itself; but at         first it is to itself this element only as universal
essence in general, not as this objective essence in the development and move-
ment of its manifold Being.1

   ¶198. This freedom of self-consciousness, when it emerged as its conscious
appearance in the history of spirit, was, as we know, called Stoicism. Its principle is
that consciousness is thinking essence, and that something has essentiality for
consciousness, or is true and good for it, only as consciousness comports itself therein
as thinking essence.1
   ¶199. The manifold expansion of life, differentiating itself within itself, the singu-
larization and complication of life, is the object on which desire and labour are active.
This manifold doing has now contracted into the simple differentiating which occurs
in the pure movement of thinking. What has more essentiality is not the difference
that presents itself as determinate thing, or as consciousness of a determinate natural
Being-there, as a feeling, or as desire and purpose for this desire, whether this purpose
is set by one’s own consciousness or by an alien consciousness, but only the difference
that is a thought difference, or is immediately not distinct from me. This conscious-
ness is consequently negative towards the relationship of lordship and bondage; its
doing is, in lordship, not to have its truth in the bondsman, nor, as bondsman, to
have its truth in the will of the lord and in his service, but to be free, whether on the
throne or in chains, in all the dependency of its singular Being-there, and to maintain
for itself the lifelessness that constantly             withdraws      from the movement of Being-
there, from activity as well as from suffering, into the simple essentiality of thought.
Self-will is the freedom that fastens onto a singularity and stands                        within   bondage,
while Stoicism is the freedom that always comes immediately out of bondage and
back into the      pure universality        of thought. As universal form of the world-spirit,
Stoicism could only emerge in a time of universal fear and bondage, but also in the
time of a universal culture that had elevated cultivation up to thinking.1
   ¶200. Now, it is true that for this self-consciousness the essence is neither an other
than itself, nor the pure abstraction of the I; the essence is I, which has otherness in it,
but as a difference in thought, so that in its otherness the I has immediately returned
into itself. Yet at the same time this essence of self-consciousness is only an abstract
essence. The freedom of self-consciousness is indifferent to natural Being-there, has
therefore likewise let this Being-there go free, and the reflection is a double reflection.
Freedom in thought has only pure thought as its truth, a truth without the fullness of
life; and so it is also only the concept of freedom, not living freedom itself; for the
essence of that freedom is at first only thinking in general, the form as such, which has
turned away from the independence of things and returned into itself. But since the
singularity, as acting, should present itself as full of life or, as thinking, should grasp
the living world as a system of thought, there would have to reside in thought itself a
content, for the expansion of action a content of what is good, for the expansion of
thinking a content of what is true, in order that in what is for consciousness there
should be no other ingredient             whatsoever      except the concept which is the essence.
But here the concept as abstraction cuts itself off from the multiplicity of things, and
so it has    no content in itself       but a content given to it. Consciousness does indeed
eliminate the content as an alien Being, when it thinks it; but the concept is a
determinate      concept, and this determinacy of the concept is the alien element that
it has in it. Stoicism therefore got into difficulties when it was asked, as they expressed
it, for the criterion of truth in general, i.e. strictly speaking, for a content of thought
itself. To the question put to it, what is good and true, it again gave in answer the
---
     . -

contentless thinking itself: the true and the good shall consist in rationality. But this
equality of thinking with itself is again only the pure form in which nothing is
determined; the true and the good, wisdom and virtue, the universal words at
which Stoicism has to come to a standstill, are therefore no doubt uplifting in general,
but since they cannot in fact come to any expansion of the content, they soon begin to
generate boredom.1
    ¶201. This thinking consciousness, in the way in which it has determined itself as
abstract freedom, is thus only the incomplete negation of otherness; withdrawn from
Being-there only into itself, it has not accomplished itself as absolute negation of
Being-there in it. The content, it is true, for it counts only as thought, but also as
determinate thought, and at the same time as determinacy as such. 1
    ¶202. Scepticism is the realization of that of which Stoicism is only the concept,—
and the actual experience of what freedom of thought is; this freedom is in itself the
negative and must display itself as such. With the reflection of self-consciousness into
the simple thought of itself, the independent Being-there or the permanent deter-
minacy has, vis-à-vis that reflection, in fact fallen outside of the infinitude [of
thought]; in Scepticism the entire inessentiality and dependence of this other
now comes before consciousness; thought becomes the complete thinking that anni-
hilates the Being of the multiply determined world, and the negativity of free self-
consciousness becomes for itself real negativity in this manifold configuration of
life.—It is clear that just as Stoicism corresponds to the concept                     of the independent
consciousness, which appeared as the relationship of mastery and bondage, so
Scepticism corresponds to the              realization    of this concept as the negative attitude
towards otherness, as desire and labour. But if desire and labour were unable to effect
the negation for self-consciousness, this polemical attitude towards the multiple
independence of things will, by contrast, meet with success, because it turns against
them as free self-consciousness that is already complete within itself; more specific-
ally, because this attitude has, within its own self, thinking or infinitude, and in this
the independencies in their difference are for it only vanishing magnitudes. The
differences, which in the pure thinking of itself are only the abstraction of differences,
here become all the differences, and all differentiated Being becomes a difference of
self-consciousness.1
    ¶203. In this way what scepticism does in general, and the manner in which it does
it, has determined itself. Scepticism exhibits the dialectical movement which sensory
certainty, perception, and the understanding are; it also exhibits the unessentiality of
what counts, in the relationship of lordship and service, and what counts for abstract
thinking itself, as something           determinate. This relationship at the same time com-
prises within itself a        determinate mode         in which ethical laws, too, are present as
commands of mastery; but the determinations in abstract thinking are concepts of
science into which contentless thinking spreads itself, attaching the concept in a way
that is in fact merely external to the Being that is independent for it and constitutes its
content, and regards as valid only determinate concepts, even though they are also
pure abstractions.1
    ¶204. The dialectical as negative movement, in the way it immediately is, initially
appears to consciousness as something to which it is surrendered, and which is not
engendered by consciousness itself. As Scepticism, on the other hand, this movement
---
                                            .                                    

is a moment of self-consciousness, to which it does not happen that what is for it the
true and the real vanish without its knowing how, but which, in the certainty of its
freedom, itself makes this other ostensible reality vanish. Self-consciousness causes
to vanish not only the objective as such, but its own attitude to it, in which it counts
as objective and is made valid, hence, too, its perceiving is made to vanish, along with
its reinforcement       of what it is in danger of losing,              sophistry, and the        truth   it has
determined      and    established from its own resources. Through this self-conscious
negation self-consciousness procures for itself the certainty of its freedom, produces
the experience of that certitude, and thereby elevates it to truth. What vanishes is the
determinate, or the difference, which, in whatever way and whatever its source,
establishes itself as fixed and immutable. This difference has nothing permanent in
it, and   must    vanish for thinking, because the different is just this, not to be                         self-
contained, but to have its essentiality only in an other; but thinking is the insight into
this nature of the different, it is the negative essence, as simple.1
   ¶205. In the variability of all that would stabilize itself before it, the sceptical self-
consciousness thus experiences its own freedom as given to it by itself and preserved
by itself. It is for itself this ataraxia of thinking that thinks itself, the unchanging and
genuine certainty of itself. This certainty does not issue from something alien,
compressing its complex development within itself, as a result which would leave
its coming-to-be behind it; no, consciousness itself is the absolute dialectical unrest,
this melange of sensory and thought representations whose differences coincide, and
whose equality likewise dissolves in turn—for equality is itself the                          determinacy      in
contrast to the unequal. But it is precisely here that this consciousness, instead of
being consciousness equal-to-itself, is in fact just an utterly contingent confusion, the
vertigo of a perpetually self-engendering disorder. It is this for itself; for consciousness
itself maintains and produces this confusion in motion. That is why it also confesses
to it, it confesses to being a wholly contingent, singular consciousness,—a conscious-
ness which is empirical, takes its guidance from what has no reality for it, obeys what
is for it no essence, does and brings to actuality what has no truth for it. But equally,
while it evaluates itself in this way as singular, contingent and, in fact, animal life, and
lost self-consciousness, it also, on the contrary, makes itself again into a conscious-
ness that is universal and equal to itself; for it is the negativity of all singularity and all
difference. From this equality-to-itself, or rather within this equality-to-itself, it falls
back again into this contingency and confusion, for this self-moving negativity has to
do solely with what is singular, and gallivants with the contingent. This conscious-
ness is therefore the unconscious rambling, passing back and forth from the one
extreme of self-consciousness, equal-to-itself, to the other extreme of the contingent
consciousness that is confused and confusing. It does not itself bring these two
thoughts of itself together;         at one time it recognizes its freedom as elevation above
all the confusion and all the contingency of Being-there, and at another time likewise
confesses to a relapse into inessentiality and to gallivanting in it. It lets the unessential
content in its thinking vanish, but in this very act it is the consciousness of something
unessential; it pronounces absolute               vanishing, but the        pronouncement         is, and this
consciousness is the vanishing pronounced; it pronounces the nullity of seeing,
hearing, etc., and it itself sees, hears, etc; it pronounces the nullity of ethical essenti-
alities, and makes these same essentialities the powers of its action. Its doings and its

words always contradict each other, and likewise it itself has the double contradictory
consciousness of unchangeableness and equality, and of utter contingency and
inequality with itself. But it keeps the poles of this contradiction of itself apart, and
adopts the same attitude to it as it does in its purely negative movement in general.
Point out equality to it, and it points out inequality; and when it is now confronted
with the inequality it has just pronounced, it switches to pointing out equality; its
chatter is in fact a squabble of self-willed children, one of whom says A if the other
says B, and in turn says B if the other says A, and who by contradicting themselves
purchase the pleasure of remaining in contradiction with each other.1
   ¶206. In Scepticism, consciousness experiences itself in truth as a consciousness
contradictory within itself; from this experience emerges a new shape, which brings
together the two thoughts which Scepticism holds apart. Scepticism’s thoughtlessness
about itself must vanish, because it is in fact one consciousness which has these two
modes in it. This new shape is thereby one which is for itself the double conscious-
ness, of itself as self-liberating, unchangeable, and equal to itself, and of itself as
self-confusing and self-inverting, and the consciousness of this its contradiction.—
In Stoicism, self-consciousness is the simple freedom of itself; in Scepticism, this
freedom realizes itself, annihilates the other side of determinate Being-there, but
more exactly duplicates itself, and is now to itself something twofold. In this way
the duplication which earlier was divided between two singletons, the lord and the
bondsman, has now settled in one; with this, the duplication of self-consciousness
within itself, which is essential in the concept of spirit, is present, but not yet its unity,
and the     unhappy consciousness is the consciousness of itself as the double, merely
contradictory essence.1
   ¶207. This      unhappy, internally split consciousness, since this contradiction of its
essence is to itself one consciousness, must always have in the one consciousness the
other consciousness too, and so it must immediately be driven out of each of them
again, as soon as it thinks it has arrived at victory and the repose of unity. But its true
return into itself, or its reconciliation with itself, will display the concept of spirit, the
spirit that has become alive and entered into existence, because this is already in it—
that as one undivided consciousness it is a duplicated consciousness: it itself is the
gazing of one self-consciousness into another, and it itself                    is both, and the unity of
both is also to it the essence; but for itself it is not yet this essence itself, not yet the
unity of the two self-consciousnesses.1
   ¶208. Since it is initially only the immediate unity of the two, but for it the two are
not the same, but opposed, one of them, namely the simple unchangeable, is to it as
the essence; but the other, the multiple changeable, is as the unessential. The two are,
for it, essences that are alien to one another; and because it is itself the consciousness
of this contradiction, it ranges itself on the side of the changeable consciousness,
and is to itself the unessential; but as consciousness of unchangeableness, or of the
simple essence, it must at the same time set about freeing itself from the unessential,
i.e. freeing itself from itself. For though it is for itself              only the changeable, and the
unchangeable is, for it, something alien, yet it is itself simple, and hence unchange-
able, consciousness, a consciousness of which it is thus conscious as its essence, but
in such a way that for itself again it itself is not this essence. The position it assigns to
the two cannot therefore be an indifference of them towards each other, i.e. not an

indifference of itself towards the unchangeable; rather, it is itself immediately
both of them, and the relation of the two is for it as a relation of the essence to the
non-essence, so that this latter is to be sublated; but since for it both are equally
essential and contradictory, it is merely the contradictory movement in which the
contrary does not come to rest in its contrary, but within it only generates itself
anew as a contrary.1
    ¶209. Here, then, we have a struggle against an enemy, victory over whom is rather a
defeat, where attainment of the one is rather the loss of it in its contrary. Consciousness
of life, of its Being-there and activity, is only grief over this Being-there and activity, for
it has in this only the consciousness of its contrary as the essence and of its own
nothingness. It passes over out of this into an ascent to the unchangeable. But this
ascent is itself this consciousness; so the ascent is the consciousness of the contrary,
namely of itself as singularity. The unchangeable that enters into consciousness is
by this very fact at the same time affected by singularity, and is only present with the
latter; far from having destroyed singularity in the consciousness of the unchangeable,
singularity only emerges constantly in it.1
    ¶210. But in this movement consciousness experiences just this                             emergence of
singularity in the unchangeable, and of the unchangeable in singularity. There comes
to be for consciousness singularity in general in the unchangeable essence, and at the
same time its own singularity in it. For the truth of this movement is just the oneness
of this double consciousness. This unity becomes for it, but is initially a unity in which
the diversity of the two is         still the dominant feature. Thus there is present for con-
sciousness the threefold way in which singularity is linked with the unchangeable:
first, consciousness again emerges for itself as opposed to the unchangeable; and it
is thrown back to the beginning of the struggle which remains the element of the
whole relationship. But           secondly, the     unchangeable        itself has   singularity in it      for
consciousness, so that singularity is the shape of the unchangeable and with this
the entire mode of existence passes over into the unchangeable. Thirdly, conscious-
ness finds its own self as this singular in the unchangeable. The first                       unchangeable
is to consciousness only the alien essence condemning singularity; since the second
unchangeable is a shape of singularity as consciousness itself is, consciousness, thirdly,
comes to be spirit, it has the joy of finding itself in it, and becomes conscious that its
singularity is reconciled with the universal.1
    ¶211. What presents itself here as mode and relationship of the unchangeable
arose as the experience which the divided self-consciousness undergoes in its unhap-
piness. Now this experience is, of course, not its own one-sided movement, for this
self-consciousness is itself unchangeable consciousness, accordingly the latter is at
the same time singular consciousness too, and the movement is just as much a
movement of the unchangeable consciousness, which takes part in the movement
as much as the other; for the movement runs through these moments:                                  first, the
unchangeable is opposed to the singular in general; then, itself singular, it is opposed
to the other singular; and finally, it is one with this singular. But this consideration,
insofar as it belongs to us, is here untimely, for what has arisen for us up to now is
only unchangeableness as unchangeableness of consciousness, which is therefore not
true unchangeableness, but still burdened with an opposition, not the unchangeable
in and for itself; we do not know, therefore, how the latter will behave. What has
---
    . -

emerged here is only this: that to consciousness, which is our object here, the
determinations indicated appear in the unchangeable.1
   ¶212. For this reason therefore the unchangeable consciousness also retains in its
very shaping the character and foundation of dividedness and Being-for-itself with
regard to the singular consciousness. Consequently, for the latter, the unchange-
able’s acquisition of the shape of singularity is altogether a happening; just as it also
merely     finds  itself opposed to it and thus has this relationship                    by nature; that,
finally, it does     find itself  in the unchangeable, appears to it to be brought about
partly, no doubt, by itself, or to take place because it is itself singular; but a part of
this unity, both as regards its origin and insofar as it is, appears as belonging to the
unchangeable; and the opposition persists within this unity itself. In fact, through
the shaping of the unchangeable, the moment of the beyond has not only remained,
but is rather still established; for if the beyond seems, on the one hand, to have been
brought closer to consciousness through the shape of singular actuality, on the
other hand from now on it confronts it as an opaque sensory                             one, with all the
rigidity of something actual; the hope of becoming one with it must remain a hope,
i.e. without fulfilment and presence, for between the hope and the fulfilment stands
precisely the absolute contingency or immobile indifference which lies in the
shaping itself, the shaping that grounds the hope. Through the nature of this one
that simply is, through the actuality that it has assumed, it necessarily happens that
it has vanished in time, and that it has been in space and far away, and remains
utterly far away.1
   ¶213. If at first the mere concept of the divided consciousness determined itself to
set about sublating itself as singular and becoming the unchangeable consciousness,
from now on its endeavour has this determination: rather to sublate its relationship
to the pure unshaped unchangeable, and to acquire a relation only with the shaped
unchangeable. For the oneness of the singular with the unchangeable is henceforth
essence   and    object   for consciousness, just as in the concept the shapeless abstract
unchangeable was the essential object; and the relationship of this absolute divided-
ness of the concept is now what it has to turn away from. But as for the initially
external relation to the shaped unchangeable as an alien actuality, it has to elevate this
to absolute unification. 1
   ¶214. The movement in which the unessential consciousness strives to attain this
oneness is itself the threefold movement corresponding to the threefold relationship
that this consciousness will have with its shaped Beyond: first, as pure consciousness;
secondly, as singular essence that comports itself towards actuality as desire and work;
and thirdly, as
three modes of its Being are present and determined in that universal relationship.1consciousness of its Being-for-itself.—We now have to see how these
   ¶215. First, then, when consciousness is considered as                       pure consciousness, the
shaped unchangeable, when he is for the pure consciousness, seems to be posited
as he is in and for himself. But how he is in and for himself, this, as we have already
mentioned, has not yet arisen. For him to be in consciousness as he is in and for
himself, this would certainly have to proceed from him rather than from the con-
sciousness; but his presence here is thus at               first only one-sidedly at hand through
consciousness, and for that very reason not perfect and genuine, but remains burdened
with imperfection or an opposition.1

   ¶216. But although the unhappy consciousness therefore does not possess this
presence, it is at the same time beyond pure thinking insofar as this is the abstract
thinking of Stoicism which averts its eyes from singularity altogether, and the merely
agitated thinking of Scepticism,—which is in fact only singularity as unconscious
contradiction and restless movement; it is beyond both of these, it brings and keeps
together pure thinking and singularity, but has not yet risen to that thinking                               for
which    the singularity of consciousness is reconciled with pure thinking itself. It
stands rather in the middle, where abstract thinking comes into contact with the
singularity of consciousness as singularity. Consciousness itself is this contact; it is
the unity of pure thinking and singularity; this is also for consciousness, this thinking
singularity or pure thinking, and the unchangeable itself essentially as singularity. But
what is not for it is that this, its object, the unchangeable, which essentially presents
itself to it in the shape of singularity, is consciousness itself, itself, which is singularity
of consciousness.1
   ¶217. In this first mode therefore, where we consider it as pure consciousness, it
does not comport itself to its object thinkingly, but, since it is indeed                       in itself  pure
thinking singularity, and its object is just this pure thinking, though the relation of
one to the other is not itself pure thinking, it only goes, so to speak, towards thinking,
and is devotion. As such, its thinking remains the amorphous peal of bell-ringing, or a
warm cloud of mist, a musical thinking that does not get as far as the concept, which
would be the only immanent objective mode. This infinite pure inner feeling will
indeed find its object, but the object will make its entrance not as a conceptualized
object, and will therefore enter as something alien. What we have here therefore is the
inward movement of the              pure   heart which       feels  itself, but feels itself painfully as
division; the movement of an infinite yearning that has the certainty that its essence
is such a pure heart, pure thinking that thinks itself as singularity; certainty that it is
known and recognized by this object, precisely because the object thinks itself as
singularity. At the same time, however, this essence is the unattainable Beyond which
flees as we grasp at it, or rather has already fled. It has already flown; for it is on the
one hand the unchangeable that thinks itself as singularity, and consciousness
therefore immediately attains its own self in it, its own self, but as the consciousness
opposed to the unchangeable; instead of grasping the essence, it only feels it and has
fallen back into itself; since in the attainment it cannot keep itself as this opposed
consciousness at bay, it has, instead of grasping the essence, only grasped the
inessentiality. Just as on one side, in striving to attain itself in the essence, it grasps
only its own separated actuality, so on the other side it cannot grasp the other as a
singular, or as actual. Where the other is sought, it cannot be found, for it is supposed
to be precisely a Beyond, the sort of thing that cannot be found. When sought as a
singular, it is not a universal singularity in thought, not a concept, but a singular as
object, or something actual; an object of immediate sensory certainty, and for that
very reason only the sort of thing that has vanished. For consciousness therefore only
the grave of its life can come to presence. But because this grave is itself an actuality
and it goes against the nature of actuality to grant a lasting possession, this presence
of the grave, too, is merely the struggle of an endeavour that is bound to be lost. But
having learned from experience that the grave of its actual unchangeable essence has
no actuality, that the vanished singularity, as vanished, is not the true singularity,
---
    . -

consciousness will give up looking for the unchangeable singularity as                               actual, or
holding on to it as vanished, and only in this way is it able to find singularity as
genuine or as universal.1
   ¶218. But initially the return of the heart into its own self is to be taken to signify
that it has its actuality as a singular. It is the pure heart which for us or in itself has
found itself and is satiated within itself, for although for it in its feeling the essence
separates itself from it, yet in itself this feeling is self-feeling, it has felt the object of its
pure feeling, and this object is itself; from this it thus emerges as self-feeling, or as
something that is actual for itself. In this return into itself its second relationship has
emerged for us, the relationship of desire and work, which confirm for consciousness
the inner certainty of itself (which it has attained for us), by sublation and enjoyment
of the alien essence, namely the essence in the form of independent things. But the
unhappy consciousness finds itself only as desiring and working; it is not on hand for
consciousness that the inner certainty of itself lies at the basis of its finding itself thus,
and that its feeling of the essence is this self-feeling. Since it does not have this
certainty for its own self, its interior rather still remains the broken certainty of itself;
the confirmation that it would obtain through work and enjoyment is therefore just
such a broken confirmation; or rather it must for itself nullify this confirmation so
that it does
namely confirmation of its dividedness. 1find confirmation in it, but only confirmation of what it is for itself,
   ¶219. The actuality against which desire and work are directed is no longer for
this consciousness a nullity in itself, something merely to be sublated and consumed
by it, but something like that consciousness itself, an actuality broken in two, which
is only on one side null in itself, but on the other side is also a sanctified world; it is
a shape of the unchangeable, for this has received in itself singularity, and because,
as the unchangeable, it is a universal, its singularity has in general the significance of
all actuality.1
   ¶220. If consciousness were for itself independent consciousness, and actuality
were to it null in and for itself, then in the labour and in the enjoyment it would
attain to the feeling of its independence, in virtue of the fact that it would be
consciousness itself that sublated actuality. But since this actuality is to conscious-
ness a shape of the unchangeable, it is unable of itself to sublate it. But when it does
succeed in nullifying actuality and enjoying it, this essentially happens for con-
sciousness in virtue of the fact that the unchangeable itself surrenders its shape, and
hands it over to consciousness for enjoyment.—Consciousness, for its part, likewise
emerges here as something actual, but equally as internally broken, and in its labour
and enjoyment this dividedness displays itself as breaking up into a relationship to
actuality or     Being-for-itself, and a         Being-in-itself. This relationship to actuality is
altering or activity, the Being-for-itself that belongs to the singular consciousness as
such. But in this, consciousness is also in itself: this side belongs to the unchange-
able Beyond; it is the faculties and forces, an alien gift, which the unchangeable also
hands over to consciousness for it to use.1
   ¶221. Accordingly, in its activity, consciousness is initially in the relationship of
two extremes; on one side it stands as active worldliness, and confronting it is passive
actuality: the two sides are in relation with one another, but both have also with-
drawn into the unchangeable and keep to themselves. From each side therefore only a
---

surface detaches itself in response to the other, and this enters the play of movement
with regard to the other.—The extreme of actuality is sublated by the active extreme;
but actuality, on its side, can be sublated only for the reason that its unchangeable
essence sublates it itself, repels itself from itself, and hands over what is repelled to the
activity. The active force appears as             the power      in which actuality is dissolved; but
because of this, for this consciousness, to which the in-itself or the essence is something
other than itself, this power, in the form of which it enters the lists in its activity, is
the beyond of consciousness itself. So instead of returning from its activity back into
itself and having proved itself for its own self, consciousness rather reflects this
movement of activity back into the other extreme, which is thereby displayed as a
pure universal, as the absolute power from which the movement proceeded in all
directions, and which is the essence both of the self-disintegrating extremes as they at
first emerged, and of the exchange itself.1
   ¶222. By the fact that the unchangeable consciousness renounces its shape and
surrenders     it, by the fact that by contrast the singular consciousness                      gives thanks,
i.e. denies itself the satisfaction of the consciousness of its independence, and assigns
the essence of the activity not to itself but to the beyond, by these two moments of
reciprocal    self-renunciation       of both parties there certainly arises for consciousness
its unity   with the unchangeable. But this unity is at the same time affected with
separation, is again broken within itself, and from it the opposition of the universal
and singular emerges again. For consciousness does make a show of renouncing the
satisfaction of its self-feeling, but it obtains the actual satisfaction of it; for it has been
desire, work, and enjoyment; as consciousness                      it has   willed,   acted, and      enjoyed.
Likewise its thanks-giving, in which it recognizes the other extreme as the essence
and sublates itself, is itself its own activity which counterbalances the activity of the
other extreme, and opposes an equal activity to the self-sacrificing benefaction; if the
other extreme delivers over to consciousness its surface, consciousness gives thanks
all the same, and in surrendering its activity, i.e. its essence, it really does more than the
other which only discards a surface from itself. Thus not only in the actual desiring,
working, and enjoying, but even in the thanks-giving itself where the contrary seems
to happen, the entire movement is reflected into the                       extreme of singularity. Con-
sciousness feels itself therein as this singular consciousness, and does not let itself be
deceived by the semblance of its renunciation, for the truth of this consciousness is
that it has not surrendered itself; what has come about is only the double reflection
into the two extremes; and the result is the renewed splitting into the opposed
consciousness of the unchangeable, and the consciousness of the willing, accomplish-
ing, and enjoying confronting it, and of the self-renunciation itself, or in general of the
singularity that is for itself. 1
   ¶223. This has introduced the              third relationship       of the movement of this con-
sciousness, a relationship which proceeds from the second as a consciousness that
has in truth proved itself as independent by its willing and accomplishing. In the first
relationship it was only concept of actual consciousness, or the inner heart that is not
yet actual in its doing and enjoyment; the                  second    is this actualization as external
doing and enjoying; but on its return from this, it is the sort of consciousness that has
experienced itself as actual and activating consciousness, or for which it is true to be in
and for itself. But in this the enemy is now discovered in his ownmost shape. In the
---
     . -

struggle of the heart the singular consciousness is only as musical, abstract moment;
in work and enjoyment, as the realization of this essence-bereft Being, consciousness
can immediately forget itself, and the conscious stake in this actuality is cancelled out
by the thankful recognition. But this cancellation is in truth a return of consciousness
into itself, and into itself as the actuality that is genuine for it.1
    ¶224. This third relationship, in which this genuine actuality is one of the
extremes, is the relation of that actuality, as nullity, to the universal essence; and the
movement of this relation is still to be considered.
    ¶225. Concerning first the opposed relation of consciousness where its reality is
to it immediately the null, its actual doing thus becomes a doing of nothing, its
enjoyment a feeling of its unhappiness. Activity and enjoyment thereby lose all
universal content and significance, for this would give them a Being-in-itself and
Being-for-itself, and both withdraw into singularity, on which consciousness is
directed in order to sublate it. Consciousness is conscious of itself as                          this actual
singleton in the animal functions. These functions are no longer performed ingenu-
ously, as something that is null in and for itself and which cannot acquire any
importance or essentiality for the spirit; instead, since it is in them that the enemy
reveals himself in his characteristic shape, they are rather the object of serious
endeavour, and come precisely to be of supreme importance. This enemy, however,
generates himself in his defeat, and consciousness, in                     fixing its attention on him,
far from freeing itself from him, rather always dwells on him, and always sees itself
as defiled; and since at the same time this content of its efforts, instead of being
something essential, is the most base, instead of being a universal, is the most
singular, we see only a personality confined to its own self and its petty doings, a
personality afflicting itself, as unhappy as it is impoverished. 1
    ¶226. But to these two, the feeling of its unhappiness and the poverty of its activity,
is linked also the consciousness of its unity with the unchangeable. For the attempted
immediate annihilation of its actual Being is mediated by the thought of the unchange-
able, and happens in this           relation. The mediate         relation constitutes the essence of
the negative movement in which consciousness is directed against its singularity,
but which, as a relation, is in itself positive as well and will produce this its unity for
consciousness itself.1
    ¶227. This mediate relation is thus a syllogism in which singularity, initially fixing
itself in opposition to the          in-itself, is joined together with this other extreme only
through a third term. Through this middle term the extreme of the unchangeable
is for the unessential consciousness, which at the same time also involves this: it is
likewise for the unchangeable consciousness only through this middle term, and thus
this middle term is one which represents the two extremes to one another, and is the
reciprocal minister of each one with the other. This middle term is itself a conscious
essence, for it is an activity mediating consciousness as such; the content of this
activity is the extinction that consciousness undertakes with its singularity.1
    ¶228. In the middle term then, consciousness frees itself from activity and enjoy-
ment as its own; it throws off the essence of its will from itself as an extreme that is for
itself, and casts upon the middle term or minister the ownership and freedom of the
decision, and herewith the            guilt  of its activity. This mediator, being in immediate
relation with the unchangeable essence, ministers with its advice on what is right. The

action, since it is compliance with an alien resolution, ceases, as regards the doing or
the  willing, to be its own. But there is still left to the unessential consciousness the
objective aspect, viz. the fruit         of its labour, and the enjoyment. This too it likewise
casts off from itself, and just as it renounces its will, so it renounces the actuality it
received in work and in enjoyment; it renounces them partly as the attained truth of
its self-conscious independence—when it sets about representing and speaking some-
thing entirely alien, something that makes no sense to it;—it renounces them partly
as external property,—when it forgoes part of the possession it has acquired through
work; partly it renounces the enjoyment it has had—when, in fasting and mortifica-
tions, it once more completely denies itself enjoyment as well.1
   ¶229. Through these moments of relinquishment, of its own decision, then of
property and enjoyment, and finally through the positive moment of engaging in an
enterprise it does not understand, it deprives itself in truth and completely of the
consciousness of inner and outer freedom, of actuality as its Being-for-itself; it has the
certainty of having in truth estranged its I, and of having made its immediate self-
consciousness into a          thing, into an objective Being.—Only through this                          actual
sacrifice could it confirm the self-renunciation; for only in the sacrifice does the
deception vanish which lies in the inner recognition by giving thanks through heart,
sentiment, and tongue, a recognition which indeed discards from itself all power of
Being-for-itself and ascribes it to a gift from above, but which in this very discarding
retains its outer stake in the possession it does not give up, and its inner stake in the
consciousness of the decision it has itself made, and in the consciousness of its
content determined by itself, which it has not exchanged for an alien content, filling
it up senselessly.1
   ¶230. But in the sacrifice actually carried out, just as consciousness has sublated
the  activity as its own, so in itself its unhappiness has also withdrawn from it. That
this withdrawal has happened in itself is however the doing of the other extreme of
the syllogism, of the essence             being-in-itself. But the sacrifice of the unessential
extreme was at the same time not a one-sided doing, but contained within itself
the doing of the other. For the surrender of its own will is negative only on one side,
by its concept or in itself, but it is at the same time positive, viz. the positing of will as
the will of an other, and specifically of the will, not as a singular will, but as universal
will. For this consciousness this positive significance of the negatively posited singu-
lar will is the will of the other extreme, a will which, just because it is an other for
consciousness, comes about for it not through itself, but through the third party, the
mediator as counsellor. Hence, for consciousness, its will does indeed become uni-
versal will that is      in itself, but to itself consciousness          is not this in-itself; for it, the
surrender of its own will, as            singular, is not in its concept the positive aspect of
universal will. Similarly, its surrender of possession and enjoyment has only the same
negative significance, and the universal that thereby comes about for it, is not for it its
own doing. This unity of the objective and Being-for-itself, which is in the concept of
activity, and which therefore becomes the essence and object for consciousness—just
as this unity is not the concept of its activity, so too it is not given to consciousness
that the unity comes about for it as an object, immediately and through itself; instead,
it lets the mediating minister express this certainty, itself still broken, the certainty
that only in itself is its unhappiness the reverse, viz. an activity that satisfies itself in

the activity or blissful enjoyment, that its impoverished activity likewise is in itself the
reverse, viz. an absolute activity; that by the concept activity is only activity at all as
activity of the singular. But            for consciousness        itself activity and its actual activity
remain an impoverished activity, and its enjoyment remains pain, and the sublation
of them in its positive significance remains a beyond. But in this object, in which its
doing and Being, as the doing and Being of this singular consciousness, are to it Being
and doing in themselves, there has come about for consciousness the representation
of reason, of the certainty of consciousness that, in its singularity, it is absolutely in
itself, or all reality. 1

         C. (AA.) Reason

         V. Certainty and Truth of Reason
¶231. In the thought it has grasped, that the                     singular     consciousness is  in itself
absolute essence, consciousness returns into itself. For the unhappy consciousness
the Being-in-itself is the beyond of itself. But its movement has accomplished this in it:
it has posited singularity in its complete development, or it has posited the singularity
that is actual consciousness, as the negative of itself, namely, as the objective extreme,
or it has wrested its Being-for-itself away from itself and has turned it into Being;
in this movement its unity with this universal has also come to be for consciousness,
a unity which, for us, no longer falls outside it, since the sublated singular is the
universal; and which, since consciousness maintains itself in this its negativity, is, in
consciousness as such, its essence. Its truth is that which appears in the syllogism,
whose extremes were held absolutely asunder when they entered the scene, as the
middle term which proclaims to the unchangeable consciousness that the singular
has renounced itself, and, to the singular, that the unchangeable is for it no longer an
extreme, but is reconciled with it. This middle term is the unity immediately aware of,
and relating, both, and is the consciousness of their unity, which it proclaims to
consciousness and thereby to itself; it is the certainty of being all truth. 1
    ¶232. Now that self-consciousness is reason, its hitherto negative relationship to
otherness turns round into a positive relationship. So far it has been concerned only
with its independence and freedom, with a view to saving and maintaining itself
for itself at the expense of the world or of its own actuality, both of which appeared to
it as the negative of its essence. But as reason, assured of itself, it has made its peace
with them, and can endure them; for it is certain of itself as actuality, or certain that
actuality is none other than itself; its thinking is itself immediately actuality; and thus
it adopts towards actuality the attitude of idealism. Conceiving itself in this way, it is
for it as if the world had now arisen for it for the first time; previously it does not
understand the world; it desires it and works on it, withdraws from it into itself and
demolishes it for itself, and demolishes its own self as consciousness—both as
consciousness of the world as the essence and as consciousness of the nullity of the
world. It is only after the grave of its truth has been lost, after the demolition of its
actuality has itself been demolished, and after the singularity of consciousness is in
itself absolute essence for it, it is then that it discovers the world as its new actual
world, which in its permanence holds an interest for it which previously lay only in
its disappearance; for the subsistence of the world becomes for consciousness its own
truth and presence; it is certain of experiencing only itself therein. 1
    ¶233. Reason is the certainty of consciousness that it is all reality; this is how
idealism expresses its        concept. Just as the consciousness, that comes on the scene                as
---
    . (.) 

reason, immediately has that certainty in itself, so too idealism expresses that certainty
immediately: I am I, in the sense that I, which is an object for me, is not merely an
empty object in general, as in self-consciousness in general, nor is it merely an object
that withdraws from the others, leaving them in force alongside it, as in the case of free
self-consciousness; instead, it is an object with the consciousness of the non-Being of
any other object, it is the sole object, all reality and all presence. But self-consciousness
is all reality not merely for itself but also in itself, only through becoming this reality, or
rather through demonstrating itself to be such. It demonstrates itself thus on the path
on which first, in the dialectical movement of meaning, perceiving and the under-
standing, otherness vanishes as             in itself, and then, in the movement through the
independence of consciousness in lordship and bondage, through the thought of
freedom, the sceptical liberation and the combat of absolute liberation of the con-
sciousness divided within itself, otherness, insofar as it is only                       for consciousness,
vanishes    for consciousness itself. Two sides entered the scene, one after the other:
one in which the essence or the true had for consciousness the determinacy of Being,
the other in which it had the determinacy of being only for consciousness. But the two
reduced themselves to one truth, that what is, or the in-itself, only is insofar as it is for
consciousness, and what is for consciousness is also in itself. The consciousness which
is this truth has this path behind it and has forgotten it, when it comes on the scene
immediately as reason, or this reason which comes immediately on the scene enters
the scene only as the certainty of that truth. Thus reason merely affirms that it is all
reality, but does not itself comprehend this; for that forgotten path is the comprehen-
sion of this immediately expressed assertion. And equally, to anyone who has not
traversed that path this assertion is incomprehensible when he hears it in this pure
form,—for in a concrete shape he does indeed make the assertion himself.1
   ¶234. Idealism, which does not present that path but begins with this assertion,
is therefore also pure affirmation, which does not comprehend its own self, nor can
it make itself comprehensible to others. It expresses an immediate certainty which
is confronted by other immediate certainties, which have, however, got lost on that
path. With equal right, therefore, the affirmations of these other certainties, too, take
their place    alongside     the  affirmation      of that certainty. Reason appeals to the                self-
consciousness of each and every consciousness: I am I, my object and essence is I; and
no consciousness will deny reason this truth. But in basing the truth on this appeal,
reason sanctions the truth of the other certainty, namely: there is for me an other; an
other than I is object and essence for me, or, in that I am object and essence to myself,
I am so only by drawing back from the other in general, and taking my place as
an actuality alongside it.—Only when reason comes on the scene as a reflection from
this opposite certainty does its assertion about itself enter the scene not merely as
certainty and affirmation, but as truth; and not alongside other truths but as the sole
truth. Its immediate entry on the scene is the abstraction of its sheer presence, whose
essence and Being-in-itself is absolute concept, i.e. the movement of its having-come-
about.—Consciousness will determine its relationship to otherness or its object in
diverse ways, according to the precise stage it occupies of the world-spirit becoming
conscious of itself. How it immediately finds and determines itself and its object at
any time, or how it is         for itself, depends on what it has already              become, or what it
already is in itself. 1

   ¶235. Reason is the certainty of being all                 reality. This in-itself or this        reality is,
however, still a universal pure and simple, the pure abstraction of reality. It is the first
positivity, which self-consciousness is, in its own self, for itself, and I is therefore only
the pure essentiality of beings or is the simple category. The category, which formerly
had the significance of being the essentiality of beings, indeterminately of beings in
general or of beings facing consciousness, is now essentiality or simple unity of beings
only as actuality that thinks; or the category is this, that self-consciousness and Being
are the same essence;         the same, not in comparison, but in and for themselves. It is
only the one-sided, bad idealism that lets this unity again plant itself on one side as
consciousness, and confronting it an in-itself.—But now this category or simple unity
of self-consciousness and Being has difference in itself; for its essence is just this: in
otherness, or in absolute difference, to be immediately equal to itself. The difference
therefore    is, but is perfectly transparent, and as a difference that is at the same
time no difference. It appears as a plurality of categories. Since idealism proclaims
the simple unity of self-consciousness to be all reality, and immediately makes it the
essence without having comprehended it as absolutely negative essence—only this
has negation, determinacy, or difference within itself—this second point, that in the
category there are differences or species, is even more incomprehensible than the first.
This affirmation in general, as well as the affirmation of a                      determinate number           of
species of categories, is a new affirmation, which, however, itself implies that we no
longer have to accept it as affirmation. For since the difference originates in the pure I,
in the pure understanding itself, it is thereby posited that the                            immediacy, the
affirming    and    finding, are here abandoned and               comprehension        begins. But to take
the plurality of categories again in some way or other as a find, e.g., from judgements,
and accepting them like that, should in fact be regarded as an outrage on science;
where else should the understanding be able to show a necessity, if it is unable to do
so in its own self, which is pure necessity?1
   ¶236. Now because the pure essentiality of things, like their difference, belongs
thus to reason, we can, strictly speaking, no longer talk of things at all, i.e. of something
which would be for consciousness merely the negative of itself. For to say that the
many categories are species of the pure category means that this latter                           is still their
genus or essence, not opposed to them. But they are already something ambiguous,
which at the same time has in itself otherness in its plurality in contrast to the pure
category. In fact, they contradict the pure category by this plurality, and the pure
unity must sublate them in itself, thereby constituting itself as negative unity of the
differences. But, as negative          unity, it excludes from itself the differences              as such, as
well as that     first immediate       pure unity as such, and is            singularity; a new category
which is consciousness as excluding, i.e. consciousness for which there is                           an other.
Singularity is the transition of the category from its concept to an external reality, the
pure   schema     which is both consciousness and, since it is singularity and exclusive
unit, the pointing to an other. But this other of this category is merely the other first
categories, viz. pure essentiality and pure difference; and in this category, i.e. just in the
positedness of the other, or in this other itself, consciousness is equally itself. Each of
these diverse moments refers to another moment; but at the same time in them we do
not get to any otherness. The pure category refers to the species, which pass over into
the negative category or singularity; this latter, however, refers back to them; it is
---
     . (.) 

itself pure consciousness which in each species remains to itself this clear unity with
itself, but a unity which equally is referred to an other, which, when it is, has
vanished, and when it has vanished, also regenerates itself.1
    ¶237. Here we see pure consciousness posited in a twofold manner: once as the
restless   movement to and fro            that runs through all its moments, having in them
before its eyes an otherness that sublates itself in the act of grasping it; and again,
rather as the tranquil unity certain of its own truth. For this unity that movement is
the other, while for this movement that tranquil unity is the other; and consciousness
and object alternate in these reciprocal determinations. Thus at one time conscious-
ness is to itself a search moving hither and thither, and its object is the pure in-itself
and essence; at another time, it is to itself the simple category, and the object is the
movement of the differences. But consciousness as essence is this whole course itself,
of passing out of itself as simple category into singularity and the object, and of
intuiting this course in the object, sublating it as a distinct object,                    appropriating it,
and proclaiming itself as this certainty of being all reality, of being both itself and
its object.1
    ¶238. Its first proclamation is only this abstract empty word that everything is its
own. For the certainty of being all reality is at first only the pure category. This reason
which first recognizes itself in the object finds expression in the empty idealism which
grasps reason only as it is initially, and fancies that by indicating this pure Mine of
consciousness in all Being,1 and by declaring things to be sensations or representa-
tions, it has indicated this pure Mine as completed reality. It therefore must at the
same time be absolute empiricism, since for the filling of the empty Mine, i.e. for the
difference and all development and shaping of the difference, its reason requires an
alien impulse, in which the variety of sensation or representation is first to be found.
This idealism therefore becomes the same kind of self-contradictory equivocation as
scepticism, except that, while scepticism expresses itself negatively, this idealism
expresses itself positively; but it fails as much as scepticism to bring together its
contradictory thoughts, the thought of pure consciousness as all reality, and likewise
the thought of the alien impulse or of sensation and representation as an equal
reality; instead it rushes to and fro from one to the other, and has ended up by falling
into bad infinity, namely sensory infinity. Since reason is all reality in the sense of the
abstract    Mine, and the        other    is to it an    indifferent alien, what is here posited is
precisely the same knowing of an other by reason, which we met with as meaning,
perceiving, and as the          understanding       that apprehends what is meant and what is
perceived. Such a knowing is at the same time asserted by the concept of this idealism
itself not to be a true knowing, for only the unity of apperception is the truth of
knowing. The pure reason of this idealism, in order to reach this                            other   which is
essential to it, i.e. which is thus the in-itself, but which it does not have within it, is
therefore thrown back by its own self onto that knowing which is not a knowing of
the true; in this way, it condemns itself of its own knowledge and volition to an
untrue knowing, and cannot get away from meaning and perceiving, which for it
have no truth. It is involved in immediate contradiction, affirming as the essence a
duet of utter opposites, the             unity of apperception          and equally the        thing, which,
whether it is called alien impulse, or empirical essence, or sensibility, or the thing in
itself, remains in its concept the same alien adjunct to that unity. 2

   ¶239. This idealism is involved in this contradiction because it affirms the abstract
concept of reason as the true; consequently, reality immediately arises for it equally as
the sort of reality that is not the reality of reason, while at the same time reason is
supposed to be all reality; reason remains a restless searching, which in its very
searching declares the satisfaction of finding to be utterly impossible.—Actual reason,
however, is not so inconsistent; on the contrary, at                        first only the       certainty     of
being all reality, it is conscious in this concept, as certainty, as I, of not yet being
reality in truth, and is impelled to raise its certainty to truth and to
empty Mine. 1                                                                                      fill up the
A. Observing reason
¶240. In fact, we now see this consciousness, for which Being has the significance of
its own, 1 revert to meaning and perceiving, though not to certainty of a mere other,
but with the certainty of being this other itself. Previously, its perception and
experience of various sides of the thing just happened to consciousness, while here
consciousness arranges the observations and the experience itself. Meaning and
perceiving, which previously were sublated for us, are now sublated by and for
consciousness itself. Reason sets out to                 know    the truth; to      find as concept that
which, for meaning and perceiving, is a thing, i.e. to have in thinghood the conscious-
ness only of itself. Reason now has, therefore, a universal interest in the world, because
it is the certainty of having presence in the world, or that the presence is rational. It
seeks its other, knowing that therein it possesses nothing other than itself: it seeks only
its own infinitude. 2
   ¶241. At first only glimpsing itself in actuality, or knowing actuality only as its own
in general, with a sense of this it advances to take universal possession of its assured
property, and plants the sign of its sovereignty on every height and in every depth.
But this superficial Mine is not its ultimate interest; the joy of this universal seizure of
possession still     finds in its property the alien other which abstract reason does not
have within itself. Reason glimpses itself as a deeper essence than the pure I is, and
must demand that difference,              manifold Being, become the I’s very own, that the
I intuit itself as actuality and         find itself present as shape and thing. But if reason
excavates all the entrails of things and opens every vein in them so that it may gush
forth to meet itself, it will not attain this joy; it must have completed itself within itself
before it can experience the completion of itself.1
   ¶242. Consciousness observes; i.e. reason wants to                     find and to have itself as an
object that is, as an actual, sensorily-present mode. The consciousness of this observ-
ing indeed opines and says that it wants to undergo experience, not of itself but, on
the contrary, of the essence of things as things. That this consciousness opines and says
this, is implied in the fact that it is reason; but reason as such is not as yet object for
this consciousness. If it knew that              reason    is equally the essence of things and of
consciousness itself, and that only in consciousness can reason be present in its own
proper shape, it would descend into its own depths, and seek reason there rather than
in things. If it had found it within, reason would be directed from there outside to
actuality again, in order to intuit therein its sensory expression, but at once to take it
essentially as concept. Reason, as it immediately arises as consciousness’s certainty of
being all reality, takes its reality in the sense of the immediacy of Being, and similarly
---
     . (.) 

it takes the unity of the I with this objective essence in the sense of an                         immediate
unity, a unity in which reason has not yet separated and reunited again the moments
of Being and the I, or a unity which reason has not yet cognized. Reason, therefore, as
observing consciousness, approaches things in the opinion that it takes them in truth
as sensory things opposed to the I; but its actual doing contradicts this opinion, for it
cognizes things, it transforms their sensuality into concepts, i.e. into just a Being which
is at the same time I, consequently transforms thinking into a thinking that is, or
Being into a thought Being, and it asserts, in fact, that it is only as concepts that things
have truth. For observing consciousness, all that emerges from this is what the things
are, but for us, what consciousness itself is; but the result of its movement will be that
consciousness will become for itself what it is in itself.1
   ¶243. We have to consider             the doing of observing reason in the moments of its
movement, how it apprehends nature and spirit, and, finally, the relation of both, as
sensory Being, and how it seeks itself as actuality that is.1
.    
¶244. When thoughtless consciousness affirms observation and experience as the
source of truth, its words may well sound as if only tasting, smelling, feeling, hearing,
and seeing were involved; in the zeal with which it recommends tasting, smelling,
etc., it forgets to say that in fact it has also just as essentially already determined the
object of its sensation, and this determination is worth at least as much to conscious-
ness as that sensation. It will also readily admit that in general its concern here is not
solely with perceiving, and will not let, e.g., the perception that this penknife lies
alongside this snuff-box, pass for an observation. What is perceived should at least
have the significance of a universal, not of a sensory This. 1
   ¶245. This universal is thus at first only what remains-equal-to-itself; its movement
is only the uniform recurrence of the same doing. Consciousness, which to that
extent finds in the object only universality or the abstract Mine, must take upon itself
the movement proper to the object and, since it is not yet the understanding of the
object, must at least be the remembrance of it, which expresses in a universal way
what in actuality is present only in a singular way. This superficial elevation out of
singularity, and the equally superficial form of universality into which the sensory is
merely taken up, without having become in its own self a universal, the describing of
things, does not yet have the movement in the object itself; the movement is really
only in the describing. The object, as soon as it is described, has therefore lost its
interest; if the one has been described, then another must be dealt with, and
continually sought, in order that the describing does not give out. If it is no longer
so easy to find new whole things, then we must go back to those already found, divide
them further, analyse them, and bring to light fresh sides of thinghood in them. This
restless, insatiable instinct can never run out of material; to discover a distinctive new
genus, or even a new planet which, although it is an individual, possesses the nature
of a universal, can be the lot of only a lucky few. But the limit of what, like the
elephant, the oak, gold, is         distinctive, of what is        genus and      species, passes through
many stages into the infinite particularization of the chaos of animals and plants, of
mountain-types, or the metals, earths, etc., that only force and skill can bring to
view. In this realm of the indeterminacy of the universal, where particularization
---
                                                 .                           

approximates again to            singularization, and again, here and there, descends to it
entirely, an inexhaustible fund is opened up for observation and description. But
here, where an immense field opens up for that instinct, at the limit of the universal, it
can have found not an immeasurable wealth, but instead merely the boundary of
nature and of its own doing: it can no longer know whether what seems to be in itself
is not a contingency; what bears in itself the stamp of a confused or immature
structure, feeble and barely developing out of rudimentary indeterminacy, can lay
no claim even to be only described.1
    ¶246. If this searching and describing seems to be concerned only with things, we
see that in fact it does not continue indefinitely in sensory perceiving; on the contrary,
that by which things are cognized is more important to it than the remaining complex
of sensory properties which, of course, the thing itself cannot dispense with, but
which consciousness does without. Through this distinction between the                           essential
and the     unessential, the concept rises up out of sensory dispersion, and cognition
thereby declares that it is just as essentially concerned with its own self as with things.
With this double essentiality cognition lapses into vacillation as to whether what is
essential and necessary for cognition is so also in respect of things. On the one hand,
the differentiae are supposed to serve only cognition, enabling it to distinguish things
from one another; but, on the other hand, it is not the unessential side of things that
is supposed to be cognized, but that side whereby the things themselves break loose
from the universal continuity of Being in general, separate themselves from the other,
and are     for themselves. Differentiae are supposed, not merely to have an essential
relation to cognition, but also the essential determinacies of things, and the artificial
system is supposed to conform to the system of nature itself and to express only this.
This is necessary from the concept of reason, and the instinct of reason—for, in this
observing, reason behaves only as instinct—has also in its systems achieved this
unity, where, namely, its objects are themselves so constituted that they have in them
an essentiality or a Being-for-itself, and are not merely accident of this instant or this
Here. The distinguishing marks of animals, e.g., are taken from their claws and teeth;
for in fact it is not only cognition that thereby distinguishes one animal from another;
but the animal itself separates itself thereby; by means of these weapons it maintains
itself for itself and detached from the universal. The plant, by contrast, does not attain
to  Being-for-itself, but merely touches the limit of individuality; it is at this limit,
therefore, where the plant displays the semblance of division into sexes, that the plant
has been catalogued and differentiated.1                 What, however, stands on a lower level
cannot itself any longer distinguish itself from another, but gets lost when it enters
into opposition. Being at rest and Being in relationship come into conflict with each
other, the thing in the latter is something other than it is according to the former,
whereas the individual consists in maintaining itself in relationship to something
else.2 What, however, is unable to do this and chemically becomes something other
than it is    empirically, confuses cognition and embroils it in the same conflict as to
whether it ought to keep to the one side or the other, since the thing itself is nothing
stable3 and in it the two sides fall apart.
    ¶247. In such systems of universal stability, the stability therefore has the signifi-
cance of being the stability both of cognition and of the things themselves. But this
expansion of the stable determinacies, each of which calmly describes the course of
---
     . (.) 

its progression and gets room to go its own way, quite as much passes over
essentially into its contrary, into the confusion of these determinacies; for the
differentia, the universal determinacy, is the unity of opposites, of the determinate
and the universal in itself; it must therefore split up into this opposition. If, now, on
one side, the determinacy gains the ascendancy over the universal in which it has its
essence, then on the other side again, the universal in turn establishes its own
domination over the determinacy, pushes the determinacy to its limit and there
mixes up its distinctions and essentialities. Observation, which kept them properly
apart and believed that in them it had something firm, sees principles encroaching
on one another, transitions and confusions forming, and what it at first took to be
just separate, it sees in this combined, and what it reckoned to be together, it sees
separated; and so this adherence to tranquil, stable Being inevitably sees itself
tormented just in its most universal determinations—e.g. what are the essential
differentiae of the animal, the plant—by instances which rob it of every determin-
ation, render mute the universality to which it had risen, and reduce it to an
observation and description devoid of thought.1
    ¶248. This observing which confines itself to the simple, or curbs the sensory
dispersion by the universal, thus             finds in its object the        confusion of its principle,
because the determinate must, by its nature, lose itself in its contrary; reason must
therefore advance from the inert determinacy which had the semblance of perman-
ence, to observing determinacy as it is in truth, viz. as relating itself to its contrary.
What are called essential differentiae are passive determinacies which, when expressed
and apprehended as simple, do not present what constitutes their nature, which is to
be vanishing moments of the movement which withdraws back into itself. Since the
reason-instinct now reaches the point of looking for the determinacy in accordance
with its nature, which is essentially to be not for itself but to pass over into the
opposite, it searches for the law and for the concept of the law; indeed, it searches
for them equally as actuality that is, but this actuality will in fact vanish for it, and the
sides of the law become pure moments or abstractions, so that the law comes to light in
the nature of the concept, which has eliminated in itself the indifferent subsistence
of sensory actuality.1
    ¶249. To the observing consciousness, the truth of the law is in experience, in the
same way that sensory Being is for consciousness; not in and for itself. But if the law
does not have its truth in the concept, then it is a contingency, not a necessity, or not
in fact a law. But the fact that the law is essentially as concept, not only does not
conflict with its presence for observation, but is rather the very reason why it has
necessary     Being-there      and is for observation. The universal, in the                   sense of the
universality of reason, is also universal in the sense involved in the concept, viz.
that the universal is for consciousness, that it presents itself as what is present and
actual, or that the concept presents itself in the mode of thinghood and sensory
Being;—but without thereby losing its nature and lapsing into inert subsistence or
indifferent succession. What is universally valid is also universally effective; what
ought to be, in fact also is, and what only ought to be without being so, has no truth.
The instinct of reason, for its part, rightly holds firmly to this, and refuses to be led
astray by figments of thought which only ought to be and, as Oughts, are supposed to
have truth, although they are nowhere met with in experience,—refuses to be led astray
---
                                                 .                                

by hypotheses any more than by all the other invisibilities of a perennial Ought; for
reason is just this certainty of having reality, and what is not for consciousness as a self-
essence, i.e. what does not appear, is for consciousness nothing at all.1
   ¶250. That the truth of law is essentially reality, no doubt again becomes, for this
consciousness which sticks to observation, an                   opposition to the concept and to the
universal in itself; or a thing such as its law is, is to it not an essence of reason; it
opines that it obtains in it something alien. But it refutes its own opinion by its deed,
in which it does not itself take its universality in the sense that all singular sensory
things would have to have shown to it the appearance of the law, in order to be able to
assert the truth of the law. That stones fall when raised above the Earth and let go, for
this it does not at all require this experiment to be made with every stone; it does
perhaps say that it must have been conducted with at least a great number, then from
this we can by analogy draw an inference about the rest with the greatest probability
or with perfect right. But analogy not only does not give a perfect right, but on
account of its nature refutes itself so often that the inference to be drawn from
analogy itself is rather that analogy does not permit any inference to be made. The
probability, which the result of analogy would come down to, loses, in face of truth,
every distinction of lesser and greater probability; let it be as great as it likes, it is
nothing as against truth. But the instinct of reason does in fact accept such laws as
truth, and it is only in relation to their necessity, which it does not recognize, that it
resorts to this distinction, and reduces the truth of the Thing itself to probability, in
order to indicate the imperfect way in which the truth is present for the conscious-
ness which has not yet attained to insight into the pure concept; for universality is
present only as simple immediate universality. But, at the same time, on account of
this universality, the law has truth for consciousness; that the stone falls, is true for
consciousness because for it the stone is heavy, that is, because in heaviness the stone
has   in and for itself     the essential relation to the Earth            which expresses itself as fall.
Consciousness thus has in experience the Being of the law, but it likewise has the law
as concept; and it is only because of both circumstances together that the law is true for
consciousness; it is valid as law because it presents itself in appearance, and is also
in its own self concept.1
   ¶251. Because the law is at the same time in itself concept, the reason-instinct of this
consciousness itself proceeds, necessarily, but without knowing that this is its aim, to
purify the law and its moments into the concept. It sets up experiments concerning the
law. On its first appearance the law presents itself impurely, enveloped in singular,
sensory Being, the concept constituting its nature immersed in empirical material. In
its experiments the reason-instinct sets out to find out what happens in such and such
circumstances. By this the law seems only to be all the more plunged in sensory Being;
but really this sensory Being gets lost in the process. The inner significance of this
investigation is to find pure conditions of the law; and this means nothing else (even if
the consciousness expressing itself in this way should opine that it means something
different by it) than to raise the law entirely into the shape of the concept, and to
eliminate all subjugation of its moments to determinate Being. For example, negative
electricity, which at         first announces itself, say, as             resin-electricity, and positive
electricity as    glass-electricity, these, as a result of experiments, lose altogether this
significance and become purely positive and negative electricity, neither of which is
---
     . (.) 

any longer attached to a particular kind of thing; and we can no longer say that there
are bodies which are positively electrical and others which are negatively electrical. In
the same way, the relationship of acid and base and their reciprocal movement
constitute a law in which these opposites appear as bodies. But these isolated things
have no actuality; the power which forces them apart cannot prevent them from at
once entering again into a process; for they are only this relation. They cannot, like a
tooth or a claw, remain for themselves and as such be pointed out. That this is their
essence, to pass over immediately into a neutral product, makes their                            Being into a
Being which is in itself sublated or into a universal Being; and acid and base have truth
only as universals. Therefore, just as glass and resin can just as well be positively as
negatively electrical, so acid and base are not bound as properties to this or that
actuality; each thing is only relatively acid or base; what seems to be a decided base or
acid gets in the so-called synsomaties the opposite significance in relation to some-
thing else.—In this way the result of the experiments sublates the moments or energies
as properties of determinate things, and frees the predicates from their subjects. These
predicates, as they are in truth, are found only as universals; because of this inde-
pendence they therefore get the name of                    matters, which are neither bodies nor
properties, and certainly we are on our guard against calling oxygen, etc., positive
and negative electricity, heat, etc., bodies.1
   ¶252. The matter, by contrast, is not a thing that is, but Being as universal, or in the
mode of the concept. Reason, which is still instinct, makes this correct distinction,
without being conscious that just by testing the law in all sensory Being, it thereby
sublates the merely sensory Being of the law, and that when it conceives the moments of
the law as     matters, their essentiality has become for the law a universal, and in this
expression is marked as an unsensory sensory, as an incorporeal and yet objective Being.1
   ¶253. We have now to see what turn its result takes for the reason-instinct, and what
new shape of observing emerges therewith. We see, as the truth of this experimenting
consciousness, the pure law, which liberates itself from sensory Being, we see it as
concept which, while present in sensory Being, moves in it independently and unre-
strained, and, while immersed in it, is free of it and simple concept. This, which is in
truth the result and essence, now emerges for this consciousness itself, but as object, and
indeed, since for it the object is precisely not a               result and is without relation to the
preceding movement, as a particular kind of object, and the relationship of conscious-
ness to it as another kind of observing.1
   ¶254. Such an object, which has the process in it in the simplicity of the concept, is
the  organic. It is this absolute fluidity in which the determinacy, through which it
would be only for another, is dissolved. If the inorganic thing has the determinacy for
its essence, and for that reason constitutes the completeness of the moments of the
concept only together with another thing, and therefore gets lost when it enters into
the movement: then in the organic essence, by contrast, all determinacies through
which it is open to an other are subjugated under the organic simple unity; none of
them emerges as essential, as free to enter into relation with an other, and conse-
quently the organic maintains itself in its relation itself.1
   ¶255. The sides of the law which the reason-instinct here proceeds to observe are,
as follows from this determination, initially organic nature and inorganic                           nature in
their relation to one another. The latter is, for organic nature, just the freedom—a

freedom opposed to the simple concept of organic nature—of the detached determin-
acies in which the individual nature is                 at the same time dissolved, and from the
continuity of which it at the same time breaks away and is for itself. Air, water, earth,
zones, and climate are such universal elements, which constitute the indeterminate
simple essence of individualities, and in which these individualities are at the same
time reflected into themselves. Neither the individuality, nor the elemental, is simply
in and for itself; on the contrary, in the independent freedom in which for observa-
tion they enter the lists against each other, they behave at the same time as essential
relations, but in such a way that the independence and mutual indifference of the two
are the predominant feature, and only in part pass into abstraction. Here, then, the
law is present as the relation of an element to the formation of the organic which, at
one time, has the elemental Being over against it, and, at another time, exhibits it
within its organic reflection. But laws of this kind—that animals belonging to the air
have the constitution of birds, those belonging to water have the constitution of fish,
that nordic animals have thick, hairy pelts, and so on—such laws at once display a
poverty which does not correspond to the organic manifold variety. Besides the fact
that organic freedom knows how to withdraw its forms from these determinations
again, and everywhere necessarily presents exceptions to such laws, or rules as we
might like to call them, this remains, even for the creatures which these laws do apply
to, such a superficial determination that even the expression of the necessity of the
laws cannot be other than superficial and does not get any further than                                 great
influence; and this does not tell us what strictly belongs to this influence and what
does not. Such relations of the organic to the elemental cannot therefore in fact be
called    laws; for,    first, as we mentioned, such a relation, in its content, does not
exhaust the range of the organic in the least, but secondly, even the moments of
the relation itself remain mutually indifferent and express no necessity. In the concept
of acid lies the concept of base, just as negative electricity lies in the concept of positive
electricity; but however often the thick, hairy pelt is                  encountered together with the
north, or the structure of           fish together with water, the structure of birds together
with air, still the concept of thick hair does not lie in the concept of north, the concept
of the structure of fish does not lie in the concept of sea, the concept of the structure of
birds does not lie in the concept of air. Because of this freedom of the two sides
with respect to each other, there are also land animals which have the essential
characteristics of a bird, of the fish, and so on. The necessity, because it cannot be
comprehended as an inner necessity of the essence, also ceases to have sensory Being-
there, and can no longer be observed in actuality, but has withdrawn from it. Having
thus no place in the real essence itself, the necessity is what is called a teleological
relation, a relation which is           external    to the related terms, and therefore really the
contrary of a law. It is the thought completely liberated from necessary nature, a
thought which abandons this necessary nature and moves above it for itself.1
    ¶256. If the above-mentioned relation of the organic to elemental nature does
not express the essence of the organic, the organic is, by contrast, contained in the
purpose-concept. It is true that, for this observing consciousness, this concept is not
the organic’s own         essence, but falls outside it, and is then only that external teleo-
logical relation. Yet the organic, as it has been determined above, is, in fact, the real
purpose itself; for since the organic itself preserves itself in the relation to another, it is
---
     . (.) 

just that natural essence in which nature reflects itself into the concept, and the
moments, separated from each other in necessity, of a cause and an effect, of an agent
and a patient, are brought together into unity, so that here something emerges not
merely as a result of necessity; but, because it has returned into itself, the last, or the
result, is just as much the            first, which begins the movement, and is to itself the
purpose, which it actualizes. The organic does not produce something but                                     only
preserves itself, or what is produced, is as much already present as it is produced. 1
   ¶257. We must examine more closely this determination, as it is in itself and as it is
for the reason-instinct, in order to see how the latter finds itself therein, but does not
recognize itself in what it           finds. The purpose-concept, then, to which observing
reason ascends, is reason’s            conscious concept, but it is also no less present as an
actuality, and is not just an           external relation of this actuality, but its              essence. This
actuality, which is itself a purpose, is related purposively to another, which means: its
relation is a contingent relation with respect to what both immediately are; immedi-
ately, both are independent and mutually indifferent. But the essence of their relation
is something other than what they thus seem to be, and their doing has another sense
than what it is       immediately       for sense-perception; the necessity is hidden in what
happens, and shows itself only in the end, but in such a way that just this end shows
that the necessity has also been what is first. The end, however, shows this priority of
itself by the fact that through the alteration that the doing has undertaken, nothing
else emerges than what was already there. Or if we start from what is first, then this in
its end or in the result of its doing, returns only to itself; and through this very fact it
demonstrates itself to be something that has its own self for its end, and thus, as first,
has already returned to itself or is              in and for itself. Therefore, what it arrives at
through the movement of its doing is itself; and that it arrives only at itself, is its self-
feeling. With this there is certainly present the distinction between what it is and what
it seeks, but this is merely the semblance of a distinction, and it is thereby concept
within its own self.1
   ¶258. But this is just how self-consciousness is constituted: it distinguishes itself
from itself in such a manner that at the same time no distinction emerges in it. Hence
it finds in the observation of organic nature nothing else than this essence, it finds
itself as a thing, as a life, but still makes a distinction between what it is itself and what
it has found, a distinction, however, which is no distinction. Just as the instinct of the
animal seeks and consumes food, but thereby brings forth nothing other than itself,
so too the instinct of reason in its quest finds only reason itself. The animal finishes
up with self-feeling. The reason-instinct, on the other hand, is at the same time self-
consciousness; but because it is only instinct it is put on one side over against
consciousness, and has its opposition in it. Its satisfaction is therefore divided by
this opposition, it does indeed find itself, viz. the purpose, and likewise this purpose
as thing. But first, for the instinct the purpose falls outside the thing, which presents
itself as purpose. Secondly, this purpose as purpose is at the same time objective, and
for the instinct therefore it does not fall within itself as consciousness either, but in
another understanding.1
   ¶259. Examined more closely, this determination lies just as much in the concept
of the thing, that of being in its own self a purpose. That is to say, it preserves itself; i.e.
it is at one and the same time its nature to conceal the necessity, and to exhibit it in
---
                                                 .                                 

the form of a contingent relation; for its freedom or its Being-for-itself is just this, to
treat its necessity as a matter of indifference; thus it presents itself as something
whose concept falls outside its Being. Similarly, reason has the necessity of intuiting
its own concept as falling outside it, hence as a thing, as something towards which it is
indifferent and which is therefore reciprocally indifferent towards reason and towards
its concept. As instinct, reason also remains inside this Being or indifference, and the
thing that expresses the concept remains for it something other than this concept,
and the concept other than the thing. Thus, for reason, the organic thing is in its own
self a purpose only in the sense that the necessity which presents itself as hidden in the
doing of the thing, since the doer behaves in it as an indifferent being-for-itself, falls
outside the organic itself.—Since, however, the organic as a purpose in its own self
cannot behave in any other way than as such a thing, it is apparent and sensorily
present that it is a purpose in its own self, and it is thus observed. The organic shows
itself to be something that preserves itself and returns and has returned into itself. But
this observing consciousness does not recognize in this Being the purpose-concept,
or the fact that the purpose-concept does not exist somewhere else in an under-
standing, but exists right here, and is as a thing. It draws a distinction between the
purpose-concept, on the one hand, and Being-for-itself and self-preservation, on the
other, a distinction which is no distinction. That it is no distinction is not for this
consciousness, but what is for it is a doing that appears contingent and indifferent
with regard to what comes about through it; and the unity which nevertheless links
the two together,—that doing and this purpose, falls asunder for this consciousness. 1
    ¶260. On this view, what belongs to the organic itself is the doing lying in the
middle between its first and last term, insofar as this doing has in it the character of
singularity. Insofar, however, as the doing has the character of universality and the
doer is equated with what is produced through it, purposive doing as such would not
belong to the organic. That singular doing, which is only a means, passes, in virtue of
its singularity, under the determination of an altogether singular or contingent
necessity. What the organic does for the preservation of itself as individual or itself
as genus is therefore, as regards this immediate content, entirely lawless, for the
universal and the concept fall outside it. Accordingly, its doing would be an empty
functioning devoid of any content within itself; it would not even be the functioning
of a machine, for this has a purpose, and its functioning therefore has a determinate
content. Abandoned in this way by the universal, it would be the activity merely of a
being as a being, i.e. an activity that is not at the same time reflected into itself, as the
activity of an acid or base is; a functioning which could not separate itself from its
immediate Being-there, nor give up this Being-there (which gets lost in the relation
to its opposite), yet still preserve itself. But the Being whose functioning is the
functioning considered here is posited as a thing that                     preserves itself in its relation
to its opposite;      the activity    as such is nothing but the pure essenceless form of its
Being-for-itself, and its substance, which is not merely determinate Being but the
universal, its     purpose, does not fall outside it; it is an activity which within itself
returns into itself, and is not turned back into itself by anything alien.1
    ¶261. However, this unity of universality and the activity is not for this observing
consciousness, because that unity is essentially the inner movement of the organic
and can only be conceived as concept; but observation seeks the moments in the
---
     . (.) 

form of Being and permanence; and because it is essential to the organic whole that
it does not have the moments in it in this form and does not let them be found in
it, consciousness converts the opposition into an opposition that conforms to its
own point of view.1
   ¶262. In this way, the organic essence arises for observing consciousness as a
relation of two fixed moments that simply are—an opposition whose two sides thus
seem, on the one hand, to be given to it in observation, and on the other hand, as
regards their content, express the opposition of the organic purpose-concept and of
actuality; but because the concept as such is effaced therein, they express them in an
obscure and superficial way, in which thought has sunk to the level of representation.
Thus we see that the concept is roughly what is meant by the                         inner, and actuality
by the outer; and their relation generates the law that the outer is the expression of
the inner1.
   ¶263. When we consider more closely this inner with its opposite and their
relation to each other, it emerges that, in the                 first place, the sides of the law no
longer function as in the case of previous laws, in which they appeared as independ-
ent things, each as a particular body; nor, in the second place, in such way that the
universal is supposed to have its existence somewhere else, outside beings. On the
contrary, the organic essence is made the foundation, entirely unseparated, as
content of the inner and outer, and is the same for both; the opposition is thus still
only a purely formal one, whose real sides have the same in-itself for their essence,
but at the same time, since inner and outer are also an opposed reality and a diverse
Being for observation, they each seem to observation to have a peculiar content of
their own. However, this peculiar content, since it is the same substance or organic
unity, can in fact only be a diverse form of that substance, of that unity; and this is
implied by the observing consciousness when it says that the outer is merely the
expression of the inner.—These are the same determinations of the relationship, viz.
the indifferent independence of the diverse terms and their unity in that independ-
ence, a unity in which they vanish, that we have seen in the purpose-concept.1
   ¶264. We have now to see what shape the inner and outer have in their Being. The
inner as such must have an outer Being and a shape, just as much as the outer as such;
for it is an object, or is itself posited as being and as present for observation.1
   ¶265. The organic substance as inner is the simple soul, the pure purpose-concept
or the    universal, which in its partition equally remains a universal                       fluidity, and
therefore appears in its Being as the doing or the movement of the vanishing actuality;
whereas the outer, opposed to that inner that simply is, consists in the quiescent Being
of the organic. The law, as the relation of that inner to this outer, thus expresses its
content, once in the presentation of universal moments or                      simple essentialities, and
again in the presentation of the actualized essentiality or the shape. Those first simple
organic properties, if we may call them that, are sensibility, irritability, and reproduc-
tion. These properties, at least the first two, seem indeed to relate not to the organism
in general, but only to the animal organism. In fact the vegetable organism also
expresses only the simple concept of the organism, which                            does not develop        its
moments; consequently, in regard to those moments, so far as they are supposed to
be for observation, we must confine ourselves to the organism which presents their
developed Being-there.1
---
                                                 .                                

   ¶266. Now, as regards these moments themselves, they immediately emerge from
the concept of the end-in-itself. For sensibility expresses in general the simple concept
of organic reflection into itself, or the universal fluidity of this concept, while irrit-
ability  expresses organic elasticity, the capacity, in reflection, at the same time to
behave reactively, and the actualization opposed to the initial quiescent Being-within-
itself, an actualization in which that abstract Being-for-itself is a Being for another.
Reproduction, however, is the action of this                whole    organism reflected into itself, its
activity as purpose in itself, or as genus, in which the individual thus repels itself from
itself, and reproduces, by engendering them, either its organic parts or the whole
individual. Reproduction, taken in the meaning of                          self-preservation in general,
expresses the formal concept of the organic, or sensibility; but it is, strictly speaking,
the real organic concept, or the whole, which returns into itself, either as the individual
by producing the singular parts of itself, or, as genus, by producing individuals.1
   ¶267. The other meaning of these organic elements, viz. as the outer, is the mode of
their shape, according to which they are present as actual parts, but at the same time
as universal parts or organic systems; sensibility, say, as a nervous system, irritability
as a muscular system, reproduction as viscera for the preservation of the individual
and the genus.1
   ¶268. Laws peculiar to the organic accordingly concern a relationship of the organic
moments in their twofold meaning, once as being a part of the organic structure, and
again as being a universal fluid determinacy which pervades all those systems. Thus, in
the expression of such a law, a determinate sensibility, e.g., as a moment of the whole
organism, would have its expression in a determinately formed nervous system, or it
would also be linked with a determinate                   reproduction      of the organic parts of the
individual or with the propagation of the whole individual, and so on.—Both sides of
such a law can be observed. The outer, in accordance with its concept, is                            Being for
another; sensibility, e.g., has its immediately actualized mode in the sensitive system;
and, as a universal property, it is in its externalizations equally something objective. The
side which is called the inner has its own outer side, which is distinct from what is called
the outer in the whole.1
   ¶269. Both sides of an organic law would thus no doubt be observable, but not the
laws of their relation; and observation does not suffice, not because, as observation, it
is too short-sighted and we ought not to proceed empirically but ought to start from
the Idea; for such laws, if they were something real, would have in fact to be actually
present and therefore observable; but rather because the thought of laws of this kind
proves to have no truth.
   ¶270. There turned out to be a law in the relationship according to which the
universal organic property in an organic system had made itself into a thing, and in
this thing had a structured imprint, so that both were the same essence, present once
as a universal moment, and again as a thing. But, in addition, the side of the inner is,
for itself, also a relationship of several sides; and consequently there presents itself, to
begin with, the thought of a law as a relation to one another of the universal organic
activities or properties. Whether such a law is possible must be decided from the
nature of such a property. However, such a property as a universal                             fluidity is, on
the one hand, not something that is limited in the manner of a thing and sticks to the
difference of a Being-there which is supposed to constitute its shape; sensibility
---
      . (.) 

extends beyond the nervous system and permeates all other systems of the organism;—
on the other hand, this property is a universal                         moment, which is essentially
unseparated and inseparable from reaction or irritability, and from reproduction.
For, as reflection into itself, it purely and simply has reaction in it. Mere reflectedness
into itself is passivity or dead Being, not a sensibility; any more than action, which is
the same as reaction, without reflectedness into itself, is irritability. It is precisely
reflection in action or reaction, and action or reaction in reflection, whose unity
constitutes the organic, a unity which is synonymous with organic reproduction. It
follows from this that, in every mode of actuality, the same quantity of sensibility as
of irritability must be present—since to begin with we are considering the relation-
ship of sensibility and irritability to one another—and that an organic phenomenon
can be apprehended and determined or, if you like, explained, just as much in terms
of the one as of the other. What one person takes, say, for high sensibility, another
may equally well consider as high irritability, and irritability of the same degree. If
they are called       factors, and this is not to be a meaningless word, they are thereby
declared to be moments of the                  concept; thus the real object whose essence is
constituted by this concept, has them in it in an equal way, and if the object is
determined in the one way as very sensitive, it must also be declared, in the other way,
to be equally irritable.1
    ¶271. If sensibility and irritability are distinguished, as is necessary, then they
are distinguished in accordance with the concept, and their opposition is qualitative.
But when, apart from this true difference, they are also posited as beings and diverse
for representation, such that they could be sides of the law, then they appear in
quantitative diversity. Their peculiar qualitative opposition thus enters into magni-
tude, and there arise laws of the kind, for example, that sensibility and irritability
stand in an inverse relationship of their magnitude, so that as the one grows the other
decreases; or better, taking directly the magnitude itself as the content, that the size of
something increases as its smallness decreases.—But if a determinate content is given
to this law, say, that the size of a hole increases, the more what it is filled with decreases,
then this inverse relationship can equally be changed into a direct relationship and
expressed by saying that the size of the hole increases in direct relationship to the
amount taken away;—a tautological proposition, whether expressed as a direct or an
inverse relationship, a proposition which in its peculiar expression means simply this,
that a quantity increases as this quantity increases. Just as the hole, and what fills it and
is taken away, are qualitatively opposed, but what is real in them, and its determinate
quantity, is one and the same in both, and similarly, increase of magnitude and
decrease of smallness are the same, and their meaningless opposition amounts to a
tautology: so are the organic moments equally inseparable in their reality and in
their magnitude, which is the magnitude of that reality; one decreases only with the
other and increases only with it, for one purely and simply has meaning only insofar
as the other is present;—or rather, it is a matter of indifference whether an organic
phenomenon is considered as irritability or as sensibility; this is so in general, and
equally when its magnitude is under discussion. Similarly, it is a matter of indiffer-
ence whether we speak of the increase of a hole as an augmentation of the hole as the
emptiness, or as an augmentation of the filling removed. Or a number, e.g. three,
remains equally large whether I take it positively or negatively, and if I enlarge the

three to four, then both the positive and the negative have become four,—just as the
south pole of a magnet is exactly as strong as its north pole, or a positive electricity,
or an acid, is exactly as strong as its negative, or the base on which it acts.—An
organic Being-there is just such a magnitude as that three, or a magnet, etc.; it is that
which is augmented or diminished, and when it is augmented both its factors are
augmented, just as both poles of the magnet or both electricities increase if a magnet,
etc., is strengthened.—That the two can be diverse just as little in                          intension  and
extension, that the one cannot decrease in extension but increase in intension, while
the other, conversely, is supposed to diminish its intension but increase in extension,
falls under the same concept of empty opposition; the real intension is purely and
simply as great as the extension, and vice versa.1
    ¶272. It is evident that what really happens in this law-giving is that at the outset
irritability and sensibility constitute the determinate organic opposition; but this
content gets lost and the opposition degenerates into the formal opposition of
increase and decrease of quantity, or of diverse intension and extension,—an oppos-
ition which no longer has anything to do with the nature of sensibility and irritability,
and no longer expresses it. Hence such an empty game of law-giving is not confined
to the organic moments but can be played everywhere and with everything, and rests
in general on unfamiliarity with the logical nature of these oppositions.1
    ¶273. Finally, if instead of sensibility and irritability, reproduction is brought into
relation with one or the other of them, then even the occasion for this law-giving falls
away; for reproduction does not stand in opposition to those moments as they do to
one another; and since this law-giving is based on such an opposition, here even the
semblance of its taking place falls away.
    ¶274. The law-giving just considered contains the differences of the organism in
their significance as moments of its               concept, and strictly speaking should be an a
priori law-giving. But the law-giving itself essentially involves this thought, that those
differences have the significance of              present givens, and that the merely observing
consciousness has, in any case, to confine itself only to their Being-there. The organic
actuality necessarily contains such an opposition as its concept expresses, and which
can be determined as irritability and sensibility, as both of these in turn appear
diverse from reproduction.—The                externality     in which the moments of the organic
concept are here considered is the inner’s own immediate externality, not the outer
which is the outer of the whole, and is shape, and in relation with which the inner is
to be considered later on.1
    ¶275. If, however, the opposition of the moments is conceived as it is in Being-
there, then sensibility, irritability, reproduction, sink down                   to the level of common
properties, which are universalities equally indifferent towards one another as are
determinate weight, colour, hardness, etc. In this sense it may well be observed that
an organic entity is more sensitive or more irritable or of greater reproductive force
than another,—just as we may observe that the sensibility, etc., of one is diverse in
kind from that of another, that one reacts differently to determinate stimuli than
another, as a horse reacts differently to oats than to hay, and a dog again differently to
both, etc., differences as readily observable as that one body is harder than another,
and so on.—But these sensory properties, hardness, colour, etc., as also the phenom-
ena of receptivity to the stimulus of oats, of irritability in response to loads, or of the
---

number and kind of young produced, when they are related to one another and
compared among themselves, essentially conflict with any conformity to a law. For
the determinacy of their           sensory Being      just consists in their existing in complete
mutual indifference, and displaying the freedom of nature released from the concept
rather than the unity of a relation, displaying their irrational playing up and down on
the scale of contingent magnitude between the moments of the concept, rather than
these moments themselves.1
   ¶276. The       other   side, according to which the simple moments of the organic
concept are compared with the moments of the                       structure, would       first furnish the
authentic law expressing the true outer as a copy of the inner.—Now, because those
simple moments are interpenetrating fluid properties, they do not have in the organic
thing such a separate, real expression as what is called a singular system of the shape.
Or if the abstract Idea of the organism is genuinely expressed in those three
moments, merely because they are not anything static, but only moments of the
concept and of movement, then the organism, on the other hand, as a structure, is
not captured in three such determinate systems as anatomy explicates them. Insofar
as such systems are supposed to be found in their actuality, and to be legitimated by
being so found, it must also be borne in mind that anatomy presents us not only with
three such systems but with a good many more.—Furthermore, apart from this, the
system of sensibility in general must mean something quite different from what is
called the    nervous system, similarly the irritable              system    something different from
the muscular system, the reproductive system something different from the viscera of
reproduction. In the systems of             shape as such, the organism is apprehended from
the abstract side of dead existence; its moments, taken in this way, belong to anatomy
and the cadaver, not to cognition and the living organism. As such parts, the
moments have really ceased to be, for they cease to be processes. Since the Being of the
organism is essentially universality or reflection into itself, the Being of its whole, like its
moments, cannot consist in an anatomical system; on the contrary, the actual expression
of the whole, and the externalization of its moments, are really present only as a
movement which runs its course through the various parts of the structure, a movement
in which what is carved out and fixed as a singular system essentially displays itself as
a fluid moment; consequently, this actuality, as anatomy finds it, must not rank as their
reality, but only that actuality as a process, in which alone even the anatomical parts
make any sense.1
   ¶277. It emerges, then,          first that the moments of the organic                 inner, taken for
themselves, are incapable of furnishing the sides of a law of Being, since in such a law
the sides should be able to be asserted of a Being-there, to be distinguished from one
another, and neither side able to be equally named in place of the other; and secondly,
that, placed on one side, the moments do not have in the other side their realization
in a   fixed system; for such a system is no more something that would have any
organic truth than it is the expression of those moments of the inner. The essence of
the organic, since it is in itself the universal, rather consists in general in having its
moments just as universal in actuality, i.e. as pervasive processes, but not in giving an
image of the universal in an isolated thing.
   ¶278. In this way the representation of a law in the organic gets lost altogether. The
law wants to grasp and express the opposition as inert sides, and in them the
---
                                                 .                             

determinacy which is their relation to one another. The inner, to which the appearing
universality belongs, and the outer, to which belong the parts of the inert shape, were
supposed to constitute the corresponding sides of the law, but as thus held apart, they
lose their organic significance; and what underlies the representation of law is
precisely this, that each of its two sides should have an indifferent subsistence that
is for itself, the relation being shared between them as a twofold determinacy
corresponding to that relation. Whereas each side of the organic is intrinsically just
this: to be simple universality in which all determinations are dissolved, and to be the
movement of this dissolution.1
    ¶279. Insight into the difference between this law-giving and previous forms will
make its nature perfectly clear.—If, namely, we look back to the movement of
perceiving and of the understanding, which in perception reflects itself into itself
and thereby determines its object, the understanding does not there have before
itself in its object the relation of these abstract determinations, of the universal and
singular, of the essential and the external: it is itself the transition, to which this
transition does not become objective. Here, by contrast, the organic unity, i.e. just
the relation of those opposites,—and this relation is pure transition—is itself the
object. This transition in its simplicity is immediately                   universality; and since this
universality enters into the difference whose relation the law is supposed to express,
its moments, as universal, are objects of this consciousness, and the law runs: the
outer    is the expression of the           inner. Here, the understanding has grasped                    the
thought of the law itself, whereas previously it only looked for laws generally, and
the moments of the laws occurred to it as a determinate content, not as the thoughts
of the laws.—As regards the content, then, the laws obtained here ought not to be
such as are merely a tranquil admission of differences that simply are into the form
of universality, but laws which immediately have in these differences the unrest of
the concept too, and consequently at the same time have the necessity of the relation
between the sides. But just because the object, the organic unity, immediately unites the
infinite sublation or the absolute negation of Being with inert Being, and the moments
are essentially pure transition, no sides that simply
for the law.1                                                        are emerge such as are required
    ¶280. In order to obtain such sides, the understanding must keep to the other
moment of the organic relationship, viz. to the reflectedness of organic Being-there
into itself. But this Being is so completely reflected into itself that no determinacy
with regard to another is left over for it. The immediate sensory Being is immediately
one with the determinacy as such, and therefore expresses a qualitative difference
in that Being, as e.g. blue in contrast to red, acid in contrast to alkaline, and so on.
But the organic Being that has returned into itself is completely indifferent towards
another, its Being-there is a simple universality and denies to observation any
lasting sensory differences or, what is the same thing, displays its essential determin-
acy only as the exchange of determinacies that are. Consequently, the way in which
difference expresses itself as being is just this, that it is an indifferent difference, i.e.
difference as magnitude. In this, however, the concept is extinguished and necessity has
vanished.—But the content and                filling of this indifferent Being, the exchange of
sensory determinations, gathered together into the simplicity of an organic deter-
mination, then expresses this at the same time, that the content really does not have
---
     . (.) 

that determinacy—that of the immediate property—, and the qualitative element
falls solely in the magnitude, as we saw above.1
   ¶281. Although, then, the objective element, which is apprehended as organic
determinacy, has the concept within itself and thereby distinguishes itself from what
is for the understanding that, in apprehending the content of its laws, behaves as
purely perceptual, nevertheless this apprehension relapses entirely into the principle
and the manner of the merely perceiving understanding, for the reason that what is
apprehended is utilized as moments of a                   law; for what is apprehended thereby
acquires the mode of a fixed determinacy, the form of an immediate property or of
an inert appearance, it is, furthermore, received into the determination of magnitude
and the nature of the concept is suppressed.—The conversion of something merely
perceived into something reflected into itself, of a merely sensory determinacy into
an organic determinacy, thus loses its value again, and loses it by the fact that the
understanding has not yet sublated law-giving.1
   ¶282. To draw the comparison with regard to this conversion by some examples,
perhaps something which for perception is an animal with strong muscles is deter-
mined as an animal organism of high irritability, or what for perception is a
condition of great weakness is determined as a condition of high sensibility, or, if
one prefers, as an abnormal affection and, indeed, an exponentiation of it (expres-
sions which translate the sensory facts into Latin, and a bad Latin at that, instead of
into the concept). That an animal has strong muscles may also be expressed by the
understanding by saying that the animal possesses a great                        muscular force,—and
similarly, great weakness as a slight force. Determination in terms of irritability has
this advantage over determination as force, that the latter expresses indeterminate,
but the former determinate, reflection into itself, for the                      peculiar    force of the
muscle is precisely irritability,—and it has the advantage over determination by
strong muscles, that reflection into itself is at the same time contained in it, as it
already is in force. Similarly, weakness or slight force,              organic passivity,     finds deter-
minate expression in terms of sensibility. But when this sensibility is so taken for itself
and   fixed and, in addition, is bound up with                magnitude      and, as greater or lesser
sensibility, is opposed to a greater or lesser irritability, each is wholly reduced into
the sensory element and to the ordinary form of a property, and their relation
is not the concept but, on the contrary,                 magnitude, into which the opposition
now falls and becomes a thoughtless difference. Though the indeterminacy of the
expressions      force  and    strength    and    weakness     was thereby removed, there now
arises the equally empty and indeterminate dabbling in the oppositions of a higher
and lower sensibility and irritability, in their ascent and descent relatively to one
another. Just as strength and weakness are entirely sensory thoughtless determin-
ations, greater or lesser sensibility and irritability are no less the sensory appearance
thoughtlessly apprehended and likewise expressed. Those conceptless expressions
have not been replaced by the concept; instead, strength and weakness have been
filled with a determination which, taken solely for itself, is based on the concept
and has it as its content, but loses completely this origin and character.—By the
form of simplicity and immediacy in which this content is made into the side of a
law, and by the magnitude that constitutes the element of the difference of such
determinations, the essence, which is originally as concept and posited as concept,
---
                                                 .                                

retains the mode of sensory perceiving, and remains as far removed from cognition
as it was in the determination by strength and weakness of force or by immediate
sensory properties.1
    ¶283. Now there still remains to be considered, for itself alone, what the outer of
the organic is, and how in it the opposition of its inner and outer determines itself;
just as at first the inner of the whole in relation to its own outer was considered. 1
    ¶284. The outer, considered for itself, is the structure in general, the system of life
articulating itself in the element of Being, and at the same time essentially the Being
of the organic essence for an other,—objective essence in its Being-for-itself.—This
other    appears initially as its outer inorganic nature. If these two are considered
in relation to a law, the inorganic nature cannot, as we saw above, constitute
the side of a law over against the organic essence, because the latter is at the
same time purely and simply for itself, and has a universal and free relation to
inorganic nature.1
    ¶285. However, if the relationship of these two sides in the organic shape itself is
determined more closely, then this shape is, on one side, turned against the inorganic
nature, while on the other side it is              for itself   and reflected into itself. The           actual
organic essence is the middle term which unites the                     Being-for-itself of life, with the
outer in general or Being-in-itself.—The extreme of Being-for-itself is, however, the
inner as infinite One, which takes back into itself, out of their subsistence and
connection with the outer, the moments of the shape itself; this extreme, devoid of
content of its own, gives itself its content in the shape and appears in the shape as its
process. In this extreme as simple negativity or pure singularity, the organic has its
absolute freedom in virtue of which it is indifferent and secured with regard to Being
for another, and with regard to the determinacy of the moments of the shape. This
freedom is at the same time freedom of the moments themselves, it is their possibility
of appearing, and Being apprehended, as                     being-there,     and in this they are also
liberated and indifferent with regard to one another, just as they are with regard to
the outer, for the simplicity of this freedom is Being or their simple substance. This
concept, or pure freedom, is one and the same life, however varied the play in which
the shape or the Being for another may rove about; it is a matter of indifference to this
stream of life what kind of mills it drives.—Now, in the first place it is to be noted that
this concept is not to be conceived here as it was formerly, when we were considering
the proper inner in its form of process or of the development of its moments, but in its
form as simple inner, which constitutes the purely universal side in contrast to the
actual living essence, or as the           element in which the members of the shape, which
simply are, have their subsistence; for it is this shape that we are considering here, and
in it the essence of life is as the simplicity of subsistence. In the next place, the Being
for another, or the determinacy of the actual structure, is taken up into this simple
universality which is its essence, a determinacy which is equally simple, universal,
and non-sensory, and can only be the determinacy which is expressed as number.—
The number is the middle term of the shape which links the indeterminate life with
the actual life, simple like the former and determinate like the latter. That which in
the former, the       inner, would be as number, the outer would have to express in its
fashion as multiform actuality, manner of life, colour, etc., in general as the entire
host of differences which develop in appearance.1
---
     . (.) 

   ¶286. If the two sides of the organic whole—the one being the                           inner, while the
other is the outer, in such a way that each again has within its own self an inner and
outer—are compared with respect to the inner which each side has, then the inner of
the first side was the concept as the unrest of abstraction; the second, however, has for
its inner a quiescent universality and in it also a quiescent determinacy, number. If,
therefore, the      first side, because the concept develops its moments in it, made a
deceptive promise of laws on account of the semblance of necessity of the relation,
the second directly renounces this, since number shows itself to be the determination
of one side of its laws. For number is just that completely quiescent, lifeless, and
indifferent determinacy in which all movement and relation is extinguished, and
which has broken the bridge to the vitality of drives, the manner of life, and the rest of
sensory Being-there.1
   ¶287. But to consider the shape of the organic as such and the inner as an inner
merely of the shape, is in fact no longer to consider the organic. For the two sides
which were supposed to be related are posited in only an indifferent manner towards
each other, and the reflection into itself, which constitutes the essence of the organic,
is thereby sublated. What really happens here is that the attempted comparison of
inner and outer is transferred to inorganic nature; here the infinite concept is only the
essence, which is concealed inside, or falls outside in self-consciousness, and no
longer, as in the organic, has its objective presence. This relation of inner and
outer has thus still to be considered in its own proper sphere.1
   ¶288. In the first place, that inner of shape, as the simple singularity of an inorganic
thing, is the specific gravity. As simple Being, it can be observed just as well as the
determinacy of number, of which alone it is capable, or, strictly speaking, it can be
found by comparing observations and it seems in this way to give one side of the law.
Shape, colour, hardness, toughness, and a countless host of other properties would
together constitute the outer side, and would have to express the determinacy of the
inner, the number, so that the one side would have its counterpart in the other.1
   ¶289. Now, because negativity is conceived here not as movement of the process,
but as unity     brought to rest       or simple Being-for-itself, it appears rather as that by
which the thing resists the process and preserves itself within itself as indifferent
towards it. But in virtue of the fact that this simple Being-for-itself is a tranquil
indifference towards another, specific gravity takes its place as one property alongside
others; and with that, all necessary relation of it to this plurality, or all conformity to
law, ceases.—Specific gravity, as this simple inner, does not have difference within
itself, or it has only the unessential difference; for it is just its                 pure simplicity      that
sublates all essential differentiation. This unessential difference,                    magnitude, would
therefore have to have its counterpart or the                  other   in the other side, which is the
plurality of properties, since it is only in this way that it is difference at all. If this
plurality itself is concentrated into the simplicity of the opposition, and determined,
say, as   cohesion, so that this cohesion is the for-itself in otherness                    (just as specific
gravity is pure Being-for-itself ), then this cohesion is at first the pure determinacy
posited in the concept in contrast to that other determinacy, and the manner of law-
giving would be that which we considered above, concerning the relation of sens-
ibility to irritability.—In the next place, cohesion, as                 concept    of Being-for-itself in
otherness, is further only the abstraction               of the side standing over against specific
---
                                                 .                       

gravity, and as such has no existence. For Being-for-itself in otherness is the process
in which the inorganic would have to express its Being-for-itself as a self-preservation,
which would secure it from emerging from the process as moment of a product.
But just this is contrary to its nature, which has no purpose or universality within
itself. Its process, rather, is merely the determinate behaviour in which its Being-for-
itself, its specific gravity,       sublates    itself. But this determinate behaviour itself, in
which its cohesion would subsist in its true concept, and the determinate magnitude
of its specific gravity, are concepts completely indifferent towards each other. If
the type of behaviour were left out of account, and our attention confined to the
representation of magnitude, then we could perhaps think of the determination like
this, that a greater specific weight, as a superior Being-within-itself, would resist
involvement in the process more than would a smaller specific weight. But, con-
versely, the freedom of Being-for-itself only proves itself in the facility with which it
meshes with everything, and preserves itself in this multiplicity. This intensity
without extension of relations is a hollow abstraction, for extension constitutes the
Being-there of intension. But the self-preservation of the inorganic in its relation falls,
as we have noted, outside the nature of this relation, since the inorganic does not
contain within itself the principle of movement, or because its Being is not absolute
negativity and concept.1
    ¶290. This other side of the inorganic, by contrast, when considered not as process
but as quiescent Being, is ordinary cohesion, a simple sensory property occupying the
side facing the liberated moment of otherness, which is dispersed into a number of
indifferent properties, and, like specific gravity, enters among these properties them-
selves; the multiplicity of properties together then constitutes the other side facing
this side. In this, however, as in the other properties, number is the sole determinacy,
and this not only does not express a relation and a transition of these properties to
one another, but is essentially just this: to have no necessary relation, but to present
the abolition of all conformity to law; for number is the expression of determinacy
as an    unessential    determinacy. This being so, then a series of bodies in which the
difference is expressed as a numerical difference of their specific gravities by no
means runs parallel to a series in which the difference is that of the other properties,
even if, to facilitate the Thing, only one or some of these properties are taken. For in
fact it is only the entire bundle of properties that could constitute the other side in
this parallel. To put this bundle in order internally and bind it into a whole,
observation has available, on the one hand, the determinacies of magnitude of
these various properties, but on the other hand, their differences come into play as
qualitative. Now in this heap of properties, what would have to be designated as
positive or negative and would mutually sublate each other—in general, the internal
figuration and exposition of the formula, which would be very complex—would
belong to the concept, but the concept is excluded by the very manner in which
the properties are supposed to be lying there, and to be taken up, as just being; in this
Being, no property displays the character of a negative with regard to the other; on
the contrary, one property is just as well as the other is, nor does it indicate otherwise
its place in the arrangement of the whole.—In the case of a series which progresses
with parallel differences—whether the relationship is meant as increasing on both
sides at once, or increasing only on one side and decreasing on the other,—what is of
---
     . (.) 

interest is only the         final  simple expression of this combined whole, which was
supposed to constitute one side of the law over against specific gravity; but this one
side, as a    result that just is, is precisely nothing other than what has already been
mentioned, viz. a single property, as, say, ordinary cohesion is as well, alongside
which the others, specific gravity among them, are indifferently present, and each of
the others can with equal right, i.e. with equal injustice, be chosen as the represen-
tative of the entire other side; the one, like the other, would merely represent
[repräsentieren], in German,             vorstellen, the essence, but would not be the Thing
itself. So that the attempt to find series of bodies which would run in simple parallel
and would express the essential nature of the bodies according to a law of these sides
must be regarded as a thought that is ignorant of its task and of the means whereby it
should be carried out.1
   ¶291. Previously, the relation of the inner and outer in the shape, which is supposed
to present itself to observation, was straightaway transferred to the sphere of the
inorganic; the determination which draws it in this direction can now be more
precisely indicated, and there emerges from there still another form and relation of
this relationship. That is to say, what in the case of the inorganic seems to offer the
possibility of such a comparison of the inner and outer, falls away entirely in the case of
the organic. The inorganic inner is a simple inner which offers itself for perception as a
property that just is; its determinacy is therefore essentially magnitude, and this inner
appears, as a property that just is, indifferent towards the outer, or the many other
sensory properties. But the Being-for-itself of the organic living creature does not
take its place on one side in this way over against its outer; on the contrary, it has within
itself the principle of         otherness. If we determine Being-for-itself as                    simple, self-
preserving relation to itself, then its otherness is simple negativity; and organic unity
is the unity of a relating-to-itself that is equal-to-itself, and of pure negativity. This
unity is, as unity, the inwardness of the organic; this is thereby in itself universal, or it is
genus. But the freedom of the genus, in the face of its actuality, is different from the
freedom of specific gravity in the face of the shape. The freedom of specific gravity is a
freedom that just is, or such that it takes its place on one side as a particular property.
But because it is a freedom that just is, it is also only one determinacy which essentially
belongs to this shape, or whereby this shape,                   as essence, is something determinate.
The freedom of the genus, however, is a universal freedom and is indifferent towards
this shape or towards its actuality. The determinacy, which attaches to the Being-for-
itself, as such, of the inorganic, therefore falls, in the organic, under its Being-for-itself,
just as, in the inorganic, it falls only under the Being of the inorganic; hence, although
the determinacy, already in the inorganic, is at the same time only as a property, yet
it acquires the dignity of the essence, because, as the simple negative, it stands over
against Being-there as Being for another; and this simple negative is, in its ultimate
singular determinacy, a number. The organic, however, is a singularity, which is itself
pure negativity, and therefore exterminates within itself the                        fixed determinacy of
number, which attaches to            indifferent Being. Insofar as it has within it the moment
of indifferent Being, including the moment of number, the number can thus be taken
as merely a playful diversion, but not as the essence of its vitality.1
   ¶292. But now, though pure negativity, the principle of the process, does not fall
outside the organic, and the organic therefore does not have this negativity as a
---
                                                 .                               

determinacy in its        essence, but the singularity itself is universal in itself, yet in the
organic this pure singularity is not developed and actual in its moments as them-
selves abstract or universal. On the contrary, this expression withdraws outside that
universality, which falls back into inwardness; and between the actuality or shape, i.e.
the self-developing singularity, and the organic universal or the genus, there comes
the   determinate universal, the species. The existence, to which the negativity of the
universal or of the genus attain, is only the developed movement of a process which
runs its course in the           parts of the shape that just is. If the genus, as quiescent
simplicity, had within it the differentiated parts, and if, in consequence, its                         simple
negativity as such were at the same time a movement which ran through parts which
were equally simple and immediately universal within themselves, parts which here
were actual as such moments, then the organic genus would be consciousness. But, as
it is, the simple determinacy, as determinacy of the species, is present in the genus in
an unspiritual manner; actuality starts from the genus, or what enters into actuality is
not the genus as such, i.e. is not the thought at all. The genus as organic actuality
is merely replaced by a representative. This representative, number, seems to mark
the transition from the genus into the individual structure, and to provide observa-
tion with the two sides of the necessity, once as simple determinacy, and once again
as developed shape, brought forth to manifold variety; but this number really marks
the indifference and freedom of the universal and the singular with regard to one
another, a singular that is abandoned by the genus to the essenceless difference of
magnitude, but the singular itself, as a living creature, proves to be equally free from
this difference. True universality, as we have determined it, is here only inner essence;
as determinacy of the species it is a formal universality, and, over against this, that true
universality takes its stand on the side of singularity, which is thereby a living
singularity and, in virtue of its           inner, overrides its determinacy as species. But this
singularity is not at the same time a universal individual, i.e. one in which the
universality would have outer actuality as well; the universal individual falls outside
the living organism. This            universal     individual, however, as it is           immediately      the
individual of natural structures, is not consciousness itself; its Being-there as singular
organic living individual could not fall outside it if were supposed to be consciousness.1
    ¶293. Consequently, we see a syllogism in which one extreme is the universal life as
a universal or as genus, while the other extreme is the same universal as a singular, or
as a universal individual; but the middle term is composed of both extremes: the first
seems to fit into it as a determinate universality or as species, while the other seems to
fit in as strict or singular singularity.—And since this syllogism pertains in general to
the side of the
inorganic nature.1structure, it equally comprehends within it what is differentiated as
    ¶294. Now, since the universal life, as               the simple essence of the genus, develops
from its side the differences of the concept, and must exhibit them as a series of
simple determinacies, this series is a system of differences posited as indifferent, or a
numerical series. Whereas previously the organic in the form of singularity was set
over against this essenceless difference, which neither expresses nor contains its
living nature—and whereas just the same must be said in respect of the inorganic, in
accordance with its whole Being-there, developed in the multitude of its properties,—
it is now the universal individual we have to consider, not only as free from any
---
     . (.) 

articulation of the genus, but also as the power over the genus. The genus, which
splits up into species according to the universal determinacy of number, or may adopt
as its basis of division singular determinacies of its Being-there, e.g. shape, colour,
etc., suffers violence in this peaceful enterprise from the side of the universal
individual, the Earth, which, as the universal negativity, enforces against the system-
atization of the genus the differences, such as the Earth has them in itself, and whose
nature, because of the substance to which they belong, is another nature than that of
the genus. This doing of the genus comes to be a quite limited enterprise which it may
carry on only inside those powerful elements, and which becomes interrupted,
incomplete, and stunted everywhere owing to their unbridled violence.1
    ¶295. It follows from this that in shaped Being-there observation can encounter
reason only as life in general, a life, however, which in its differentiating does not
actually have any rational ordering and articulation in itself, and is not an imma-
nently grounded system of shapes. If, in the syllogism of organic structure, the middle
term, which contains the species and its actuality as a singular individuality, had
within itself the extremes of inner universality and of universal individuality, then
this middle term would have in the movement of its actuality the expression and the
nature of universality, and would be the self-systematizing development.—Thus
consciousness has, as the middle term between the universal spirit and its singularity
or sensory consciousness, the system of structures of consciousness, as a life of the
spirit organizing itself into a whole—the system that we are considering here, and
which has its objective Being-there as world-history. But organic nature has no
history; it falls from its universal, from life, immediately down into the singularity
of Being-there, and the moments of simple determinacy and of singular vitality,
united in this actuality, bring forth Becoming merely as the contingent movement, in
which each moment is active in its own part and the whole is preserved; but this
mobility is limited for itself only to its point, because the whole is not present in this
point, and it is not present in it because here the whole is not as a whole for itself.1
    ¶296. Apart, then, from the fact that in organic nature observing reason attains
only to the intuition of itself as universal life in general, it gets the intuition of life’s
development and actualization only in accordance with systems differentiated quite
universally, systems whose determination, their essence, lies not in the organic as
such, but in the universal individual; and under the auspices of these differences of the
Earth, in accordance with the series which the genus attempts to establish.1
    ¶297. Since, then, the universality of organic life in its actuality allows itself to fall
down immediately into the extreme of singularity                      without the genuine mediation
that is for-itself, the observing reason has before it, as a thing, only meaning; and if
reason can take an idle interest in observing this meaning, it is limited to the
description and narration of the meanings and whims of nature. This unspiritual
freedom of meaning will, it is true, offer everywhere the beginnings of laws, traces of
necessity, allusions to order and sequence, ingenious and plausible relations. But, as
regards law and necessity, when observation relates the organic with the differences
of the inorganic that just are, the elements, zones, and climates, it does not get beyond
great influence. So, too, on the other side, where individuality has the significance, not
of the Earth, but of the          oneness immanent          in organic life, where this oneness, in
immediate unity with the universal, does indeed constitute the genus, the simple
---

unity of which, however, for that very reason determines itself only as number, and
therefore sets free the qualitative appearance,—on this other side observation
cannot get beyond          smart remarks, interesting relations, friendly approaches to the
concept. But smart remarks are not a knowledge of necessity, interesting relations go
no further than interest, while the interest is still nothing more than the opinion of
reason; and the friendliness of what is individual, with which it alludes to a concept,
is a childlike friendliness which is childish if it wants to be, or purports to be, valid
in and for itself.1

¶298. Observation of nature              finds the concept realized in inorganic nature, laws
whose moments are things which, at the same time, behave as abstractions; but this
concept is not a simplicity reflected into itself. The life of organic nature, by contrast,
is only this simplicity reflected into itself; the opposition of itself, as the universal
and the singular, does not split up in the essence of this life itself; the essence is not
the genus which, in its undifferentiated element, would be separate and move itself,
and at the same time would be, for itself, undifferentiated in its opposition. Obser-
vation finds this free concept, whose universality contains developed singularity just
as absolutely within itself, only in the concept itself existing as concept, or in self-
consciousness.1
    ¶299. When observation now turns in upon itself and focuses on the actual
concept as free concept, it finds, to begin with, the laws of thinking. This singularity
which thinking is within its own self is the abstract movement of the negative, a
movement wholly retracted into simplicity, and the laws are outside reality.—That
they have no reality, means, in general, nothing else than that they lack truth. They
are indeed not supposed to be the entire truth either, but nevertheless formal truth.
But what is purely formal without reality is the figment of thought, or the empty
abstraction, without the bifurcation in it which would be nothing other than the
content.—On the other hand, however, since they are laws of pure thinking, but pure
thinking is the universal in itself, and therefore a knowledge which has Being in it and
therein all reality, these laws are absolute concepts, and are inseparably the essenti-
alities both of form and of things. Since the universality that moves itself within itself
is the divided simple concept, in this way the concept has content in itself, and the sort
of content that is all content, only not a sensory Being. It is a content which is neither
in contradiction with the form nor separated at all from it, but rather essentially the
form itself; for the form is nothing other than the universal separating itself into its
pure moments.1
    ¶300. But in the way in which this form or content is for observation as observa-
tion, it acquires the determination of a content found, given, i.e. a content that merely
is. It becomes a        quiescent Being       of relations, a multitude of detached necessities
which, as a fixed content in and for themselves, in their determinacy, are supposed to
have truth, and thus are, in fact, withdrawn from the form.—This absolute truth of
fixed determinacies or of many diverse laws contradicts, however, the unity of self-
consciousness, or the unity of thinking and form in general. What is asserted to be a
---
      . (.) 

fixed law that is in itself constant can only be a moment of the unity that reflects itself
into itself, can only emerge as a vanishing magnitude. But torn out of this context of
movement by the consideration of them, and set up singly, the content is not missing
from them, for they have a determinate content, but rather they lack the form which
is their essence. In fact, these laws are not the truth of thinking, not because they are
supposed to be merely formal and to have no content, but rather for the opposite
reason, because they are supposed in their determinacy, or just as a content                              from
which the form has been removed, to rank as something absolute. In their truth, as
vanishing moments in the unity of thinking, they would have to be taken as a
knowledge,1 or as a thinking movement, but not as laws of knowledge. But observing
is not knowledge itself, and is not acquainted with it; it converts its own nature into
the shape of Being, i.e. it grasps its negativity only as laws of Being.—It is sufficient
here to have pointed out the invalidity of the so-called laws-of-thinking from the
general nature of the case. The more precise development belongs to speculative
philosophy in which they show themselves as what they are in truth, viz. singular
vanishing moments whose truth is only the whole of the thinking movement, which
is knowledge itself.2
    ¶301. This negative unity of thinking is for itself, or rather it is Being-for-its-own-self,
the principle of individuality, and in its reality is active consciousness. Consequently, the
observing consciousness is, by the nature of the Thing, led towards this consciousness
as the reality of those laws. Since this connection is not for the observing consciousness,
it thus supposes that thinking, in its laws, remains over on one side for it, and that, on
the other side, it obtains another Being in what is now an object for it, viz. the active
consciousness, which is for itself in such a way that it sublates otherness and has its
actuality in this intuition of itself as the negative.1
    ¶302. A     new    field thus opens up for          observation     in the   acting actuality of con-
sciousness. Psychology contains the multitude of laws in accordance with which the
spirit variously responds to the various modes of its actuality as an otherness it finds
before it; on the one hand, spirit receives these modes into itself, and                              becomes
conformable       to the habits, customs, and way of thinking it encounters, as that in
which it is an object to itself as actuality,—on the other hand, spirit knows itself as
spontaneously active in the face of them, it picks out from them, with inclination and
passion, something only particular for itself, and makes what is objective conform to
itself; in the first case it behaves negatively towards itself as singularity, in the second
case, negatively towards itself as universal Being.—According to the                                first side,
independence gives to what is encountered only the form of self-conscious individu-
ality in general and, as regards the content, remains within the encountered universal
actuality; but according to the other side, independence gives this actuality at least
a peculiar modification which does not contradict its essential content, or even a
modification of the sort whereby the individual, as particular actuality and peculiar
content, sets itself in opposition to the universal actuality, an opposition which
becomes crime when the individual sublates that actuality in a merely singular
manner, or when it does this in a universal way and thus for all, putting another
world, another right, law, and customs in place of the ones present.1
    ¶303. Observational psychology, which at                   first recounts its perceptions of the
universal modes        which it encounters in the active consciousness,                    finds all sorts of
---
                                                .                                

faculties, inclinations, and passions, and since, in the enumeration of this collection,
the memory of the unity of self-consciousness defies repression, psychology must at
least go so far as to be astonished that such a contingent medley of heterogeneous
things can be together in the spirit, as in a bag, particularly too since they show
themselves to be not dead, inert things but restless movements.1
    ¶304. Observation, in enumerating these diverse faculties, is on the universal side;
the unity of these manifold capacities is the opposite side to this universality, the
actual    individuality.—However, to apprehend once more in this way the different
actual individualities, and to recount that one man has more inclination for this,
another for that, that one has more understanding than another, all this has some-
thing much less interesting even than enumerating the species of insects, mosses, etc.;
for these give observation the right to take them thus singly and unconceptually,
because they belong essentially to the element of contingent singularization. On the
other hand, to take conscious individuality unspiritually, as a singular phenomenon
that just is, involves the contradiction that its essence is the universal of spirit. But, since
apprehension admits this individuality at the same time into the form of universality, it
finds the law of individuality, and seems now to have a rational purpose and to conduct
a necessary enterprise.1
    ¶305. The moments constituting the content of the law are, on the one hand, the
individuality itself, on the other hand, its universal inorganic nature, viz. the encoun-
tered circumstances, situation, habits, customs, religion, and so on; from these the
determinate individuality is to be comprehended. They comprise the determinate as
well as the universal, and are at the same time something present, which offers itself
for observation and, on the other side, expresses itself in the form of individuality.1
    ¶306. Now the law of this relationship of the two sides would have to contain the
kind of effect and influence exerted on the individuality by these determinate
circumstances. But this individuality consists precisely both in being the universal,
and hence coalescing in a calm, immediate way with the universal                                present, the
customs, habits, etc., and becoming conformed to them; and equally in reacting in
opposition to them and rather inverting them,—as well as in behaving towards
them in its singularity with complete indifference, neither letting them affect it, nor
being active against them. Therefore, what is to have influence on the individuality,
and    what kind      of influence it is to have,—which really mean the same thing,—
depends solely on the individuality itself; to say that                    by this influence       this indi-
viduality has      become this determinate individuality means nothing else than that
the individuality was this already. Circumstances, situation, customs, etc., which on
the one hand are indicated as present, and on the other hand are indicated in this
determinate individuality, express only the indeterminate essence of the individu-
ality, which is not the point at issue. If these circumstances, way of thinking, customs,
in general the state of the world, had not been, then of course the individual would
not have become what he is; for all the elements comprised in this state of the world
are this universal substance.—But to have particularized itself in this way in                             this
individual—and it is such an individual that is to be comprehended—, the state of the
world would have to have particularized itself in and for itself, and to have operated
on an individual in this determinacy which it has given itself; only in this way would
it have made him into this determinate individual that he is. If the exterior has
---
     . (.) 

constituted itself in and for itself in the way that it appears in the individuality, the
latter would be comprehended from the former. We would have a double gallery of
images, one of which would be the reflection of the other; the one the gallery of the
complete determinacy and delimitation of external circumstances, the other the same
gallery translated into the mode in which those circumstances are in the conscious
essence; the former the surface of the sphere, the latter the centre which represents
the surface within itself.1
    ¶307. But the surface of the sphere, the world of the individual, immediately has an
ambiguous significance: it is world and situation as it is in and for itself, and it is the
world of the individual; it is the latter             either   insofar as the individual has merely
coalesced with that world, has let it, just as it is, enter into him, and behaved towards
it only as formal consciousness,—or, on the other hand, it is the world of the
individual, insofar as what is present has been                   inverted    by the individual.—Since,
on account of this freedom, actuality is capable of this twofold significance, the world
of the individual is to be comprehended only from the individual himself; and the
influence on the individual of actuality, which is represented as being in and for itself,
receives through the individual the absolutely opposite sense, that the individual
either lets the stream of inflowing actuality have its way in him, or else breaks it off
and inverts it. The result of this, however, is that psychological necessity becomes such
an empty phrase that there is present the absolute possibility that what is supposed
to have had this influence could just as well not have had it. 1
    ¶308. Herewith the          Being falls away, which would be               in and for itself     and was
supposed to constitute one side, and the universal side at that, of a law. The
individuality is what its world is, the world that is its own; individuality is itself the
circle of its doing, in which it has presented itself as actuality, and as purely and
simply the unity of Being present and Being made; a unity whose sides do not fall
apart, as in the representation of psychological law, as a world present in itself and an
individuality being for itself; or, if those sides are thus considered each for itself, then
there is no necessity and no law of their reciprocal relation.1

¶309. Psychological observation finds no law of the relationship of self-consciousness
to actuality, or to the world opposed to it; and, through the mutual indifference of
both, it is forced to fall back on the peculiar determinacy of real individuality which is
in and for itself, or contains the opposition of Being-for-itself                       and Being-in-itself
effaced in its absolute mediation. Individuality has now become the object for
observation, or the object to which observation turns.1
    ¶310. The individual is in and for itself; it is for itself or is a free doing; but it is also
in itself; or it has itself an         original    determinate      Being,—a determinacy which in
accordance with the concept is the same as what psychology wanted to find outside
the individual. So the opposition emerges within the individual itself, this duality of
being the movement of consciousness, and the fixed Being of an appearing actuality,
an actuality of a sort that in the individual is immediately its own. This Being, the body
of the determinate individuality, is individuality’s originality, its not-having-done.
---
                                                 .                                

But since the individual is at the same time only what it has done, its body is also the
expression of itself which it has produced; at the same time a                        sign, which has not
remained an immediate Thing, but a sign in which the individual only makes known
what it is, in the sense that it sets its original nature to work.1
    ¶311. If we consider the moments present here in relation to the previous view,
then we have here a universal human shape, or at least the universal shape of a
climate, a part of the world, a people, just as previously we had the same universal
customs and culture. In addition to this, there are the particular circumstances and
situation within the universal actuality; here this particular actuality is as a particular
formation of the shape of the individual.—On the other side, just as previously the
free doing of the individual and actuality as its own had been posited in the face of the
actuality present, here the shape stands as expression of its actualization posited by
the individual itself, the traits and forms of its spontaneously active essence. But the
actuality, universal as well as particular, which observation previously found outside
the individual, is here the actuality            of the individual, its congenital body, and it is
precisely in this that the expression belonging to its doing falls. In the psychological
account, the actuality that is in and for itself and the determinate individuality were
supposed to be related to one another; here, however, the whole determinate                               indi-
viduality is the object of observation; and each side of the opposition is itself this
whole. To the outer whole, therefore, belongs not only the                             original Being, the
congenital body, but equally the formation of the body belonging to the activity of
the inner; the body is the unity of the unformed Being and the formed Being, and is
the individual’s actuality permeated by Being-for-itself. This whole, which embraces
within it the determinate original fixed parts and the traits arising solely from the
doing, is, and this Being is the           expression of the inner, of the individual posited as
consciousness and movement.—This inner, too, is no longer a formal, spontaneous
activity, devoid of content or indeterminate, an activity whose content and deter-
minacy would reside, as before, in external circumstances, but it is an original
character, determined in itself, whose form is merely the activity. It is the relationship
between these two sides that is therefore under consideration here, how it is to be
determined, and what is to be understood by this expression of the inner in the outer. 1
    ¶312. This outer, in the first place, makes the inner visible only as an organ, or, in
general, makes it into a Being for another; for the inner, insofar as it is in the organ, is
the activity    itself. The speaking mouth, the working hand, and the legs too, if you
want to add them, are the actualizing and accomplishing organs, which have within
them the doing        as doing, or the inner as such; but the externality which the inner
gains through them is the deed as an actuality separated from the individual. Speech
and labour are externalizations in which the individual no longer keeps and possesses
himself within himself, but lets the inner go completely outside him, and surrenders
it to something else. For this reason we can just as well say that these externalizations
express the inner too much, as that they do so too little; too much,—because the inner
itself breaks out in them, there remains no opposition between them and it; they give
not merely an expression           of the inner, but immediately the inner itself;                too little,—
because in speech and action the inner turns itself into something else, thus thereby
surrenders itself to the element of change, which inverts the spoken word and the

themselves as actions of this determinate individual. Not only do the products of the
actions, through this externality stemming from the influence of others, lose the
character of being something constant in face of other individualities; but since, in
their relationship to the inner which they contain, they behave as a separated,
indifferent outer, they can, as inner,               through the individual itself, be something
other than they appear,—either because the individual intentionally makes them for
appearance into something other than they are in truth,—or because the individual is
too clumsy to give itself the outer side it really wanted, and to establish it so firmly
that its work cannot be perverted by others. The doing, then, as a completed work,
has the double and opposed significance of being either the inner individuality and
not its expression, or, as the exterior, an actuality               free  from the inner, an actuality
which is something quite different from the inner.—On account of this ambiguity, we
must look around for the inner as it still is within the individual itself, but in a visible
or external way. In the organ, however, it is only as immediate                        doing itself, which
attains its externalization in the deed, which either does, or again does not, represent
the inner. The organ, regarded in the light of this opposition, does not therefore
provide the expression which is sought.1
    ¶313. Now if the outer shape could express the inner individuality only insofar as
that shape is not an organ or not a doing, hence insofar as it is a whole at rest, then it
would behave as a subsistent thing, which calmly received the inner as something
alien into its passive Being-there, and would thereby became the sign of it;—an
external contingent expression whose                actual side lacked any meaning for itself,—a
language whose sounds and sound-combinations are not the Thing itself, but are
linked with it by free wilfulness and are contingent for the Thing.1
    ¶314. Such an arbitrary combination of elements that are something external for
one another yields no law. Physiognomy, however, is supposed to differentiate itself
from other bad arts and unwholesome studies by the fact that it considers the
determinate individuality in the             necessary    opposition of an inner and an outer, of
the character as a conscious essence and this same character as a shape that just is,
and it relates these moments to each other as they are related to each other by their
concept, and must therefore constitute the content of a law. In astrology, palmistry,
and sciences of this sort, on the other hand, what seems to be related is only an outer
to an outer, something or other to something alien to it. This constellation at birth
and, when this external element is brought closer to the body itself, these lines on the
hand, are     external    moments for long or short life, and the fate in general of the
singular man. As externalities, their relationship is one of indifference towards each
other, and they lack the necessity for one another that ought to lie in the relation of
an outer to an inner.1
    ¶315. Admittedly the hand does not seem to be such a very external factor for fate;
it seems rather to relate to it as something inner. For fate in turn is also only the
appearance of what the determinate individuality is                      in itself   as an inner original
determinacy.—Now, to what this determinacy is in itself, the palmist, like the
physiognomist, takes a shorter cut than, e.g., Solon, who thought he could only
know this from and after the course of the whole life; Solon considered the appear-
ance, while they consider the in-itself. That the hand, however, must present the in-
itself of the individuality in respect of its fate is easy to see from the fact that, next to
---
                                                .                               

the organ of speech, it is the hand most of all by which man comes to appearance and
actualization. It is the animated craftsman of his fortune; we may say of the hand that
it is what the man does, for in the hand, as the active organ of his self-fulfilment, the
man is present as the animating soul, and since he is originally his own fate, his hand
will thus express this in-itself.1
    ¶316. From this determination, that the organ of activity is a Being in him as well
as the doing, or that the inner Being-in-itself is itself present in it and has a Being for
others, another view of the organ emerges than the preceding. Namely, if the organs
in general showed themselves unable to be taken as expressions of the inner, for the
reason that in them the doing is present as doing, while the doing as deed is merely
external, and inner and outer in this way fall apart and are, or can be, alien to each
other, then the organ must, in accordance with the determination considered, be
taken again as also middle term of both, since this very fact that the doing is present
in it constitutes at the same time an               externality    of the doing, and, moreover, an
externality other than the deed; for that externality remains with and in the
individual. Now, this middle term and unity of the inner and outer is in the first
place itself external too; but then this externality is at the same time taken up into
the inner; as      simple    externality it stands over against the dispersed externality,
which either is merely a single work or state contingent for the whole individuality,
or else, as complete externality, is fate split up into a multiplicity of works and states.
Thus the      simple lines of the hand, the             timbre    and    compass     of the    voice   as the
individual determinacy of            language,—this too again, as it acquires through the
hand a     firmer existence than it does through the voice,                  writing, and indeed in its
particularity as handwriting—all this is expression of the inner, so that, as the simple
externality, the expression again stands over against the                       manifold externality         of
action and of fate, stands in relationship to them as an inner.—Thus, if at first the
determinate nature and innate peculiarity of the individual, together with what
these have become through cultivation, are taken as the inner, as the essence of the
action and the fate, then the individual has its appearance and externality at first in
its mouth, hand, voice, handwriting, as well as in the other organs and their
permanent determinacies; and only then does it express itself further on the outside
in its actuality within the world.1
    ¶317. Now, because this middle term determines itself as the externalization,
which is at the same time taken back into the inner, its Being-there is not limited
to the immediate organ of doing; the middle term is rather the movement and form
of the countenance and the figure in general, a movement and form which do not
accomplish anything. These features and their movement are, according to this
concept, the doing held back, remaining in the individual, and in accordance with
the individual’s relation to the actual doing, they constitute its own supervision and
observation of the doing, externalization as reflection on the actual externalization.—
The individual is therefore not dumb regarding and in his external doing, because at
the same time he is there reflected into himself, and he externalizes this reflectedness
into himself; this theoretical doing, or the individual’s speech with himself about his
doing, is also perceptible for others, for this speech is itself an externalization.1
    ¶318. In this inner, which in its externalization remains an inner, the individual’s
Being-reflected out of its actuality is therefore observed; and we have to see what the
---
      . (.) 

situation is with this necessity which is posited in this unity.—This reflectedness is in
the   first place different from the deed itself and therefore can be something other
than the deed, and can be taken for something other; we see in someone’s face
whether he is in earnest           about what he is saying or doing.—Conversely, however,
what is here supposed to be the expression of the inner is at the same time an
expression that just is, and hence itself lapses into the determination of Being, which
is absolutely contingent for the self-conscious essence. It is therefore indeed an
expression, but at the same time also only as a sign, so that, for the content expressed,
the constitution of that by which it is expressed is a matter of complete indifference.
In this appearance, the inner is no doubt a visible invisible, but it is not tied to this
appearance; it can take on another appearance, just as well as another inner can take
on the same appearance.—Lichtenberg therefore rightly says:                            Suppose the physi-
ognomist ever did take the measure of a man, it would only require a gallant resolve
for him to make himself incomprehensible again for thousands of years1 Just as, in the.
previous relationship, the given circumstances were a being from which the indi-
viduality took what it was able to and wanted, either submitting to or perverting that
being, for which reason it did not contain the necessity and the essence of the
individuality;—so here, the apparent immediate Being of the individuality is one
which either expresses its reflectedness out of actuality and its Being-within-itself,
or which is for the individuality merely a sign indifferent to what is signified and
therefore in truth signifies nothing; for the individuality, it is as much its countenance
as its mask which it can lay aside.—The individuality permeates its shape, moves and
speaks in it; but this entire Being-there equally turns into a Being that is indifferent
towards the will and the action; individuality effaces in it the significance it formerly
had, the significance of having in it the individuality’s reflectedness into itself or its
true essence, and instead it places its essence conversely in the will and in the deed.2
    ¶319. The individuality gives up that reflectedness-into-itself which is expressed in
the features, and places its essence in the work. Herein it contradicts the relationship
established by the instinct of reason, which engages in the observation of the self-
conscious individuality, with regard to what its inner and outer are supposed to be.
This point of view leads us to the thought which really lies at the base of the science—
if one wishes to call it that—of physiognomy. The opposition which this observation
encounters has the form of the opposition of the practical and the theoretical, both,
that is, posited within the practical itself,—the opposition of individuality actualizing
itself in acting (acting in its most universal sense), and individuality as it is in this
acting at the same time outside it, reflected into itself, and the acting is its object.
Observation accepts this opposition in the same inverted relationship in which the
opposition determines itself in appearance. As the                     unessential outer       it regards the
deed itself and the work, whether it be that of speech or a more durable actuality,—
but as the      essential inner     it counts the Being-within-itself of the individuality. Of
the two sides that the practical consciousness has in it, the intending and the deed
(the opining about its action and the action itself), observation selects the former side
as the true inner; this true inner is supposed to have its more or less                           unessential
externalization in the deed, but its true externalization in its shape. The latter
externalization is the immediate sensory presence of the individual spirit; the
inwardness which is supposed to be the true inwardness is the peculiarity of the
---
                                                 .                               

intention and the singularity of the Being-for-itself; both together the spirit opined.
What observation has for its objects is thus opined Being-there, and it looks for laws
within such Being-there.1
    ¶320. Immediate opining about the opined presence of the spirit is natural
physiognomy, the hasty judgement about the inner nature and the character of its
shape at the first sight of it. The object of this opinion is of such a kind that its essence
involves its being in truth something other than merely sensory immediate Being.
Indeed, what is present is also just this reflectedness-into-itself out of the sensory
within the sensory, what is the object of observation is visibility as visibility of the
invisible. But just this sensory immediate presence is the actuality of spirit, as it is
only for opinion; and observation, in accordance with this side, busies itself with this
opined Being-there of spirit, with physiognomy, handwriting, sound of voice, etc.—It
relates such Being-there to just such an opined inner. It is not the murderer, the thief,
who is supposed to be recognized, but the                    capacity to be one; the          fixed abstract
determinacy thereby gets lost in the concrete, infinite determinacy of the                               single
individual, which now demands more ingenious depictions than those qualifications
are. Such ingenious depictions certainly say more than the qualification of murderer,
thief, or kind-hearted, unspoiled, and so on, but not nearly enough for their purpose,
which is to express the opined Being or the single individuality; any more than the
depictions of the bodily shape which go further than a flat forehead, a long nose, etc.
For the single shape, like the single self-consciousness, is, as opined Being, inexpress-
ible. The science of the knowledge of human beings, which deals with the human
being presumed by opinion, like the science of physiognomy which deals with his
actuality presumed by opinion, and aims at raising the unconscious judging of
natural physiognomy to a branch of knowledge, is therefore something endless and
bottomless; it can never succeed in saying what it opines because it merely opines and
its content is something merely opined.1
    ¶321. The laws which this science sets out to find are relations between these two
opined sides, and hence can themselves be nothing more than an empty opining.
Also, this knowing presumed by opinion, a knowing which takes it upon itself to deal
with the actuality of spirit, has as its object just the fact that spirit reflects itself into
itself out of its sensory Being-there, and the determinate Being-there is for spirit an
indifferent contingency; consequently this knowing must immediately know, regard-
ing the laws it has discovered, that they do not say anything, that it is really just idle
chatter, or merely the voicing of an opinion of oneself; an expression which contains
the truth of presenting this as one and the same thing,—stating ones own opinion,
and thus providing not the Thing but merely an opinion of oneself. As regards their
content, however, these observations cannot diverge from these: ‘It always rains when
we have our annual fair’, says the shopkeeper; ‘and every time, too’, says the housewife,
‘when I am drying my washing.’1
    ¶322. Lichtenberg, who characterizes physiognomic observation in this way, also
says this: ‘If anyone said: “You certainly act like an honest man, but I see from your
figure that you are forcing yourself and are a rogue at heart”; without a doubt, every
gallant fellow to the end of the world will respond to such address with a box on the
ear.’ This retort is apt, because it refutes the first presupposition of such a science of
opining, viz. that the actuality of man is his face, etc.—The true Being of man is rather
---
      . (.) 

his deed; in the deed the individuality is actual, and it is the deed that sublates what
is  opined    in both its sides. First, what is opined as a quiescent bodily Being; the
individuality, in the action, presents itself rather as the negative essence, which only
is insofar as it sublates Being. Then, too, the deed equally sublates the inexpressibility
of the opinion in respect of the self-conscious individuality, which in the opinion is
an infinitely determined and determinable individuality. In the accomplished deed
this bad infinity is annihilated. The deed is something simply determinate, a univer-
sal, to be captured in an abstraction; it is murder, theft, or a good deed, a brave deed,
and so on, and what it is can be said of it. The deed is this, and its Being is not merely
a sign, but the Thing itself. It is this, and the individual man is what the deed is; in the
simplicity of this Being, the individual man is a universal essence that is for others,
and ceases to be only opined. It is true that, in the deed, he is not posited as spirit; but
when it is a question of his Being as Being, and, on the one hand, the twofold Being,
of the shape and the deed, is at odds with itself, and the shape and the deed are each
supposed to be his actuality, then it is the deed alone that must be affirmed as his
genuine Being,—not his figure, which should express what he opines with regard to
his deeds, or what one opined that he merely could do. Similarly, on the other hand,
when his work        and his inner possibility, capacity, or intention are opposed, it is the
work alone which is to be regarded as his true actuality, even if he deceives himself on
the point, and, turning away from his action into himself, opines to be something
other in this inner than in the                deed. Individuality, which entrusts itself to the
objective element when it becomes the work, does of course thereby risk being
altered and perverted. But what constitutes the character of the deed is just this:
whether the deed is an actual Being that endures, or whether it is merely an opined
work, that passes away in intrinsic futility. The objectivity does not alter the deed
itself; it only shows        what     it is, i.e. whether it       is or whether it       is nothing.—The
dismemberment of this Being into intentions and subtleties of that sort, whereby
the   actual   man, i.e. his deed, is to be explained by returning to an opined Being,
however the individual himself may create for himself particular intentions concern-
ing his actuality, must be consigned to the idleness of opinion; if this idleness wants
to set its sterile wisdom to work, to deny the agent the character of reason, and to
ill-treat him in such as fashion as to declare, instead of the deed, rather the figure and
the features to be his Being, then it has to undergo the above retort, which demon-
strates that the
manipulation.1        figure is not the in-itself but, on the contrary, can be an object of
    ¶323. If we look now at the range of relationships in general, in which the self-
conscious individuality can be observed standing towards its exterior, there will be
one left which has still to be made an object for observation. In psychology it is
the external actuality of things which is supposed to have its conscious counterpart in
the spirit and to make spirit comprehensible. In physiognomy, by contrast, spirit is
supposed to be cognized in its              own   exterior, as in a Being which is language—the
visible invisibility of its essence. There still remains the determination of the side of
actuality according to which the individuality expresses its essence in its immediate
actuality, an actuality fixed and purely being-there.—This last relation is thus distin-
guished from the physiognomic by the fact that the physiognomic relation is the
speaking presence of the individual who, in his acting                     externalization, at the same
---
                                                 .                                

time presents the externalization reflecting itself into itself and contemplating itself,
an externalization which is itself movement, features in repose which are themselves
essentially a mediated Being. In the determination yet to be considered, however, the
exterior is finally a wholly immobile actuality which is not in its own self a talking
sign but, separated from self-conscious movement, presents itself for itself and as a
mere thing.1
    ¶324. In the first place, regarding the relation of the inner to this its outer, it is clear
that this relation must be comprehended as a relationship of causal connection, since
the relation of one Being-in-itself to another Being-in-itself, as a necessary relation, is
such a relationship.1
    ¶325. Now, for spiritual individuality to have an effect on the body it must, as
cause, be itself bodily. The bodily element, however, in which it is as cause, is the
organ, but the organ not of the doing with regard to external actuality, but of the
doing of the self-conscious essence within itself, operating outwards only with regard
to its own body; it is not directly ascertainable what organs these can be. If we were
thinking only of organs in general, the organ for labour in general would be readily at
hand, similarly the organ of the sexual drive, and so on. Organs of that sort, however,
are to be considered as instruments or parts which spirit, as one extreme, possesses as
a middle term in the face of the other extreme, which is the external                           object. Here,
however, an organ is understood in which the self-conscious individual, as an
extreme, preserves itself         for itself   in the face of its own actuality opposed to it, is
not at the same time turned outwards but reflected within its action, and in which the
side of    Being    is not a    Being for another. Certainly, in the physiognomic relation
the organ is also considered as a Being-there reflected into itself and commenting on
the doing; but this Being is an objective Being, and the result of the physiognomic
observation is this, that self-consciousness confronts this actuality of itself as some-
thing indifferent. This indifference vanishes in the fact that this reflectedness into
itself is itself efficacious; this Being-there thereby obtains a necessary relation to it;
but to have an effect on that Being-there the reflectedness must itself have a Being,
though not, strictly speaking, an objective Being, and as such an organ it is supposed
to be indicated.1
    ¶326. Now, in ordinary life, anger, e.g., as such an internal doing, is located in
the liver; Plato even assigns the liver something still higher, something which is even
regarded by some as the highest function of all, viz. prophesying, or the gift of
expressing the holy and eternal in an irrational manner. But the movement which
the individual has in his liver, heart, and so on, cannot be regarded as the movement
of the individual wholly reflected into himself; rather it is in him in such a way that it
is already implanted in his body and has an animal Being-there turning outwards
to externality.1
    ¶327. The      nervous system, on the other hand, is the immediate repose of the
organic in its movement. The nerves themselves, it is true, are again the organs of a
consciousness already immersed in its orientation outward; brain and spinal cord,
however, may be considered as the immediate presence of self-consciousness, a
presence which abides within itself, is not objective and also does not go outwards.
Insofar as the moment of Being which this organ has is a Being for another, a Being-
there, it is dead Being, no longer the presence of self-consciousness. But this
---
     . (.) 

Being-within-itself is, in accordance with its concept, a fluidity, in which the circles
cast into it immediately dissolve, and no difference expresses itself as being. Mean-
while, as spirit itself is not something abstractly-simple, but a system of movements in
which it differentiates itself into moments, but in this very differentiation remains free,
and as spirit articulates its body in general into a variety of functions, and determines
one single part for only one function, so too can the fluid Being of its Being-within-self
be represented to oneself as an articulated Being; and it seems that it must be
represented in this way, because the               Being    of spirit reflected into itself is, in the
brain, itself again only a middle term between spirit’s pure essence and its corporeal
articulation, a middle term which therefore must partake of the nature of both and
thus also have in it again, from the corporeal side, the articulation that simply is.1
   ¶328. The spiritual-organic Being has at the same time the necessary side of
an inert subsistent Being-there; the former, as the extreme of Being-for-itself, must
step back, and have this latter as the other extreme over against it, which is then the
object on which the spiritual-organic Being acts as cause. If now the brain and spinal
cord are that corporeal          Being-for-itself     of spirit, then the skull and the vertebral
column are the other extreme to it, an extreme which is separated off, viz. the fixed,
inert thing.—When, however, anyone thinks of the proper location of spirit’s Being-
there, it is not the back that comes to mind but only the head, and so, in examining a
type of knowledge like the one we are now dealing with, we can be satisfied with this
reason—not such a bad reason in this case—in order to confine this Being-there to
the skull. Should it occur to anyone to think of the back as the location of spirit
insofar as by it, too, knowing and doing are no doubt sometimes partly driven in and
partly driven out, this would be no proof at all that the spinal cord must be taken as
included in the indwelling seat of spirit, and its column as the corresponding Being-
there, because this would prove too much; for one may equally recall that there are
other popular external ways, too, for getting at the activity of spirit in order to
stimulate or inhibit it.1—The vertebral column is, then, ruled out, and rightly so, if
you like; and it is as well constructed             as many another doctrine in philosophy of
nature that the skull alone indeed does not contain the organs of the spirit. For this
was previously excluded from the concept of this relationship, and for this reason the
skull was taken on the side of the Being-there; or, if we are not to be allowed to recall
the concept of the Thing, then certainly experience teaches that we do not murder,
steal, write poetry, etc., with the skull, in the way that we see with the eye as an
organ.—For that reason we must also abstain from the expression                              organ for that
significance of the skull of which we have yet to speak. For although it is commonly
said that reasonable men pay attention not to the word but to the Thing, yet this does
not give us permission to designate a Thing with a word inappropriate to it; for this is
at once ineptitude and deceit, which opines and pretends that it lacks only the right
word, and hides from itself that in fact it misses the Thing, i.e. the concept; if the
concept were on hand, then it would also have its right word.—What is determined
here in the first instance is only this: that just as the brain is the living head, the skull
is the caput mortuum. 2
   ¶329. It is in this dead Being, then, that the spiritual movements and determinate
modes of the brain would have to mount their presentation of external actuality, an
actuality, however, which is still in the individual himself. For the relationship of
---
                                                .                                

those movements and modes to the skull, which as dead Being does not have spirit
dwelling within it, there initially presents itself the external mechanical relationship
established above, so that the organs proper—and these are in the brain—here press
the skull out rounded, there widen or flatten it, or in whatever other way one cares to
present this influence on it. As itself a part of the organism, it must indeed be
credited, like every bone, with a living self-formation so that, considered from this
point of view, it is rather the skull that on its part presses on the brain, and imposes its
outer limitation; and it also has the capacity for this, being the harder. But in that case
the same relationship would still remain in the determination of their reciprocal
activity; for whether the skull is the determinant or the determined, this would
produce no alteration at all in the causal connection, except that the skull would
then be made the immediate organ of self-consciousness because in it, as                                cause,
would be found the side of               Being-for-itself. But since        Being-for-itself, as      organic
vitality, falls in both      in the same way, the causal connection between them in fact
falls away. This development of the two, however, would be connected in the interior,
and would be an organic pre-established harmony, which would leave the two
interrelated sides free in respect of each other, and leave each with its own shape to
which the shape of the other need not correspond; and still more so the shape and the
quality with regard to each other,—as the form of the grape and the taste of the wine
are free with regard to each other.—But since the determination of Being-for-itself
falls on the side of the brain, while the determination of Being-there falls on the side
of the skull, a causal connection between them                    also   has to be posited within the
organic unity; a necessary relation between them as external for one another, i.e. a
relation itself external through which, therefore, the shape of each would be deter-
mined by the other.1
    ¶330. However, as regards the determination in which the organ of self-
consciousness would be an active cause on the opposite side, one can talk in diverse
and various ways; for what is in question is the constitution of a cause which is
considered in regard to its indifferent Being-there, its shape and size, a cause whose
interior and Being-for-itself are to be precisely of a kind which does not concern the
immediate Being-there at all. The organic self-formation of the skull is in the first
place indifferent to mechanical influence, and the relationship of these two relation-
ships is, since the former is a relating-of-itself-to-itself, just this very indeterminate-
ness and limitlessness. Then again, even if the brain were to receive into itself the
differences of spirit as differences that simply are, and were a plurality of internal
organs each occupying a different space, it would be left undetermined whether a
spiritual moment would, according as it was originally stronger or weaker, have to
possess in the first case a more expanded brain-organ and in the latter case a more
contracted brain-organ, or alternatively the other way about. (But it is contradictory
to nature for the brain to be such a plurality of internal organs, for nature gives the
moments of the concept a Being-there of their own, and therefore puts the                                 fluid
simplicity of organic life purely on one side, and its articulation and division, equally
in its differences, on the other side, so that in the way they are to be conceived here,
they display themselves as particular anatomical things.) Similarly with the question
whether the cultural development of the brain would enlarge or diminish the organ,
whether it would make it coarser and thicker or finer. From the fact that it remains
---
     . (.) 

undetermined how the cause is constituted, it is equally left undetermined how the
influence operates on the skull, whether it is an enlarging or a narrowing and
contraction. When this influence is determined, as it were, more                          imposingly     as a
stimulation, it is undetermined whether this takes place by swelling, in the manner of
a cantharidin plaster,1 or by shrivelling, in the manner of vinegar.—All views of this
kind can be supported by plausible grounds, for the organic relation, which inter-
venes just as much, accommodates the one as readily as the other, and is indifferent
to all this understanding.2
   ¶331. However, it is not the job of observing consciousness to seek to determine
this relation. For in any case it is not the brain as an animal part that stands on the
one side, but the brain as the           Being    of the self-conscious       individuality.—The indi-
viduality as a lasting character and self-moving conscious doing is                          for itself   and
within itself; confronting this Being-for-itself and Being-within-itself stands its
actuality and Being-there for another; the Being-for- and within-itself is the essence
and subject which has a Being in the brain; this Being is subsumed under the subject,
and gets its value only through the indwelling meaning.1 But the other side of self-
conscious individuality, the side of its Being-there, is                   Being    as independent and
subject, or as a thing, viz. a bone: the actuality and Being-there of man is his skull-
bone.—This is the relationship and the understanding that the two sides of this
relation have in the consciousness observing them.2
   ¶332. Observation has now to deal with the more determinate relation of these
sides; the skull-bone does have in general the meaning of being the immediate
actuality of spirit. But the many-sidedness of spirit gives its Being-there a corres-
ponding variety of meanings; what we have to obtain is the determinacy of the
meaning of the singular places into which this Being-there is divided; and we have to
see how these places contain an indication of that meaning.
   ¶333. The skull-bone is not an organ of activity, nor even a speaking movement;
we neither commit theft, murder, etc. with the skull-bone, nor does it in the least
betray such deeds by a change of countenance, so that the skull-bone would become a
speaking gesture.—Nor has this              being   the value even of a         sign. Countenance and
gesture, tone of voice, even a pillar, a post erected on a desert island, directly proclaim
that something else is meant by them than what they simply are immediately. They at
once profess to be signs, since they have in them a determinacy which points to
something else, by the fact that it does not properly belong to them. One may well
also entertain a variety of thoughts in connection with a skull, like Hamlet over
Yorick’s skull; 1    but the skull-bone for itself is such an indifferent, unencumbered
thing that nothing else is immediately to be seen in it, or to be opined, than simply
the bone itself; it does indeed remind us of the brain and its determinacy, and of
skulls of a different formation, but not of a conscious movement, since there is
impressed on it neither a look nor a gesture, nor anything that proclaims itself to
come from a conscious doing; for it is an actuality whose role it is to present another
sort of side of the individuality, one that would no longer be Being reflecting itself
into itself, but purely immediate Being.2
   ¶334. Further, while the skull-bone does not itself feel, it seems that perhaps a
more determinate significance could still be found for it in the fact that determinate
sensations, by their proximity, might enable us to ascertain what it is meant by it; and
---
                                               .                               

when a conscious mode of spirit has its feeling in a determinate area of the skull,
that place will perhaps indicate, in its shape, that mode and its particularity. Just as,
e.g., some people complain of feeling a painful tension somewhere in the head
when they are thinking hard, or even when thinking                      at all, so too could       stealing,
committing murder, writing poetry, etc., each be accompanied by its own sensation,
which would have to have its particular place besides. This area of the brain, which
would in this way be more moved and activated, would probably also develop the
adjacent area of the bone more; or this area would, from sympathy or consensus,
not be inert, but would enlarge or diminish itself or modify its shape in some way
or other.—What, however, makes this hypothesis improbable is this, that feeling in
general is something indeterminate, and the feeling in the head as the centre might
be the universal accompanying feeling of all suffering, so that mixed up with the
thief ’s–murderer’s–poet’s head-itching or headache are other feelings which could
as little be distinguished from one another and also from those we can call merely
bodily feelings, as an illness can be determined from the symptom of headache, if
we limit its significance merely to the bodily.
   ¶335. In fact, from whatever side we look at the Thing, any necessary reciprocal
relation falls away, as does any indication of it speaking by itself. If, all the same, the
relation is still to obtain, what is left and necessary is an                 unconceptual, free, pre-
established harmony of the corresponding determination of the two sides; for one
of the two sides is to be non-spiritual actuality, a mere thing.—On the one side, then,
there stands a multitude of inert skull-areas, on the other a multitude of spirit-
properties, whose multiplicity and determination will depend on the state of psych-
ology. The more impoverished the representation of spirit, the easier the Thing
becomes from this side; for partly, the properties become all the fewer, and partly,
all the more detached, rigid, and ossified, and therefore all the more akin to bone-
determinations, and more comparable with them. But, although much is made much
easier by the impoverished representation of spirit, yet there still remains a very
great multitude on both sides; there remains for observation the entire contingency
of their relation. If the children of Israel, who are said to correspond to the sands of
the sea-shore,1      should each take unto himself the grain of sand whose sign he is,
this indifference and wilfulness, assigning to each his own grain, would be no more
glaring than that which allots to every capacity of soul, to every passion, and—what
must equally be considered here—to each nuance of character which the more
refined psychology and knowledge of human nature likes to talk about, its particular
skull-area and bone-form.—The skull of a murderer has—not this organ or even
sign—but this bump; but this murderer still has a multitude of other properties, as
well as other bumps, and along with the bumps also hollows; one has a choice among
bumps and hollows. And again, his murderous disposition can be related to any
bump or hollow, and this in turn to any property; for the murderer is neither merely
this abstraction of a murderer, nor does he have only one elevation and one hollow.
The observations undertaken on this point must, for that reason, sound just as good
as the rain of the shopkeeper and of the housewife at the annual fair and on wash-
day. Shopkeeper and housewife were also in a position to make the observation that
it always rains when this neighbour goes by, or when they eat roast pork. Just as rain
is indifferent to circumstances like these, so too, for observation, this determinacy of
---
     . (.) 

spirit is indifferent to this determinate Being of the skull. For of the two objects of this
observation, one is an arid Being-for-itself, an ossified property of spirit, while the
other is an arid        Being-in-itself; such an ossified thing as both are is completely
indifferent to everything else; it is just as indifferent to the high bump whether a
murderer is in its vicinity, as it is to the murderer whether flatness is close by him.2
   ¶336. There remains of course the indisputable possibility                       that a bump at some
place or other is connected with some property, passion, etc. One can in imagination
represent the murderer with a high bump here at this place on the skull, and the thief
with one there. From this side phrenology is still capable of great expansion; for
initially it seems to confine itself to connecting a bump with a property in the same
individual, such that the individual possesses both. But natural phrenology—for there
must be such a science as well as a natural physiognomy,—already goes beyond this
limitation; it not only judges that a cunning man has a bump as big as your                                  fist
behind his ears, but also represents that, not the unfaithful wife herself, but the other
conjugal individual, has bumps on the forehead.—Similarly, one can also represent in
imagination the man who is living under the same roof as the murderer, or even his
neighbour, or, further afield, his fellow-citizens, etc. with high bumps on some part or
other of the skull, as well as the flying cow, that first was caressed by the crab, that was
riding on the donkey, and afterwards, and so on.—But if possibility is taken, not in the
sense of the possibility of representing, but in the sense of                    inner   possibility, or the
possibility of the concept, then the object is an actuality of the kind which is a pure
thing, and is, and should be, without a significance of this sort, and can therefore have
it only in representation.1
   ¶337. If the observer, despite the indifference of the two sides, nevertheless sets to
work to determine relations, partly invigorated by the universal rational ground that
the outer is the expression of the inner, and partly relying on the analogy of the skulls
of animals—which indeed may well have a simpler character than human beings, but
of which at the same time it will be all the harder to say what character they do have,
since it cannot be so easy for anyone really to penetrate in imaginative representation
into the nature of an animal,—then the observer finds, in the affirmation of the laws
that he claims to have discovered, an                  excellent aid     in a distinction which must
necessarily occur to us here too.—The                 Being    of spirit cannot at least be taken as
something simply fixed and immovable. Man is free; it is admitted that the original
Being consists merely of           dispositions, over which he has much power, or which
require favourable circumstances for their development; i.e. an                          original    Being of
spirit is equally well to be spoken of as a Being of the sort that does not exist as Being.
Were observations therefore to contradict what it occurs to someone to affirm as a
law,—should it happen to be fine weather at the annual fair or on wash-day, then
shopkeeper and housewife could say that really it ought to rain, and that the disposition
to rain is nevertheless present; so too with skull-observing,—that this individual really
ought   to be as, according to the law, his skull proclaims, and he has an                            original
disposition, but     one that has not been developed: this quality is not present, but it
ought to be present.—The law and the ought are based on observation of actual rainfall,
and of the actual sense in the case of this determinacy of the skull; but if the actuality
is not present, the       empty possibility       serves equally well.—This possibility, i.e. non-
actuality, of the proposed law, and hence observations contradicting the law, inevitably
---

result from the fact that the freedom of the individual, and the developing circum-
stances, are indifferent to Being in general, indifferent to it both as original inner Being
and as outer bony Being, and also from the fact that the individual can be something
else than he is originally and internally, and still more than what he is as a bone.1
    ¶338. We obtain then the possibility that this bump or hollow on the skull may
signify something actual, or it may only signify a                   disposition, and, indeed, indeter-
minately a disposition to something, that it may signify something non-actual; we see
what happens, as always, to a bad subterfuge, viz. that it is itself ready to be used
against what it is supposed to support. We see opining led by the nature of the Thing
to say the contrary, but thoughtlessly, of what it cherishes;—to say that by this bone
something is indicated, but equally also not indicated.
    ¶339. What opinion has in mind with this subterfuge is the true thought which just
demolishes the opinion, that Being                as such is not the truth of spirit at all. As the
disposition is already an original Being, which has no share in the activity of spirit,
just such a Being is the bone for its part too. A being without any spiritual activity is,
for consciousness, a thing, and, far from being the essence of consciousness, is rather
its contrary, and consciousness is only                 actual    to itself through the negation and
abolition of such a Being.—From this angle it must be regarded as a complete denial
of reason to pass off a bone as the actual Being-there of consciousness; and it is passed
off as this when it is regarded as the exterior of spirit, for the exterior is just the
actuality that is. It is no use saying that from this exterior we only infer the interior,
which is something different, that the outer is not the inner itself, but only its
expression. For in the relationship of the two to one another the determination of
the   actuality thinking itself, and         thought of, does fall on the side of the inner, but
on the side of the outer falls the determination of                    the actuality which         is.—When,
therefore, a man is told: You (your interior) are this, because your bone is constituted
in such and such a way, this means nothing else than: I regard a bone as                                   your
actuality. To reply to such a judgement with a box on the ear, like the above-
mentioned reply in the case of physiognomy, initially dislodges the soft parts from
their aspect and position, and proves only that these are no true                           in-itself, not the
actuality of spirit; the retort here would, strictly speaking, have to go the length of
beating in the skull of anyone making such a judgement, in order to demonstrate in a
manner just as palpable as his wisdom, that for a man, a bone is nothing in itself,
much less his true actuality. 1
    ¶340. The crude instinct of self-conscious reason will reject out of hand such a
science of skulls,—this other observing instinct of self-conscious reason which, having
attained to a glimpse of cognition, has grasped it in an unspiritual way, according to
which the outer is the expression of the inner. But the worse the thought, the less
sometimes does it strike one wherein its badness determinately lies, and the harder it is
to analyse it. For the thought is said to be worse, the purer and emptier the abstraction
which it takes to be the essence. But the opposition we are here concerned with has for
its terms the individuality conscious of itself, and the abstraction of the externality that
has become wholly a thing—that inner Being of spirit conceived as fixed unspiritual
Being, opposed to just such a Being.—But with this, observing reason also seems in
fact to have reached its peak, at which point it must abandon itself and do an about-
turn; for only what is wholly bad has in itself the immediate necessity of reversing
---
     . (.) 

itself.—Just as it can be said of the Jewish people that it is precisely because they stand
before the portal of salvation that they are, and have been, the most rejected of peoples:
what this people should be in and for itself, this self-essentiality, it is not in its own
eyes, but it displaces it beyond itself; by this estrangement it opens up to itself the
possibility of a higher Being-there, if it could take back its object again into itself, than
if it had remained within the immediacy of Being; because spirit is all the greater, the
greater the opposition from which it returns into itself; but it makes itself this
opposition in the sublation of its immediate unity and in the estrangement of its
Being-for-itself. However, if such a consciousness does not reflect itself, the midpoint,
in which it stands, is an unhappy void, since what should fulfil it has become a fixed
extreme. Thus this final stage of observing reason is its worst, but because of that its
reversal is necessary.1
   ¶341. For a survey of the series of relationships considered so far which constitute
the content and object of observation shows that in their first mode, in the observa-
tion of the relationships of inorganic nature, sensory Being already disappears for it;
the moments of its relationship present themselves as pure abstractions and as simple
concepts which should be              firmly tied to the Being-there of things, a Being-there,
however, which gets lost, so that the moment proves to be a pure movement and a
universal. This free process, complete within itself, retains the significance of some-
thing objective, but now emerges as a unit; in the process of the inorganic, the unit is
the non-existent inner; but existing as a unit, the process is the organic.—The unit, as
Being-for-itself or negative essence, confronts the universal, draws away from it, and
remains free for itself, so that the concept, realized only in the element of absolute
singularization, does not find in organic existence its genuine expression, to be there
as  a universal, but remains an exterior, or what is the same thing, an                             interior   of
organic nature.—The organic process is only free in itself, but is not free for itself; in
the   purpose    the Being-for-itself of its freedom makes its entry,                      exists  as another
essence, as a wisdom conscious of itself that is outside the process. Observing reason
thus turns to this wisdom, turns to spirit, to the concept existing as universality, or to
purpose existing as purpose; and henceforth the object before it is its own essence.1
   ¶342. Reason turns at first to the purity of the object; but since it is the apprehen-
sion of the object, which moves in its differences as a being, laws of thinking emerge
for it, relations of constant to constant; but since their content is only moments, these
laws go astray into the unit of self-consciousness.—This new object, similarly taken as
a  being, is the     single,   contingent      self-consciousness; observation stands, therefore,
within the opined spirit and the contingent relationship of conscious actuality to
unconscious actuality. This object alone is in itself the necessity of this relation;
observation therefore gets to grips with it more closely, and compares its willing and
doing actuality with its actuality reflected into itself and contemplating, an actuality
that is itself objective. This exterior, although a language of the individual which he
has within himself, is at the same time, as sign, something indifferent to the content it
is supposed to signify, just as that which posits for itself the sign is indifferent to it.1
   ¶343. Because of this, observation                finally goes back again from this inconstant
language to fixed Being, and declares, in accordance with its concept, that externality
is the outer and immediate actuality of spirit, not as an organ, and not as language or
sign, but as a dead thing. What was sublated by the very first observation of inorganic
---
                                                                                               .                                                                               

nature, viz. that the concept ought to be present as a thing, is reinstated by this
last mode in such a way that it makes the actuality of spirit itself into a thing or,
expressing it the other way round, gives to dead Being the significance of spirit.—With
this, observation has here reached the point where it declares what our concept of it
was, viz. that the certainty of reason seeks its own self as objective actuality.—Of
course, one does not mean here that spirit, which is represented by a skull, is
expressed as a thing; there is not supposed to be any materialism, as it is called,
involved in this thought, but rather spirit is supposed still to be something other than
this bone; but spirit is, itself signifies nothing else than: it is a thing. When Being as
such, or thingly Being, is predicated of spirit, then for that reason the genuine
expression of this is that spirit is the same kind of thing as a bone. It must therefore
be regarded as extremely important that the true expression has been found for the
fact that it is purely said of spirit: it is. If it is customarily said of spirit: it is, it has a
Being, is a thing, a singular actuality, then what is meant by this is not something we
can see or take in our hands or touch, and so on, but something like that is what is
said; and what in truth is said expresses itself as: the Being of spirit is a bone. 1
      ¶344. Now this result has a twofold significance. One is its true significance, insofar
as it is a completion of the result of the preceding movement of self-consciousness. The
unhappy self-consciousness estranged its independence, and struggled to make its
Being-for-itself into a thing. It thereby reverted from self-consciousness to conscious-
ness, i.e. to the consciousness for which the object is a                                                                                              Being, a                thing;—but here,
what is a thing is self-consciousness; the thing is, therefore, the unity of the I and
Being, the category. Since the object is determined thus for consciousness, conscious-
ness has reason. Consciousness, as well as self-consciousness,                                                                                                             is in itself          strictly
reason; but only that consciousness for which the object has determined itself as
the category can be said to have reason; from this, however, we must still distinguish
the knowledge of what reason is.—The category, which is the                                                                                                             immediate unity of
Being and of what is                                     one’s own, must pass through both forms, and it is precisely
to observing consciousness that the category presents itself in the form of                                                                                                                        Being.
This consciousness, in its result, enunciates as a proposition that of which it is the
unconscious certainty—the proposition that is implicit in the concept of reason. This
proposition is the
sublates itself.1—Through this result, then, the category acquires this determinateinfinite judgement that the Self is a thing,—a judgement that
addition, that it is this self-sublating opposition. The                                                                                          pure          category, which is for
consciousness in the form of                                                    Being            or      immediacy, is the still                                       unmediated, merely
present object, and consciousness is an equally unmediated attitude. The moment of
that infinite judgement is the transition of                                                                      immediacy                     into mediation or negativity.
The object present is consequently determined as a negative object, while conscious-
ness is determined as                                       self-consciousness facing it, or the category, which has run
through the form of Being in observation, is now posited in the form of Being-for-
itself: consciousness no longer aims to find itself immediately, but to produce itself by
its own activity. It itself is the purpose of its doing, as in observing it was concerned
only with things.2
      ¶345. The other significance of the result is the significance already considered,
that of unconceptual observation. This knows no other way of grasping and express-
ing itself than naively asserting the actuality of self-consciousness to be the bone just
---
     . (.) 

as it occurs as a sensory thing, which at the same time does not lose its objectivity
for consciousness. It also has no clear consciousness, however, about the fact that it
says this, and does not grasp its proposition in the determinacy of its subject and
predicate, and their relation, still less in the sense of the infinite, self-dissolving
judgement, and of the concept.—Rather, out of a deeper-rooted self-consciousness
of spirit, which here appears as a natural honesty, it conceals from itself the ignominy
of the unconceptual, naked thought which takes a bone for the actuality of self-
consciousness, and whitewashes that thought by the additional thoughtlessness of
mixing in all sorts of relationships of cause and effect, of sign, organ, etc. which have
no sense here, and of hiding the frivolity of the proposition by distinctions derived
from them.
   ¶346. Brain fibres and the like, when regarded as the Being of spirit, are already an
actuality in thought, only hypothetical,—not the true actuality as being-there, not felt
and seen actuality; when they are there, when they are seen, they are dead objects, and
then no longer pass for the Being of spirit. But objectivity proper must be an
immediate, sensory         objectivity, so that in this objectivity as dead—for the bone is
what is dead, insofar as what is dead is present in the living creature itself—spirit is
posited as actual.—The concept of this representation is that reason is to itself                          all
thinghood, even thinghood that is               purely objective itself; but reason is this           in the
concept, or only the concept is the truth of this representation; and the purer the
concept itself is, the sillier the representation to which it degenerates when its content
is not as concept, but as representation,—if the self-sublating judgement is not taken
with the consciousness of this its infinitude, but as a permanent proposition whose
subject and predicate are valid each for itself, the Self fixed as Self, the thing fixed as
thing, and yet one is supposed to be the other.—Reason, essentially the concept, is
immediately divided into itself and its contrary, an opposition that, just because of
this, is equally immediately sublated. But when reason presents itself as its own self
and as its contrary, and is held fast in the entirely singular moment of this asunder-
ness, it is apprehended irrationally; and the purer the moments of this asunderness,
the cruder is the appearance of this content which is either only for consciousness, or
only ingenuously expressed by it.—The                  profundity      which spirit draws forth from
within, but only as far as its representational consciousness where it lets it remain,
and the ignorance of this consciousness about what it is that it is saying, are the same
conjunction of the high and the low which, in the living creature, nature naively
expresses in the conjunction of the organ of its highest fulfilment, the organ of
generation, with the organ of pissing.—The infinite judgement, as infinite, would
be the fulfilment of life apprehending itself; but when the consciousness of this life
remains in representation it behaves like pissing.1
B. The actualization of rational self-consciousness through itself
¶347. Self-consciousness found the thing as itself, and found itself as a thing; i.e. it is
for it that in itself it is objective actuality. It is no longer the immediate certainty of
being all reality; but a certainty for which the immediate in general has the form of a
sublated immediate, so that its objectivity still has only the value of a surface, whose
interior and essence is self-consciousness itself.—The object, to which it is positively
related, is therefore a self-consciousness; the object is in the form of thinghood, i.e. it
---
                                                 .                                

is independent; but self-consciousness has the certainty that this independent object
is for it not anything alien; thus it knows that it is in itself recognized by the object;
it is spirit that has the certainty of having its unity with itself in the duplication of its
self-consciousness and in the independence of both. This certainty has now to be
elevated to truth for self-consciousness; what holds good for it, that it is in itself and
in its inner certainty, has to enter into its consciousness and become for it. 1
    ¶348. What the universal stations of this actualization will be is already signified
in a general way from a comparison with the path followed so far. That is, just as
observing reason repeated, in the element of the category, the movement of                                 con-
sciousness, viz. sense-certainty, perceiving, and understanding, so reason will again
run through the double movement of                    self-consciousness       too, and pass over from
independence into its freedom. To begin with, this active reason is conscious of itself
merely as an individual and as such must demand and produce its actuality in the
other,—but then, when its consciousness ascends to universality, the individual
becomes universal reason, and is conscious of itself as reason, as something already
recognized       in and for itself,        which in its pure consciousness unites all self-
consciousness; it is the simple spiritual essence which, in attaining at the same time
to consciousness, is the          real substance, into which the earlier forms return as into
their ground, so that, with regard to the ground, they are merely single moments of
its becoming, moments which do indeed break loose and appear as determinate
shapes, but in fact have          Being-there and actuality         only as sustained by the ground,
and have their truth only insofar as they are in it and remain in it. 1
    ¶349. If we take in its reality this goal, which is the concept that has already arisen
for us,—viz. the recognized self-consciousness that has the certainty of itself in the
other free self-consciousness, and has its truth precisely in it,—or if we bring out this
still inner spirit as the substance that has already advanced to its Being-there, then in
this concept the realm of ethical life opens up. For this is nothing else than, in the
independent actuality of individuals, the absolute spiritual unity of their essence; it
is a self-consciousness, universal in itself, that takes itself to be actual in another
consciousness, in such a way that this other consciousness has complete independ-
ence or is a thing for it, and that it is precisely therein that the universal self-
consciousness is aware of its unity with the other, and only in this unity with this
objective essence is it self-consciousness. This ethical substance, the                       abstraction of
universality, is only the law           in thought, but it is just as immediately actual                   self-
consciousness, or it is        custom. The       singular consciousness, conversely, is only this
unitary being insofar as it is conscious of the universal consciousness in its singularity
as its own Being, insofar as its doing and Being-there is the universal custom.1
    ¶350. It is in the life of a people in fact that the concept of the actualization of self-
conscious reason has its complete reality—intuiting, in the independence of the other,
complete unity with it, or having for my object, as                      my   Being-for-myself, the free
thinghood of an Other I encounter, a thinghood that is the negative of myself. Reason
is present as the fluid universal substance, as unchangeable simple thinghood, which
bursts     asunder       into    many      completely       independent        essences,      just   as    light
bursts asunder into stars as countless points shining for themselves, which in their
absolute Being-for-themselves are dissolved in the simple independent substance, not
merely in themselves, but           for themselves; they are conscious of being these singular
---
     . (.) 

independent essences because of the fact that they sacrifice their singularity, and this
universal substance is their soul and essence; just as this universal is again the doing
of themselves as singular, or is the work that they have produced. 1
    ¶351. The     purely singular       doings and activities of the individual relate to the
needs which he has as a natural creature, i.e. as a singularity that just is. That even
these, its commonest functions, do not come to nothing, but have actuality, come
about through the universal sustaining medium, through the                           power of the entire
people.—But it is not only this form of the subsistence of his doing in general that
the individual has in the universal substance, but equally its content; what he does
is  the universal skill and custom of all. This content, insofar as it is completely
singularized, is, in its actuality, confined within the framework of the doing of all.
The labour of the individual for his needs is just as much a satisfaction of the needs
of others as of his own, and the satisfaction of his own needs he obtains only
through the labour of others.—As the singleton in his                          singular    labour already
unconsciously accomplishes a universal labour, so again he also accomplishes the
universal labour as his conscious object; the whole becomes, as a whole, his product,
for which he sacrifices himself and precisely in so doing receives back from it his
own self.—There is nothing here which would not be reciprocal, nothing in which
the independence of the individual would not, in the dissolution of its Being-for-
itself in the    negation of itself, give itself its positive significance of being for itself.
This unity of Being for another or of making oneself a thing, and of Being-for-
itself, this universal substance, speaks its              universal language        in the customs and
laws of its people. But this unchangeable essence that just is, is nothing but the
expression of the singular individuality itself which seems opposed to it; the laws
proclaim what each singleton is             and does; the individual recognizes them not only
as his   universal     objective thinghood, but equally recognizes himself in them, or
recognizes them as singularized in his own individuality and in each of his fellow
citizens. In the universal spirit, therefore, each has only the certainty of himself, of
finding nothing but himself in the actuality that is; he is as certain of the others as
he is of himself.—I intuit in all of them that they are for themselves only these
independent essences, just as I am; I intuit in them the free unity with the others in
such a way that, just as this unity is through me, so it is through the others
themselves,—I intuit them as me, me as them. 1
    ¶352. In a free people, therefore, reason is in truth actualized; it is a present living
spirit in which the individual not only finds his determination, i.e. his universal and
singular essence, expressed and present as thinghood, but is himself this essence and
has also attained his determination. The wisest men of antiquity have therefore made
the announcement: that wisdom and virtue consist in living in conformity with the
customs of one’s people.1
    ¶353. But from this happy condition of having reached its determination and
of living in it, self-consciousness, which initially is spirit only immediately and                        in
accordance with the concept, has withdrawn, or else—has not yet reached it; for both
may equally well be said.1
    ¶354. Reason must withdraw from this happy condition; for the life of a free people
is only in itself, or immediately, the real ethical order, or it is an ethical order that is,
and therefore this universal spirit itself is also a singular spirit, the whole of the
---
                                                 .                                

customs and laws are a             determinate      ethical substance, which only in the higher
moment, viz. in the          consciousness of its essence, sheds this limitation and in this
cognition alone has its absolute truth, but not immediately in its Being; in its Being it
is a limited ethical substance, and absolute limitation is just this, that spirit is in the
form of Being. 1
   ¶355. Further, the single consciousness, as it immediately has its existence in the
real ethical order or in the people, is therefore a solid trust, for which spirit has not
resolved itself into its abstract moments, and which therefore is not aware of itself as
being pure singularity for itself. But once it has arrived at this thought, as it must, then
this immediate unity with spirit, or its Being in spirit, its trust, is lost;                     isolated for
itself, the single consciousness is now the essence to itself, no longer universal spirit.
The moment of this singularity of self-consciousness                    is, of course, within universal
spirit itself, but only as a vanishing quantity which, as soon as it emerges for itself, just
as immediately dissolves in universal spirit, and enters consciousness only as trust. In
thus establishing itself—and each moment, because it is a moment of the essence,
must succeed in displaying itself as the essence—the individual has thereby placed
himself in opposition to the laws and customs; they are only a thought without
absolute essentiality, an abstract theory without actuality; but the individual as this
I is to itself the living truth.1
   ¶356. Or, self-consciousness has              not yet attained this happy condition                of being
ethical substance, the spirit of a people. For having returned back from observation,
spirit, at first, is not yet actualized as such through itself; it is posited only as inner
essence or as abstraction.—Or, spirit is, at first, immediately; but in being immedi-
ately, it is singular; it is the practical consciousness, which steps into its world which it
finds before it, with the aim of duplicating itself in this determinacy of a singular, of
engendering itself as a This, as its counterpart that just is, and of becoming conscious
of this unity of its actuality with the objective essence. Consciousness has the
certainty of this unity; it holds that the unity, or that this agreement of itself with
thinghood, is already present             in itself, and has only to become present                    to itself
through its own agency, or that the production of the unity is equally the                              finding
of it. Since this unity means happiness, this individual is herewith sent out into the
world by its spirit to seek its happiness.1
   ¶357. If then, for us, the truth of this rational self-consciousness is the ethical
substance, here, for that self-consciousness, is the beginning of its ethical world-
experience. Insofar as self-consciousness has not yet attained the ethical substance,
this movement presses towards it; and what sublates itself in the ethical substance are
the single moments which for self-consciousness are valid in their isolation. They
have the form of an immediate willing or natural impulse which obtains its satisfac-
tion, a satisfaction which is itself the content of a new impulse.—But insofar as self-
consciousness has lost the happiness of being in the substance, these natural impulses
are bound up with consciousness of their purpose as the true determination and
essentiality; the ethical substance has declined into a selfless predicate, whose living
subjects are the individuals who have to fulfil their universality by their own efforts
and to provide for their determination by themselves.—In the former meaning, then,
those shapes are the becoming of the ethical substance and precede it; in the latter
meaning, they follow it and resolve for self-consciousness what its determination is.
---
     . (.) 

In the former case, the immediacy or rawness of the impulses gets lost in the
movement of experiencing what their truth is, and their content passes over into a
higher content, while in the latter case, what is lost is the false representation of the
consciousness which posits its determination in those impulses. In the former case,
the  goal   they attain is the ethical substance, while, in the latter, the goal is the
consciousness of those impulses,1 and in fact a consciousness of such a sort that it
knows them as its own essence; and to that extent this movement would be the
becoming of morality, of a higher shape than ethical substance. But these shapes, at
the same time, constitute only one side of the becoming of morality, namely, the side
that falls in Being-for-itself, or in which consciousness sublates its purposes,—not the
side where morality emerges from the substance itself. Since these moments cannot
as yet have the significance of being made into purposes in opposition to the lost
ethical order, they count here, in fact, for no more than their bare content, and the
goal they press towards is the ethical substance. But since in our times that form of
these moments is more familiar in which they appear after consciousness has lost its
ethical life and, in searching for it, repeats those forms, they may be represented more
in terms of this sort.2
   ¶358. Self-consciousness which is at first only the concept of spirit, enters on this
path with the determinacy of being, to itself, the essence as a singular spirit; and its
purpose is therefore to give itself actualization as a single self-consciousness and to
enjoy itself as this single self-consciousness in its actualization.
   ¶359. In the determination of being, in its own eyes, the essence as a being-for-
itself, it is the  negativity of the other; in its consciousness, therefore, it itself as the
positive confronts something which certainly                    is, but has for it the significance of
something that is-not-in-itself; consciousness appears split into this actuality found
before it and the purpose which it accomplishes by sublating that actuality, a purpose
that it makes into actuality in place of the former. [a] Its initial purpose, however, is
its immediate abstract Being-for-itself or to intuit itself as this singleton in another, or
to intuit another self-consciousness as itself. [b] The experience of what the truth of
this purpose is raises self-consciousness to a higher level, and from now on it is its
own purpose, insofar as it is at the same time universal and has the law immediately
within it. In carrying out this law of its heart, however, it learns by experience that the
single essence, in doing so, cannot maintain itself, but rather that the good can only
be accomplished through the sacrifice of this essence, and [c] self-consciousness
becomes      virtue. The experience that virtue undergoes can only be this, that its
purpose is already attained in itself, that happiness is found immediately in the
doing itself, and the doing itself is the good. The concept of this entire sphere, that
thinghood is the        Being-for-itself    of spirit itself, dawns on self-consciousness in the
movement of this sphere. Having found this concept, self-consciousness is thus, to
itself, actuality as individuality immediately expressing itself, an individuality which
meets no resistance in an actuality opposed to it, and whose object and purpose is
only this expression itself.1

¶360. Self-consciousness which, to itself, is reality in general, has its object in its own
self, but as an object which it initially has only for itself, and which is not yet in being;

                                                 .                           

Being confronts it as an actuality other than its own; and self-consciousness sets out,
by accomplishing its Being-for-itself, to intuit itself as another independent essence.
This first purpose is to become conscious of itself as singular essence in the other self-
consciousness, or to make this other into itself; it has the certainty that in itself this
other is already itself.—Insofar as it has raised itself out of the ethical substance and
the tranquil Being of thinking to its               Being-for-itself, it has left behind the law of
custom and Being-there, the findings of observation, and theory, as a grey shadow in
the process of disappearing; for this is rather a knowledge of something whose Being-
for-itself and actuality is other than that of self-consciousness. Instead of the heavenly-
seeming spirit of the universality of knowing and doing in which the sensation and
the enjoyment of singularity are silent, there has entered into it the spirit of the Earth,
for which what counts as true actuality is only that Being which is the actuality of the
singular consciousness.

                     It despises intellect and science,
                     The supreme gifts of man—It has surrendered to the devil
                     And must go under.1
¶361. It plunges therefore into life and brings to fulfilment the pure individuality
in which it arises. It does not so much make its own happiness as immediately take
and enjoy it. The shadows of science, laws and principles, which alone stand between
it and its own actuality, vanish like a lifeless mist which can be no match for the
certainty of its reality; it takes hold of life much as a ripe fruit is plucked, which
readily offers itself to the hand that takes it.1
   ¶362. Its doing is only in one moment a doing of desire; it does not aim at the
destruction of the objective essence in its entirety, but only at the form of its
otherness or its independence, which is a semblance devoid of essence; for in itself
it counts this otherness as the same essence as itself, or its selfhood. The element in
which desire and its object subsist, mutually indifferent and independent, is living
Being-there; the enjoyment of desire sublates this Being-there insofar as it belongs to
the object of desire. But here this element which gives to both a separate actuality is
rather the category, a Being which is essentially a represented Being; it is therefore
the consciousness of independence, which preserves the individuals each for itself—
whether it now be natural consciousness, or consciousness developed into a system of
laws. This separation is not in itself for self-consciousness, which knows the other as
its own selfhood. It attains therefore to the enjoyment of pleasure, to the conscious-
ness of its actualization in a consciousness which appears as independent, or to the
intuition of the unity of the two independent self-consciousnesses. It attains its
purpose, but just in doing so it experiences what the truth of that purpose is. It
comprehends itself as          this singular essence that is-for-itself, but the actualization of
this purpose is itself the sublation of it; for it becomes an object to itself not as this single
self-consciousness, but rather as the unity               of itself and the other self-consciousness,
hence as a sublated singleton or a universal.1
   ¶363. The pleasure enjoyed has indeed the positive significance of having become
to itself as objective self-consciousness; but equally it has the negative significance of
having sublated        itself; and since it comprehended its actualization in the former
---
      . (.) 

significance only, its experience enters its consciousness as a contradiction in which
the attained actuality of its singularity sees itself destroyed by the negative                        essence,
which confronts it, devoid of actuality and empty, and yet is the power consuming it.
This essence is nothing else than the concept of what this individuality in itself is.
This individuality is, however, as yet the poorest shape of self-actualizing spirit; for
it is, to itself, at first only the abstraction of reason, or the immediacy of the unity of
Being-for-itself     and    Being-in-itself; its essence is, therefore, only the                abstract    cat-
egory. Nevertheless it no longer has the form of immediate, simple Being, as it has
for the observing spirit, where it is abstract Being or, posited as alien, is thinghood in
general. Here in this thinghood there has entered Being-for-itself and mediation.
Thinghood therefore makes its entry as a circle whose content is the developed pure
relation of the simple essentialities. The actualization attained by this individuality
consists therefore in nothing more than this, viz. that it has cast forth this circle of
abstractions from its confinement within simple self-consciousness, into the elem-
ent of    Being-for-it     or of objective expansion. So what becomes an                      object    to self-
consciousness as its essence in the pleasure of enjoyment is the expansion of those
empty essentialities, of pure unity, of pure difference, and their relation; further, the
object which the individuality experiences as its essence, has no content. It is what is
called necessity; for necessity, fate, and the like, is just that about which we cannot
say   what it does, what its determinate laws and positive content are, because it is
the absolute pure concept itself intuited as Being, the                     relation    that is simple and
empty, but also irresistible and imperturbable, whose work is merely the nothing-
ness of singularity. It is this fixed connection, because what is connected is the pure
essentialities or the empty abstractions; unity, difference, and relation are categories
each of which is nothing in and for itself, but only in relation to its contrary, and
they cannot therefore be separated from one another. They are related to one
another through their concept, for they are the pure concepts themselves; and this
absolute relation       and abstract movement constitutes necessity. The merely single
individuality which, in the first instance, has only the pure concept of reason for its
content, instead of having taken the plunge from dead theory into life, has therefore
really only plunged into the consciousness of its own lifelessness and partakes of
itself only as empty and alien necessity, as dead actuality. 1
    ¶364. The transition takes place from the form of the One into that of                              univer-
sality, from one absolute abstraction into the other, from the purpose of pure Being-
for-itself which has thrown off community with others, into the pure contrary which
is thereby equally abstract             Being-in-itself. Consequently, the way in which this
appears is that the individual has simply met its downfall, and the absolute rigidity
of singularity is pulverized on the equally hard but continuous actuality.—Since it
is, as consciousness, the unity of itself and its contrary, this downfall is still for it its
purpose and actualization, as also the contradiction of what was to it                            the essence
and what is       in itself  the essence;—it experiences the double meaning involved in
what it did, viz. when it took hold of its life; it took life but in doing so it really got
hold of death.1
    ¶365. This transition of its living Being into lifeless necessity therefore appears to it
as an inversion which is not mediated by anything at all. The mediator would have to
be that in which both sides would be one, where, therefore, consciousness recognized
---
                                                 .                                

one moment in the other, its purpose and doing in fate, and its fate in its purpose and
doing, its own essence in this necessity. But this unity is, for this consciousness, just
pleasure itself, or the simple single feeling, and the transition from the moment of this
its purpose into the moment of its true essence is for it a sheer leap into the opposite;
for these moments are not contained and linked together in feeling, but only in the
pure Self, which is a universal or thinking. Consciousness, therefore, through its
experience in which it should have found its truth, has really become a riddle to itself,
the consequences of its deeds are, to it, not the deeds themselves; what befalls it is, for
it, not the experience of what it is in itself, the transition is not a mere alteration of the
form of the same content and essence, represented now as content and essence of
consciousness, and again as object or intuited essence of itself. The abstract necessity
therefore counts as the merely negative, uncomprehended power of universality, in
which individuality is smashed to pieces.1
   ¶366. This is as far as the appearance of this shape of self-consciousness goes; the
final moment of its existence is the thought of the loss of itself in necessity, or the
thought of itself as an essence that is absolutely alien to it. However, self-consciousness
has in itself survived this loss; for this necessity or pure universality is its own essence.
This reflection of consciousness into itself, knowing the necessity as
shape of consciousness.1                                                                      itself, is a new
.           -
¶367. What necessity in truth is in self-consciousness, it is for its new shape of self-
consciousness, in which it knows itself as the necessary; it knows that it has the
universal or the law immediately              within itself, and because of its determination of
being immediately present in the Being-for-itself of consciousness, it is called the law
of the heart. Like the previous shape, this shape is for itself, as singularity, essence; but
it is richer in having the determination that its                     Being-for-itself     counts for it as
necessary or universal.
   ¶368. The law, therefore, which is immediately self-consciousness’s own law, or a
heart which nevertheless has a law within it, is the purpose which self-consciousness
proceeds to actualize. It remains to be seen whether its actualization will correspond
to this concept and whether in that actualization it will experience this, its law as
the essence.1
   ¶369. This heart is confronted by an actuality; for in the heart the law is, at first,
only   for itself, it is not yet actualized, and is therefore at the same time something
other than the concept. This other thereby determines itself as an actuality which is
the opposite of what is to be actualized, and consequently is the contradiction of the
law and the singularity. This actuality is, therefore, on the one hand a law by which
the single individuality is oppressed, a violent ordering of the world which contra-
dicts the law of the heart and, on the other hand, a humanity suffering under that
ordering, a humanity that does not follow the law of the heart, but is subjected to an
alien necessity.—It is evident that this actuality which appears                          over against       the
present shape of consciousness is nothing else but the foregoing discordant relation-
ship of individuality and its truth, the relationship of a cruel necessity by which the
former is oppressed. For us, the preceding movement stands over against the new
shape, because the latter in itself has arisen from it, and the moment from which
---
     . (.) 

it has come is therefore necessary for it; but to the new shape that moment appears
as something found before it, since it has no consciousness of its own origin, and to
it the essence is rather to be for its own self, or the negative relatively to this positive
in-itself.1
   ¶370. This individuality therefore directs its energies to sublating this necessity
which contradicts the law of the heart, and also the suffering brought about by it. And
so it is no longer the levity of the previous shape, which only wanted the singular
pleasure; on the contrary, it is the earnestness of a high purpose which seeks its
pleasure in displaying the excellence of its own essence, and in promoting the welfare
of humanity. What it actualizes is itself the law, and its pleasure is therefore at the
same time the universal pleasure of all hearts. To it the two are                            inseparable; its
pleasure is what conforms to the law, and the actualization of the law of universal
humanity procures for it its own singular pleasure. For within its own self, individu-
ality and the necessary are immediately one; the law is the law of the heart. Individu-
ality is not yet dislodged from its seat, and the unity of the two has not been brought
about by their mediating movement, not yet through discipline. The actualization of
the immediate undisciplined essence passes for a display of its excellence and as
promotion of the welfare of humanity.1
   ¶371. The law, on the other hand, which confronts the law of the heart is separated
from the heart, and free for itself. Humanity which is subject to this law does not live
in the blessed unity of the law with the heart; but either lives in cruel separation and
in suffering, or at least dispenses with the enjoyment of itself in compliance with the
law, and lacks the consciousness of its own excellence in transgressing it. Because that
authoritative divine and human order is separated from the heart, it is for the latter a
semblance      which ought to lose what is still associated with it, viz. the power of
authority and actuality. In its content it may well by chance agree with the law of the
heart, and then the latter can accept it; but for the heart, the essence is not the bare
conformity to law as such, but that in the law it has the consciousness of itself, that it
has satisfied itself in it. Where, however, the content of universal necessity does not
agree with the heart then necessity, even as regards its content, is in itself nothing and
must give way to the law of the heart.1
   ¶372. The individual, then, accomplishes the law of his heart; this law becomes a
universal order, and pleasure becomes an actuality which in and for itself conforms to
law. But, in this actualization, the law of the heart has in fact eluded the individual; it
immediately becomes merely the relationship which was supposed to be sublated.
The law of the heart, through its very actualization, ceases to be a law of the heart. For
in its actualization it receives the form of Being, and is now universal power for which
this  heart is a matter of indifference, so that the individual, by                     setting up his own
order, no longer finds it to be his own. Consequently, what the individual brings
about through the actualization of his law, is not his law; on the contrary, since the
order is in itself his own, but for him an alien order, what the individual brings about
is merely the entanglement of himself in the actual order, an entanglement in it,
moreover, not as a superior power which is only alien to him, but hostile.—By his
deed the individual posits himself               in, or rather      as, the universal element of the
actuality in being, and his deed is supposed to have, even according to the sense he
attributes to it, the value of a universal order. But the individual has thereby freed
---
                                                 .                                

himself from himself; he goes on growing as universality for himself and purges
himself of singularity; the individual who wants to recognize universality only in the
form of his immediate Being-for-himself therefore fails to recognize himself in this
free universality, while at the same time he belongs to it, for it is his doing. This doing,
therefore, has the reverse significance, that of contradicting the universal order, for
the individual’s deed is supposed to be the deed of                        his  singular heart, not free
universal actuality; and at the same time he has in fact recognized the latter, for the
doing has the sense of positing his essence as free actuality, i.e. of recognizing the
actuality as his essence.1
   ¶373. The individual has, through the concept of his doing, determined the more
precise way in which the actual universality, to which he has attached himself,
turns against him. His deed, as actuality, belongs to the universal; but its content is
the very individuality which, as this singular                individuality, wants to preserve itself
in opposition to the universal. It is not any determinate law the setting-up of which
would be in question; on the contrary, the immediate unity of the singular heart
with universality is the thought, elevated into a supposedly valid law, that, in what
is law, every heart must recognize its own self. But only the heart of this individual
has posited its actuality in his deed, which expresses for him his Being-for-himself
or his pleasure. The deed is supposed to be immediately valid as a universal; that is
to say, it is in truth something particular, and has merely the form of universality;
the  particular     content of the deed is supposed,                as such, to rank as a universal.
Consequently, others do not find fulfilled in this content the law of their heart, but
rather the law of another heart; and, precisely in accordance with the universal law
that each shall find in what is law his own heart, they turn against the actuality the
heart set up, just as it turned against theirs. Thus, just as the individual at first finds only
the rigid law, now he finds the hearts of men themselves, opposed to his excellent
intentions and detestable.1
   ¶374. Because this consciousness at first knows universality only as                           immediate,
and necessity as necessity of the heart, the nature of the actualization and the efficacy
is unknown to it; it does not know that this actualization, as that which is, is in its
truth rather the universal in itself, in which the singularity of consciousness, which
entrusts itself to it in order to be this immediate singularity, perishes instead; instead
of this Being of its own, it therefore attains in Being the alienation of itself. But that in
which it does not recognize itself is no longer dead necessity, but necessity animated
by the universal individuality. It took this divine and human order, which it found in
force, to be a dead actuality in which those who belong to that order would, like itself—
which fixes itself as this heart, being for itself in opposition to the universal—have
no consciousness of themselves; but it                    finds instead that this order is really
animated by the consciousness of all, that it is the law of all hearts. It learns by
experience that the actuality is an order with life in it, and it experiences this in fact
precisely in actualizing the law of its own heart; for this means nothing else than
that individuality becomes an object to itself as a universal, but an object in which
consciousness does not recognize itself.1
   ¶375. Thus, for this shape of self-consciousness, what emerges from its experience
as the true, contradicts what this shape is for itself. But what it is for itself, has itself the
form of absolute universality for it, and it is the law of the heart which is immediately
---
      . (.) 

one with      self-consciousness. At the same time, the subsisting and living order is
equally its own essence and work; it produces nothing else but that; this order is in
equally immediate unity with self-consciousness. In this way self-consciousness
belongs to a twofold opposed essentiality, it is contradictory in itself and disrupted
in its innermost core. The law of this heart is only that in which self-consciousness
recognizes itself; but the universally valid order has, through the actualizing of that
law, equally become for self-consciousness its own essence and its own actuality; thus
what contradicts itself in its consciousness is the two terms, in the form of the essence
and of its own actuality for it.1
    ¶376. When self-consciousness announces this moment of its conscious downfall
and therein the result of its experience, it reveals itself as this inner inversion of itself,
as the derangement of consciousness, which                     finds that its essence is immediately
unessence, its actuality immediately an unactuality.—The derangement cannot be
taken to mean that in general something devoid of essence is regarded as essential,
something non-actual as actual, so that what for one of us is essential or actual would
not be so for another, and that the consciousness of actuality and non-actuality, or of
essentiality and unessentiality, would thus fall apart.—If something is in fact actual
and essential for consciousness in general, but is not so for me, then in the con-
sciousness of its nothingness I have at the same time, since I am consciousness in
general, the consciousness of its actuality,—and since they are both                          fixed, this is a
unity which is madness in general. But in this state only an object is deranged for
consciousness, not consciousness as such within and for itself. But in the result of
experience which has emerged here, consciousness, in its law, is conscious of itself as
this actuality; and at the same time, since the very same essentiality, the same actuality,
is alienated from it, it is, as self-consciousness, as absolute actuality, conscious of its
own unactuality, or the two sides count for it, in their contradiction, as immediately
its own essence, which is thus deranged in its inmost core.1
    ¶377. The heart-throb for the welfare of humanity therefore passes into the ravings
of a deranged self-conceit, into the fury of consciousness to preserve itself from
destruction; and it does this by expelling from itself the perversion which it is itself,
and by striving to look on it and express it as something else. It therefore speaks
of the universal order as a perversion of the law of the heart and its happiness a
perversion invented by fanatical priests, debauched despots and their minions, who
compensate themselves for their own degradation by degrading and oppressing
others, a perversion wielded to the nameless misery of deluded humanity.—In this
its derangement, consciousness declares individuality                      to be what is deranging and
perverted, but an alien and contingent individuality. It is the heart, however, or the
singularity of consciousness, immediately aspiring to universality, that is this deran-
ging and perverted principle itself, and the outcome of its doing is merely that this
contradiction comes to its consciousness. For the true is for it the law of the heart,—
something merely opined which has not, like the subsisting order, endured the light
of day, but rather, as soon as it is exposed to it, passes away. This its law ought to
have actuality; the law, then, as actuality, as valid order, is, to it, purpose and essence;
but actuality, that very law as valid order, is instead immediately to it the null and
void.—Similarly, its own actuality, the heart itself as singularity of consciousness, is
to itself the essence; but its purpose is to posit it                in being; thus it is rather its Self
---
                                                 .                                 

as something non-singular that is immediately for it the essence, or purpose as law,
hence as a universality, which it would be for its own consciousness.—This its concept
becomes, by its doing, its object; thus the heart undergoes experience rather of its Self as
the unactual, and of unactuality as its actuality. It is therefore not a contingent and alien
individuality, but just this heart, which in every aspect is, within itself, the perverted
and perverting.1
   ¶378. Since, however, the immediately universal individuality is the perverted and
the perverting, this universal order, since it is the law of all hearts, i.e. of what is
perverted, is itself no less the perverted in itself, as raving derangement declared. On
the one hand, this order proves itself to be a law of all hearts, by the resistance which
the law of a heart encounters in other singletons. The subsisting laws are defended
against the law of an individual, because they are not unconscious, empty, and dead
necessity, but spiritual universality and substance, in which those in whom this
spiritual substance has its actuality live as individuals, and are conscious of them-
selves; so that even when they complain about this order, as running counter to the
inner law, and maintain against it the opinions of the heart, in fact with their hearts
they cling to it as their essence, and if this order is taken from them, or they place
themselves outside it, they lose everything. Since it is precisely in this that the
actuality and power of the public order consist, this order thus appears as the essence
equal to itself, universally vivified, and individuality appears as the form of this
order.—But this order is equally a perversion. 1
   ¶379. For the fact that it is the law of all hearts, that all individuals are immediately
this universal, implies that the order is an actuality which is only the actuality of the
individuality that is for itself, or only the actuality of the heart. The consciousness
which sets up the law of its heart therefore experiences resistance from others, because
it contradicts the        equally singular       laws of their heart; and these others in their
resistance are doing nothing else but setting up and claiming validity for their law.
The universal that is present here is, then, only a universal resistance and struggle of all
against one another, in which each claims validity for his own singularity, but at the
same time does not succeed, because his singularity experiences the same resistance
and is dissolved reciprocally by the others. What seems to be public order, then, is this
universal hostility, in which each wrests what he can for himself, executes justice on
the singularity of others and establishes his own, which equally vanishes at the hands
of others. This order is the course of the world, the semblance of an unchanging course
that is only an opined universality, and whose content is rather the essenceless play of
establishing and dissolving singularities.1
   ¶380. If we consider the two sides of the universal order in comparison with each
other, then the latter universality has for its content the restless individuality for
which opinion or singularity is law, for which the actual is unactual, and the unactual
is the actual. But at the same time it is the side of the actuality of the order, for to it
belongs the       Being-for-itself     of individuality.—The other side is the                    universal     as
tranquil    essence, but for that very reason only as an                   interior, which, though it is
not nothing at all, still is no actuality and can itself become actual only by sublation of
the individuality which has arrogated actuality to itself. This shape of consciousness,
which consists in becoming for oneself in the law, in what is in itself true and good,
not as singularity but only as               essence, and yet in knowing individuality as the
---
     . (.) 

perverted and perverting, and therefore knowing that it must sacrifice singularity
of consciousness—this shape of consciousness is virtue.1
.         
¶381. In the first shape of active reason, self-consciousness took itself to be pure
individuality, and it was confronted by empty universality. In the second shape, the
two sides of the opposition each had both moments within them, law and individu-
ality; but one side, the heart, was their immediate unity, the other their opposition.
Here, in the relationship of virtue and the course of the world, each of the two
members is unity and opposition of these moments, or a movement of law and
individuality with regard to one another, but an opposed movement. To the con-
sciousness of virtue the law is the essential, and individuality is what is to be sublated,
and sublated therefore in individuality’s own consciousness as well as in the course of
the world. In this consciousness, the particular individuality is to be brought under
the discipline of the universal, what is in itself true and good; but under that
discipline it still remains a personal consciousness: true discipline is just the sacrifice
of the entire personality as proof that in fact consciousness does not still remain
attached to singularities. In this singular sacrifice, the individuality in the course of the
world    is at the same time eradicated, for it too is a simple moment common to
both.—In the course of the world, individuality behaves in a way which is the reverse
of its behaviour when it is posited in the virtuous consciousness, viz. it makes itself
the essence, whereas what is in itself good and true it subjugates to itself.—Further,
the course of the world, too, is for virtue not merely this universal                          perverted     by
individuality; on the contrary, the absolute                order    is likewise a common moment,
present for consciousness in the course of the world, only not as an actuality in being,
but as the      inner essence     of the course of the world. Therefore this order, strictly
speaking, has not        first to be produced by virtue, for producing is, as                    doing, con-
sciousness of individuality, and individuality is rather to be sublated; but this
sublating merely makes room, as it were, for the in-itself of the course of the world
to enter into existence in and for itself.1
    ¶382. The universal content of the actual course of the world has already emerged;
looked at more closely, it is again nothing else but the two preceding movements of
self-consciousness. From them has issued the shape of virtue; since they are its origin,
it has them before it; but virtue sets out to sublate its origin, and to realize itself, or to
become      for itself. The course of the world is thus, on the one hand, the single
individuality which seeks its pleasure and enjoyment, in doing so in fact                            finds its
downfall, and thereby satisfies the universal. But this very satisfaction, like the rest of
the moments of this relationship, is a perverted shape and movement of the univer-
sal. The actuality is only the singularity of the pleasure and enjoyment, whereas the
universal is opposed to it, a necessity which is merely the empty shape of the
universal, a merely negative reaction and a doing devoid of content.—The other
moment of the course of the world is individuality that in and for itself wants to be
law, and in this pretension disturbs the subsisting order; the universal law, it is true,
preserves itself in face of this self-conceit, and no longer makes its entry as something
opposed to consciousness and empty, as a dead necessity, but as a necessity within
consciousness itself. But, when it exists as the                conscious     relation of an absolutely
---
                                                 .                                 

contradictory actuality, it is derangement; when it is as an                            objective     actuality,
however, it is pervertedness in general. The universal, then, does display itself in
both sides as the power of their movement; but the existence of this power is merely a
universal perversion.1
   ¶383. It is from virtue now that the universal is supposed to receive its true
actuality by sublating individuality, the principle of the perversion; virtue’s purpose
is, by so doing, to reverse again the perverted course of the world and to produce its
true essence. This true essence is at first in the course of the world only as its in-itself;
it is not yet actual, and consequently virtue only                     believes in     it. This faith virtue
proceeds to elevate to vision, without, however, enjoying the fruits of its labour and
sacrifice. For insofar as it is individuality, it is the doing of the conflict it wages with
the course of the world; but its purpose and true essence is the defeat of the actuality
of the course of the world; the existence of the good thereby effected is thus the
cessation of its doing or of the consciousness of individuality.—What the outcome of
this conflict itself is, what experience virtue undergoes in it, whether, by the sacrifice
it undertakes, the course of the world succumbs while virtue triumphs—this must
be decided by the nature of the living                weapons      borne by the combatants. For the
weapons are nothing else but the essence of the combatants themselves, an essence
which comes to light only for both of them reciprocally. Their weapons have already
disclosed themselves from what in itself is present in this conflict.1
   ¶384. For the virtuous consciousness the                     universal    is genuine in        faith, or    in
itself, not yet an actual, but an abstract, universality; in this consciousness itself it is
as purpose, in the course of the world it is                   as its interior. It is precisely in this
determination that the universal, for the course of the world, presents itself in virtue
too; for virtue at first wills to accomplish the good, and does not, as yet, pass it off as
actuality. This determinacy can also be looked at in this way: the good, in entering the
lists in the conflict with the course of the world, thereby presents itself as being for an
other, as something that is not in and for itself, for otherwise it would not want to first
gain its truth by vanquishing its contrary. That it is, to begin with, only for an other,
means the same as was shown before in the opposite way of looking at it, viz. that it
is, to begin with, an abstraction which has reality, not in and for itself, but only in
its relationship.1
   ¶385. The good or universal, then, as it enters the scene here, is what are called
gifts, capacities, forces. It is a mode of being of the spiritual, in which it is represented
as a universal, which requires the principle of individuality for its vitality and
movement, and in individuality has its                 actuality. This universal is put to good use
by this principle, insofar as the principle is in the consciousness of virtue, but is
misused by it insofar as it is in the course of the world;—a passive instrument which,
controlled by the hand of free individuality, indifferent to the use it makes of it, can
also be misused for the production of an actuality, which is its destruction; a lifeless
material lacking an independence of its own, which can be formed this way or that,
and even to its own ruin.1
   ¶386. Since this universal is equally at the disposal of the consciousness of virtue
and the course of the world, it can hardly be foreseen whether virtue thus armed will
conquer vice. The weapons are the same; they are these capacities and forces. Virtue
has, it is true, set up an ambush: its faith in the original unity of its purpose and the
---
     . (.) 

essence of the course of the world, a unity that is supposed to fall on the enemy from
the rear during the        fight, and    in itself to accomplish that purpose, so that in fact,
because of this, for the knight of virtue his own doing and struggling is really a sham-
fight which he can not take seriously,—because he posits his genuine strength in the
fact that the good is       in and for itself, i.e. accomplishes itself,—a sham-fight that he
also dare not allow to become serious. For what he turns against the enemy and finds
turned against himself, and what he runs the risk of eroding and damaging in himself
as well as in his enemy, is supposed not to be the good itself; for he fights to preserve
and accomplish that; rather, what is risked in the fight is only the indifferent gifts and
capacities. But these are, in fact, nothing else but just that very universal devoid of
individuality, the universal which is supposed to be preserved and actualized by the
conflict.—But, at the same time, this universal is                already actualized immediately by
the very concept of the conflict; it is the in-itself, the universal; and its actualization
means only this, that it is at the same time for an other. The two sides specified above,
in accordance with each of which it became an abstraction, are no longer separated,
but in and through the conflict the good is posited in both modes at once.—The
virtuous consciousness, however, enters into conflict with the course of the world, as
something opposed to the good; what the course of the world offers to it in this
conflict is the universal, not only as an abstract universal, but as a universal animated
by individuality and being for an other, or the actual good. Therefore, wherever virtue
comes to grips with the course of the world, it always hits upon places which are the
actual existence of the good itself which, as the in-itself of the course of the world, is
inextricably interwoven in every appearance of the course of the world and also has
its Being-there in the actuality of the course of the world; for virtue, therefore, the
course of the world is invulnerable. All the moments which in virtue itself were
supposed to be risked and sacrificed, are just such existences of the good, and hence
are inviolable relationships. Consequently, the conflict can only be an oscillation
between preserving and sacrificing; or rather there can be no place either for a
sacrifice of what is one’s own, or for a violation of what is alien. Not only is virtue
like the combatant who, in the conflict, is only concerned with keeping his sword
bright, but it has even started the fight in order to preserve the weapons; and not only
can it not use its own weapons, it must also preserve intact those of the enemy and
protect them against its own attack, for all are noble parts of the good, on behalf of
which it went into battle.1
   ¶387. For this enemy, on the other hand, the essence is not the                              in-itself, but
individuality; its force is therefore the negative principle for which nothing is
subsistent and absolutely sacred, but which can risk and endure the loss of anything
and everything. Its victory is therefore as certain intrinsically as it is through the
contradiction in which its opponent gets entangled. What for virtue is in itself is, for
the course of the world, only for it; the course of the world is free from every moment
that for virtue is firm and to which it is bound. Such a moment the course of the
world has in its power, since it regards it as something it can either sublate or let
subsist; and in its power too it has the virtuous knight attached to this moment. The
knight cannot disentangle himself from it, as if it were a cloak thrown round him
from which he could free himself by leaving it behind; for to him it is the essence that
cannot be sublated.1

    ¶388. Finally, as regards the ambush from which the good in-itself is supposed to
fall upon the course of the world cunningly from the rear, this is in itself a vain hope.
The course of the world is the alert consciousness, certain of itself, that cannot be got
at from behind, but faces in every direction; for its nature is that everything is for it,
that everything stands in front of it. But the good in-itself, if it is for its enemy, then it
is in the conflict we have seen; but insofar as it is not for him, but in itself, it is the
passive instrument of gifts and capacities, a material lacking actuality; represented as
Being-there, it would be a dormant consciousness, remaining in the background, one
knows not where.1
    ¶389. Virtue, therefore, is conquered by the course of the world because its
purpose is, in fact, the abstract, unactual essence and because, as regards actuality,
its doing rests on        distinctions     which lie in words alone. It wanted to consist in
bringing the good into           actuality    by the     sacrifice of individuality, but the side of
actuality is itself nothing else but the side of individuality. The good was supposed
to be that which is in itself and opposed to what is; but the in-itself, taken in its reality
and truth, is rather Being itself. The in-itself is, initially, the abstraction of essence in
contrast to actuality; but abstraction is precisely that which is not genuine, but only
for consciousness, which means, however, that it is itself that which is called actual;
for the actual is what is essentially for an other, or it is Being. But the consciousness of
virtue rests on this distinction between the in-itself and Being, a distinction which has
no truth.—The course of the world was supposed to be the perversion of the good
because it had       individuality      for its principle; but individuality is the principle of
actuality; for it is precisely individuality that is consciousness, whereby that-which-is-
in-itself is equally for an other; the course of the world does pervert the unchangeable,
but it perverts it in fact from the nothing of abstraction into the Being of reality. 1
    ¶390. Thus the course of the world triumphs over what, in opposition to it,
constitutes virtue; it triumphs over virtue, for which the essenceless abstraction is
the essence. However, it does not triumph over something real but over the creation
of distinctions that are no distinctions, over this pompous talk about the supreme
good of humanity, about the oppression of humanity, about sacrifices for the good,
and the misuse of gifts;—ideal essences and purposes of this kind crumble as empty
words which lift up the heart and leave reason empty, which edify, but raise no
edifice; declamations which express no content determinately, except that the indi-
vidual who professes to act for such noble purposes and who deals in such                                fine
phrases is in his own eyes an excellent creature;—a puffing-up which expands his
head in his own eyes and in the eyes of others, but expands it with an empty
swelling.—Ancient virtue had its determinate secure meaning, for it had in the
substance     of the people its        contentful foundation, and for its purpose an                  actual
good already in existence; consequently, too, it was not directed against actuality as
against a universal perversion, and against a course of the world. But the virtue we are
considering is outside the substance, a virtue devoid of essence, a virtue only of
representation and words, words that lack that content.—This emptiness of the
rhetoric struggling with the course of the world would be exposed at once if one
had to say what its phrases mean;—they are therefore presupposed as familiar. The
demand to put the familiar into words would be fulfilled either by a fresh flood of
phrases or countered by an appeal to the heart, which inwardly says what they mean;
---
     . (.) 

that is, by a confession of inability to say it in fact.—The nullity of this rhetoric seems,
too, in an unconscious way to have acquired certainty for the culture of our time,
since all interest in the whole mass of those phrases, and the manner of                             flaunting
oneself with them, has vanished; a loss which is expressed in the fact that they give
rise only to boredom.1
   ¶391. The result, then, which issues from this opposition consists in conscious-
ness’s discarding like an empty cloak the representation of a good in itself, that has as
yet no actuality. In its conflict it has learnt by experience that the course of the world
is not as bad as it looked; for its actuality is the actuality of the universal. With this
experience, the means of producing the good through the sacrifice                           of individuality
falls away; for individuality is precisely the actualization of what is-in-itself; and the
perversion ceases to be regarded as a perversion of the good, for it is instead precisely
the conversion of the good, as a mere purpose, into actuality; the movement of
individuality is the reality of the universal.1
   ¶392. However, with this result, that which as course of the world stood opposed to
the consciousness of what is-in-itself, has in fact likewise been conquered and has
vanished. In that opposition, the Being-for-itself of individuality was opposed to the
essence or the universal, and appeared as an actuality separated from Being-in-itself.
But since it has come to light that actuality is in undivided unity with the universal,
then, just as the in-itself of virtue is merely a view, 1 so does the Being-for-itself of the
course of the world also prove to be no more. The individuality of the course of the
world may well opine that it acts only for itself or self-interestedly; it is better than it
opines, its doing is at the same time a doing that is-in-itself, universal. When it acts
self-interestedly, it simply does not know what it is doing; and when it avers that all
men act self-interestedly, it is simply affirming that none of them knows what doing
is.—When it acts for itself, this is just bringing into actuality what, at first, is only in-
itself; thus the purpose of the            Being-for-itself, a purpose which opines that it is
opposed to the in-itself,—its empty cunning, as well as its                        finespun explanations
which know how to point out self-interest everywhere—all these have vanished,
along with the purpose of the in-itself and its rhetoric.2
   ¶393. Thus the         doing and activity of individuality              is an    end in itself;    it is the
employment of forces, the play of their manifestations,                     that gives them life, when
otherwise they would be the dead in-itself; the in-itself is not an unfulfilled abstract
universal devoid of existence, but it is itself immediately the presence and actuality of
the process of individuality.1
C. Individuality which takes itself to be real in and for itself
¶394. Self-consciousness has now grasped the concept of itself which, at                             first, was
only our concept of it, viz. that in the certainty of itself it is all reality; and from now
on purpose and essence are to it the self-moving interpenetration of the universal—of
the gifts and capacities—and the individuality.—The singular moments of this
fulfilling and interpenetration,           before the unity       in which they have coalesced, are
the purposes hitherto considered. These have vanished, as abstractions and chimeras
that belong to those first insipid shapes of spiritual self-consciousness, and have their
truth only in the opined Being of the heart, of imagination and rhetoric, not in
reason. Reason, now certain in and for itself of its reality, no longer seeks only to
---
                                                 .                                

produce itself as purpose in opposition to the actuality immediately-in-being but, on
the contrary, has the category as such for the object of its consciousness.—That is, the
determination of self-consciousness as being for itself, or negative, the determination
in which reason         first entered the scene, is sublated;            this  self-consciousness        found
before it an actuality which was supposedly the negative of it, and only by sublating it
could it actualize its own purpose. But since purpose and Being-in-itself have proved
to be the same thing as Being for another and the actuality found before it, truth no
longer separates from certainty, no matter whether the posited purpose is taken as
certainty of self and the actualization of the purpose as the truth or, alternatively, the
purpose is taken for the truth and the actuality for certainty; on the contrary,
the essence and the purpose in and for itself is the certainty of immediate reality
itself, the interpenetration of Being-in-itself and Being-for-itself, of the universal and
the individuality; the doing is within its own self its truth and actuality, and the
presentation or the expression of the individuality is, for this doing, the purpose in and
for itself.1
    ¶395. With this concept of itself, therefore, self-consciousness has returned into
itself out of the opposed determinations which the category had for it, and which
were involved in its approach to the category, as observing self-consciousness and
then as active self-consciousness. It has for its object the pure category itself, or it is
the category which has become conscious of itself. Its account with its previous
shapes is thereby closed; they lie in oblivion behind it, they do not confront it as its
world found before it, but develop solely within itself as transparent moments. Yet
they still fall apart in its consciousness as a                  movement        of distinct moments, a
movement which has not yet concentrated itself into its substantial unity. But in all
these moments self-consciousness holds fast the simple unity of Being and the Self, a
unity which is their genus.1
    ¶396. Consciousness has thereby cast off all opposition and every condition of
its doing; it starts afresh        from itself, and aims not at            an other, but      at itself. Since
individuality is in its own self actuality, the material of its operation and the purpose
of the doing lie in the doing itself. The doing has, therefore, the aspect of the
movement of a circle which moves freely within itself in a void, which, unimpeded,
now expands, now contracts, and quite contentedly plays only in and with its own
self. The element in which individuality presents its shape has the significance of a
pure reception of this shape; it is the daylight in general, to which consciousness
wants to display itself. The doing alters nothing and goes against nothing; it is the
pure form of transposition from                not-being-seen       into   being-seen, and the content
which is brought out into the daylight and displays itself, is nothing other than
what this doing already is in itself. It is in itself: this is its form as unity in thought;
and it is actual—this is its form as unity in being; the doing itself is a content only in
this determination of simplicity, in contrast to the determination of its transition and
its movement.1

¶397. This individuality, real in itself, is at              first again a     singular    and   determinate
individuality; it knows itself as the absolute reality, and this absolute reality is therefore,
as individuality becomes conscious of it, an abstract, universal reality, which, without
---
     . (.) 

filling and content, is merely the empty thought of this category.—We have to see how
this concept of the individuality real in itself determines itself in its moments, and how
its concept of itself enters into its consciousness.1
   ¶398. The concept of this individuality, which, as such, is for itself all reality, is
initially a result; individuality has not yet presented its movement and reality, and is
posited here      immediately as simple Being-in-itself. Negativity, however, which is the
same as that which appears as movement, is in the simple in-itself as determinacy; and
Being or the simple in-itself, becomes a determinate range. Accordingly, individuality
enters the scene as an original determinate nature,—as                        original   nature, for it     is in
itself,—as originally determinate, for the negative is in the in-itself and this latter is thus
a quality. This limitation of Being, however, can not limit the doing of consciousness,
for here consciousness is a completed act of relating itself to itself; relation to an other,
which the limitation of consciousness would be, is sublated. The original determinacy
of the nature is, therefore, only a simple principle,—a transparent universal element, in
which the individuality remains just as free and equal to itself as it is unimpeded in
unfolding its differences in it, and in its actualization is pure interaction with itself. Just
as indeterminate animal-life breathes its breath of life, say, into the element of water, or
air or earth, and within these again into more determinate principles, plunges all its
moments into them, yet, despite this restriction of the element, keeps them in its power
and maintains itself in its unity and, as this particular organization, remains the same
universal animal-life.1
   ¶399. This determinate original nature of consciousness, which remains freely and
entirely in this nature, appears as the immediate and sole proper                             content    of that
which for the individual is his purpose; admittedly, it is a determinate content, but it
is only a content at all insofar as we consider the Being-in-itself in isolation; in truth,
however, it is reality permeated by individuality, actuality when consciousness, as
singular, has it within it, and when it is initially posited as being, not yet as doing. For
doing, however, that determinacy is, on the one hand, not a limitation it would aspire
to overcome, because, regarded as a quality in being, it is the simple colour of the
element in which the doing moves; but on the other hand, the negativity is                                 deter-
minacy only in Being; but doing is itself nothing else but negativity; so in the active
individuality determinacy is dissolved into negativity in general or into the inclusive
concept of all determinacy.1
   ¶400. In     doing and the consciousness of doing, the simple original nature now
enters into the difference which pertains to doing. At first, doing is present as object,
and indeed as object such that it still belongs to consciousness, present as purpose,
and hence opposed to an actuality present at hand. The                              other    moment is the
movement of the purpose represented as at rest, the actualization as the relation of
the purpose to the wholly formal actuality, hence the representation of the transition
itself, or the means. The third moment is, finally, the object, no longer as purpose, of
which the doer is immediately conscious as its own, but as it is out in the open and as
an other for the doer.—But now in accordance with the concept of this sphere these
diverse sides are to be established in such a way that the content in them remains the
same and no distinction enters in, whether between individuality and Being in
general, or of the purpose in contrast to individuality as original nature, or in contrast
to the actuality at hand; or again of the means in contrast to actuality as absolute
---
                                                .                               

purpose, or of the actuality effected in contrast to the purpose, or the original nature,
or the means.1
   ¶401. First of all, then, the originally determinate nature of individuality, its
immediate essence, is not as yet posited as active, and so is called particular capacity,
talent, character, and so on. This peculiar tinge of spirit is to be regarded as the sole
content of the purpose itself and as the sole reality. If we represented consciousness
as going beyond this content, and as wanting to bring another content to actuality,
then we would represent it as a nothing working towards the nothing.—Further, this
original essence is not merely the content of the purpose, but is in itself also the
actuality, which otherwise appears as the                given material of the doing, as actuality
found beforehand and to be formed in the doing. That is to say, doing is only pure
transposition from the form of not yet presented Being into that of presented Being;
the Being-in-itself of that actuality opposed to consciousness has declined to a mere
empty show. This consciousness, then, when determining itself to action, does not
let itself be led astray by the show of the actuality at hand, and equally it has to stop
floundering about in empty thoughts and purposes, and stick to the original content
of its essence. True, this original content is only                   for   consciousness       once it has
actualized it; but the distinction between something that is for                      consciousness only
within consciousness itself, and an actuality outside it that is in itself, has fallen
away.—Consciousness must act merely in order that what it is in itself should be for
it, or action is just the coming-to-be of spirit as consciousness. What consciousness
is in itself, it thus knows from its actuality. Therefore, the individual cannot know
what he is until he has brought himself to actuality through doing.—However, in
that case he seems unable to determine the purpose of his doing until he has done it;
but at the same time, since he is consciousness, he must have the action before him
in advance as       entirely his own, i.e. as        purpose. The individual going into action
seems, therefore, to find himself in a circle in which each moment already presup-
poses the other, and thus he seems unable to find a beginning, because he gets to
know his original essence, which must be his purpose, only from the deed, while, in
order to do it, he must have the purpose beforehand. But for that very reason he has
to start    immediately, and, whatever the circumstances, without further scruples
about beginning, means, or end, proceed to activity; for his essence and his nature,
being-in-itself, is beginning, means, and end, all in one. As beginning, this nature is
at hand in the       circumstances of the action; and the               interest   which the individual
finds in something is the answer already given to the question: whether and what is
to be done here. For what seems to be an actuality found before him is in itself his
original nature, which has merely the semblance of a Being,—a semblance that lies
in the concept of self-dividing doing, but which announces itself as                            his  original
nature by the interest he finds in this actuality.—Similarly, the how or the means is
determined in and for itself. Talent              is likewise nothing else but the determinate,
original individuality considered as              inner means        or   transition    from purpose to
actuality. But the actual         means and the real transition are the unity of talent with
the nature of the Thing, present in that interest: talent represents in the means the
side of doing, interest the side of content, both are the individuality itself, as an
interpenetration of Being and doing. What is at hand, therefore, are circumstances
found before him, which in themselves are the individual’s original nature; next, the
---
     . (.) 

interest which posits the circumstances as what is its own or as purpose; finally, the
connection and sublation of this opposition in the means. This connection itself still
falls within consciousness and the whole just considered is one side of an oppos-
ition. This still remaining semblance of opposition, is sublated by the                            transition
itself or the means;—for the means is unity of the outer and inner, the contrary of
the determinacy it has as inner             means; it therefore sublates this determinacy and
posits itself—this unity of doing and Being—equally as an outer, as the individuality
itself becomes actual, i.e. as the individuality which is posited for individuality itself
as the being. In this way, the entire action does not go outside itself, either as the
circumstances, or as purpose, or means, or as work. 1
    ¶402. But with the work the difference of the original natures seems to enter; the
work, like the individual’s original nature it expresses, is something determinate; for
the negativity freely discharged by the doing as an actuality in being, inheres in the
work as a quality. Consciousness, however, in the face of the work, determines itself
as that which has in it the determinacy as negativity in general, as doing; it is thus the
universal in contrast to that determinacy of the work; it can therefore compare the
work with other works, and thereby apprehend the individualities themselves as
diverse, apprehend the individual who ventures further in his work either as greater
energy of will or as a richer nature, i.e. a nature whose original determinacy is less
limited; another, by contrast, as a weaker and poorer nature.1
    ¶403. In contrast with this unessential difference of magnitude, the good and bad
would express an absolute difference; but this has no place here. In whichever of these
two ways something might be taken, it is in like manner a doing and a feat, a self-
presentation and self-expression of an individuality, and for that reason it is all good;
and it would really be impossible to say what badness was supposed to be.—What
would be called a bad work is the individual life of a determinate nature, which
actualizes itself in it; it would be degraded into a bad work only by the comparative
thought, which, however, is an empty thing, since it goes beyond the essence of the
work, which consists in being a self-expression of the individuality, and seeks and
demands in it one knows not what else besides.—The comparative thought could
only concern the above-mentioned difference. But this, as a difference of magnitude,
is in itself an inessential difference, and here for the determinate reason that what is
compared with each other would be different works or individualities; but these do
not concern each other at all; each is related only to itself. The original nature alone is
the   in-itself, or what could be laid down as a standard for judging the work, and
conversely; both, however, correspond to each other, there is nothing for the indi-
viduality that is not from          it, or there is no      actuality    that is not the individuality’s
nature and its doing, and no doing nor in-itself of the individuality that is not actual,
and only these moments are to be compared.1
    ¶404. Therefore, there is no place at all for either exaltation, or lamentation, or
repentance; for all that sort of thing stems from the thought that imagines another
content     and another in-itself than the original nature of the individual and its
execution present in actuality. Whatever it is that the individual does, and whatever
happens to him, he has done it himself, and he is it himself; he can have only the
consciousness of the pure transposition of himself from the night of possibility into
the day of presence, from the abstract in-itself into the significance of actual Being,
---
                                                 .                               

and the certainty that what happens to him in the latter is nothing else but what lay
dormant in the former. It is true that the consciousness of this unity is likewise a
comparison, but what is compared has merely the                           semblance      of opposition; a
semblance of form which, for the self-consciousness of reason, aware that individu-
ality in its own self is actuality, is nothing more than semblance. So the individual,
since he knows that in his actuality he can find nothing else but its unity with himself,
or only the certainty of himself in its truth, can savour only joy in himself.1
    ¶405. This is the concept which consciousness, certain of itself as absolute inter-
penetration of individuality and Being, forms of itself; let us see whether this concept
is confirmed by experience, and whether its reality squares with it. The work is the
reality which consciousness gives itself; it is that in which the individual is for
consciousness what he is in himself, and in such a manner that the consciousness,
for which the individual becomes in the work, is not particular consciousness, but
universal     consciousness; in the work in general, consciousness has ventured forth
into the element of universality, into the space of Being, devoid of determinacy. The
consciousness which withdraws from its work is in fact the universal conscious-
ness,—because, in this opposition, it becomes the absolute negativity or the doing,—
in contrast to its work, which is the determinate work; it thus goes beyond itself as the
work, and is itself the space devoid of determinacy, which is left unfilled by its work.
But if their unity maintained itself before in the concept, this happened just because
the work as a work in being was sublated. But it is supposed to be, and we have to see
how in its Being the individuality will maintain its universality, and will know how
to satisfy itself.—In the first place, we have to consider for itself the work that has
come about. It has received into itself the whole nature of the individuality; its
Being is therefore itself a doing in which all differences interpenetrate and dissolve;
the work is thus cast out into a subsistence in which the determinacy of the original
nature in fact rounds on other determinate natures, encroaches on them, as these
others encroach on it, and gets lost as a vanishing element in this universal move-
ment. If within the concept of the individuality, real in and for itself, all moments—
circumstances, purpose, means, and the actualization—are equal to each other, and
the original determinate nature counts only as universal element, yet on the other
hand, when this element becomes objective Being, its determinacy as such comes to
the light of day in the work, and obtains its truth in its dissolution. More precisely,
this dissolution presents itself thus: in this determinacy the individual, as                              this
individual, has become actual to himself; but the determinacy is not only the content
of the actuality, but equally its form, or the actuality as such in general is just this
determinacy of being opposed to self-consciousness. From this side, the actuality
turns out to be an actuality that has vanished from the concept, and is merely an alien
actuality found there. The work is, i.e. it is for other individualities, and is for them an
alien actuality, in place of which             they   must posit their own actuality in order to
acquire through their doing the consciousness of their unity with actuality; or their
interest in this work, an interest posited through                   their  original nature, is another
interest than the        peculiar    interest of this work, which is thereby converted into
something else. Thus the work is in general something transient, which is obliterated
by the counter-play of other forces and interests, and presents the reality of the
individuality as vanishing rather than accomplished.1
---
     . (.) 

   ¶406. In its work, then, there arises for consciousness the opposition of doing and
Being, an opposition which in the earlier shapes of consciousness was at the same
time the beginning of doing, while here it is only a result. But in fact this opposition
likewise lay at the foundation, when consciousness went into action as individuality
real in itself; for the determinate original nature was presupposed as the in-itself for
the action, and pure accomplishment for the sake of accomplishment had this
nature as     content. Pure doing, however, is the form                  equal to    itself, to which the
determinacy of the original nature is thus unequal. Here, as elsewhere, it is a matter
of indifference which of the two is called concept                   and which       reality; the original
nature is what is thought or is the in-itself in contrast to the doing in which it first
has its reality; or the original nature is the Being               both of the individuality as such
and of the individuality as the work, while doing is the original concept as absolute
transition, or as the coming-to-be. This disparity between concept and reality, which
lies in the essence of the concept, is what consciousness experiences in its work; in
the work, therefore, consciousness becomes to itself what it is in truth, and its empty
concept of itself vanishes.1
   ¶407. In this fundamental contradiction of the work—the work which is the truth
of this individuality that is, to itself, real in itself—all the sides of the individuality
thus enter the scene again as contradictory; or the work, as the content of the whole
individuality, when transported into               Being   from the      doing, which is the negative
unity holding captive all the moments, now lets the moments go free; and in the
element of subsistence they become indifferent to one another. Concept and reality
thus separate as purpose and as that which is the original essentiality. It is contingent
that the purpose has a genuine essence, or that the in-itself is made the purpose.
Likewise, concept and reality again separate from one another as                           transition     into
actuality and as purpose; or it is contingent that the means is chosen which expresses
the purpose. And finally, taking these inner moments together, whether they have
within them an inner unity or not, the doing of the individual is again contingent
with regard to actuality in general; fortune decides just as well for an ill-determined
purpose and ill-chosen means, as against them.1
   ¶408. If, now, consciousness thereby becomes aware in its work of the opposition
between willing and achieving, between the purpose and the means, and, again,
between this interior in its entirety and the actuality itself, of what in general the
contingency of its doing involves            within itself, then the        unity   and necessity of the
doing are nevertheless equally present, too; the latter side overlaps the former, and
the experience of the contingency of the doing is itself only a contingent experience.
The necessity      of the doing consists in the fact that purpose                 is purely and simply
related to     actuality, and this unity is the concept of doing; action takes place
because doing is in and for itself the essence of actuality. In the work, of course,
there emerges the contingency that being-accomplished has, as against willing and
accomplishing; and this experience, which seems as if it must count as truth,
contradicts that concept of action. If, however, we consider the content of this
experience in its completeness, then this content is the                      vanishing work; what is
preserved is not the vanishing: the vanishing is itself actual and is bound up with the
work and vanishes with it; the             negative itself goes to ruin         along with the positive
whose negative it is. 1

    ¶409. This vanishing of the vanishing lies in the concept of individuality itself, the
individuality that is real in itself; for that in which the work vanishes or what vanishes
in the work, and what was supposed to give experience, as it has been called, its
supremacy over individuality’s own concept of itself, is the objective actuality; but
objective actuality is a moment which even in this consciousness itself no longer has
any truth for itself; truth consists solely in the unity of consciousness with the doing,
and the true work is only that unity of doing and Being, of willing and achieving. To
consciousness, then, because of the certainty underlying its action, the actuality
opposed to that certainty is itself such as to be for consciousness only; to consciousness
as self-consciousness which has returned into itself, and for which all opposition has
vanished, opposition can no longer come about in this form of consciousness’s Being-
for-itself as against actuality; on the contrary, the opposition and the negativity that
come to light in the work affect not merely the content of the work                              or  even the
content of consciousness, but the actuality as such, and hence affect the opposition
present only in that actuality, and present only in virtue of it, and the vanishing of the
work. In this way, then, consciousness is reflected out of its transient work into itself,
and affirms its concept and certainty as what                     is  and   endures     in the face of the
experience of the        contingency      of doing; it experiences in fact its concept, in which
actuality is only a moment, something for consciousness, not the in- and for-itself; it
experiences actuality as a vanishing moment, and actuality therefore counts for
consciousness only as          Being   in general, whose universality is the same thing as the
doing. This unity is the true work; the work is the Thing itself, which affirms itself
completely and is experienced as that which endures, independently of the Thing that
is the   contingency of the individual doing as such, the contingency of the circum-
stances, means, and actuality.1
    ¶410. The       Thing itself    is only opposed to these moments insofar as they are
supposed to be valid in isolation, but as an interpenetration of the actuality and the
individuality it is essentially their unity; it is equally a doing and, as doing, pure doing
in general, hence just as much a doing of this individual; and it is this doing as still
belonging to him in opposition to actuality, as purpose; equally, it is the transition
from this determinacy into the opposed determinacy, and lastly it is an                              actuality
which is present         for consciousness. The          Thing itself      thus expresses the         spiritual
essentiality in which all these moments are sublated as valid for themselves, and
are valid therefore only as universal, and in which for consciousness its certainty of
itself is objective essence, a Thing; the object engendered by self-consciousness as its
own object, without ceasing to be a free and authentic object.—The thing of sensory
certainty and of perceiving now has its significance through self-consciousness and
for self-consciousness alone; on this rests the distinction between a                            thing   and a
Thing.—A movement corresponding to sensory certainty and perception will run
its course here.1
    ¶411. In the Thing itself, then, as the interpenetration of individuality and object-
ivity that has itself become objective, self-consciousness has come into possession of
its true concept of itself, or has attained to consciousness of its substance. At the same
time, as it is here, it is a consciousness that has come about just now, and hence an
immediate consciousness of its substance, and this is the determinate way in which
spiritual essence is present here and it has not yet developed into a genuinely real
---

substance. The Thing itself has, in this immediate consciousness of its substance, the
form of the simple essence which, as a universal, contains within itself all its various
moments and is appropriate to them, but, again, is also indifferent to them as
determinate moments and free for itself, and as this free simple, abstract Thing itself
counts as the essence. The various moments of the original determinacy or of the
Thing of this individual, of his purpose, of the means, of the doing itself, and of the
actuality, are for this consciousness, on the one hand, single moments which it can
abandon and surrender in favour of the Thing itself; but on the other hand, they all
have the Thing itself as their essence but only in such a way that it, as their abstract
universal, is to be found in each of these various moments, and can be a predicate of
them. The Thing itself is not yet the subject; but those moments count as subject
because they fall on the side of singularity in general, whereas the Thing itself is at
first only the simple universal. It is the genus which is found in all these moments as
species of itself, and is likewise free of them. 1
   ¶412. Consciousness is called honest when it has on the one hand attained to this
idealism that the Thing itself expresses, and on the other hand has in the Thing itself,
as this formal universality, the true; a consciousness which is always concerned
solely with the Thing itself and therefore busies itself solely with the various
moments or species of it; and when it does not attain the Thing itself in one of
these moments or in one meaning, it for that very reason gets hold of it in another,
and consequently does in fact always obtain the satisfaction which it should enjoy in
accordance with its concept. Whichever way things turn out, it has accomplished
and attained the Thing itself, for, as this universal genus of those moments, it is the
predicate of them all.1
   ¶413. If this consciousness does not bring a purpose to actuality, yet it has after
all willed it, i.e. it makes the purpose as purpose, the mere doing which does nothing,
into the Thing itself, and can therefore express and console itself with the fact that all
the same something was              done    and    set afoot. Since the universal itself contains
subsumed under it the negative or the vanishing, the fact that the work annihilates
itself, this too is its doing; it has provoked the others to this, and in the vanishing of its
actuality still   finds satisfaction, like naughty boys who enjoy themselves                       when they
get their ears boxed just because they are the cause of it. Or, again, suppose it has not
even attempted to carry out the Thing itself and has done absolutely nothing, then it
has not been able to; the Thing itself is to it just the unity of its resolve and the reality;
it asserts that the actuality        would be nothing else but what it was                 possible   for it to
do.—Finally, suppose something of interest to it in general has come its way without
any effort on its part, then to it this actuality is the Thing itself just in the interest it
finds in it, even though that actuality has not been produced by itself; if it is a stroke
of luck that has befallen it personally, then it embraces it as its deed and desert; if, on
the other hand, it is a world-event of no special concern to it, it makes it likewise its
own; and a deedless interest serves it as a party, which it has taken for or against, and
combated or espoused. 1
   ¶414. The honesty of this consciousness, as well as the satisfaction that it every-
where enjoys, obviously consists in fact in its not bringing together the thoughts it has
about the Thing itself. To it, the Thing itself is as much its own Thing as not a work at
all, or  pure doing     and an empty purpose, or even a               deedless actuality; it makes one
---
                                                 .                               

meaning after another the subject of this predicate, and forgets them one after
another. Now, in merely having-willed, or even in having-been-incapable, the
Thing itself has the meaning of an                empty purpose        and of a unity of willing and
achieving only        in thought. The consolation for the annihilation of the purpose,
having willed after all, or done something purely after all, as well as the satisfaction
of having given others something to do, makes                     pure doing, or the thoroughly bad
work, the essence; for that work is to be called bad which is no work at all. Finally, in
the lucky event of finding the actuality before it, this Being without deed becomes the
Thing itself.1
    ¶415. The truth of this honesty, however, is to be not as honest as it looks. For it
cannot be so thoughtless as to let these various moments in fact fall apart; it must
have immediate consciousness about their opposition because they are purely and
simply related to each other. The pure doing is essentially the doing of this individual,
and this doing is just as essentially an actuality or a Thing. Conversely, the actuality is
essentially only as his doing and as doing in general                   as well; and his doing is at the
same time only as doing in general; so actuality too. While, then, it seems to the
individual that his concern is only with the Thing itself as abstract actuality, it is also a
fact that he is concerned with it as his own doing. But equally, while he is concerned
merely with doing and activity, he is not really in earnest about it; rather, he has only
to do with a Thing and with the Thing as his own. Finally, while he seems to will only
his Thing and his doing, he is again concerned with the Thing in general or with the
actuality enduring in and for itself.1
    ¶416. Just as the Thing itself and its moments appear here as                          content, equally
necessarily, too, they are as forms in consciousness. They enter the scene as content
only to vanish, each making room for the other. They must therefore be present in
the determinacy of sublated moments; but they are thus sides of consciousness itself.
The Thing itself is present as the in-itself or the reflection into itself of consciousness;
but the supplanting of the moments by one another expresses itself in consciousness
in their being posited in consciousness, not in themselves but only for another. One
of the moments of the content is exposed by it to the light of day and represented for
others; but consciousness is at the same time reflected back from it into itself and the
opposite moment is equally present within it; consciousness retains it for itself as its
own. At the same time too it is not just some one of the moments that is                                merely
exposed to the outside, and another that is merely retained in the interior; on the
contrary, consciousness alternates with them, for it must make the one as well as the
other the essential moment for itself and for the others. The whole is the self-moving
interpenetration of the individuality and the universal; but because this whole is
present for this consciousness only as the simple essence, and thus as the abstraction
of the Thing itself, its moments fall as separated outside the Thing itself and outside
each other; and,        as a whole, it is exhaustively presented only by the separating
alternation of exposure and of retention-for-itself. Since in this alternation conscious-
ness has one moment for itself and as essential in its reflection, but another only
externally in it, or for the others, there thus enters a play of individualities with one
another in which each and all find themselves both deceiving and deceived.1
    ¶417. So an individuality sets about carrying something out; it thereby seems to
have made something the Thing; it acts, and in acting becomes for others, and seems
---
     . (.) 

to be having to do with actuality. The others therefore take its doing for an interest in
the Thing as such and for the purpose of the Thing’s being accomplished in itself, no
matter whether by the first individuality or by them. Accordingly, when they point
out that this Thing has already been brought about by them, or, if it has not, offer and
furnish their assistance, then this consciousness has really left the position they opine
it to occupy; what interests it in the Thing itself is its own                   doing and activity, and
when they become aware that this was the Thing itself, then they feel cheated.—But in
fact their eagerness to come and help was itself nothing else but a desire to see and
display their own doing, not the Thing itself; that is, they wanted to deceive the others
in just the way that they complain of having been deceived.—Now that it is clear that
one’s   own doing       and   activity, the play of        one’s forces, count as the Thing itself,
consciousness seems to ply its essence               for itself, not for the others, and concerned
only about doing as its own doing, not about doing as the doing of others, it thereby
seems to let the others have their own way equally in their Thing. But again they are
mistaken; this consciousness has already left the position they opined it to occupy. It
has to do not with the Thing as this singular Thing of its own, but with it as Thing, as a
universal, which is for everyone. It interferes, therefore, in their doing and their work,
and, if it can no longer take the work out of their hands, it at least shows an interest in
it by the fact that it busies itself with passing judgement on it; if it gives it the stamp of
its approval and its praise, this is meant in the sense that, in the work, it praises not
only the work itself, but at the same time its own generosity and moderation in not
having damaged the work as a work, nor damaged it by its censure. In showing an
interest in the work, it is enjoying its own self in it; and the work which it censures is
equally welcome to it for just this enjoyment of                    its own    doing which its censure
provides. But those who think, or pretend, that they have been deceived by this
interference, really wanted to practise the same kind of deceit themselves. They pass
off their doing and activity as something for themselves alone in which their only
purpose was themselves and their own essence. However, in doing something, and
thus presenting and exposing themselves to the light of day, they immediately
contradict by their deed their pretence of wanting to exclude the light of day itself,
the universal consciousness, and the participation of everyone; actualization is, on the
contrary, a display of what is one’s own in the universal element whereby it becomes,
and should become, the Thing of everyone.1
   ¶418. It is, then, equally a deception of oneself and of others if one purports to have
to do with the pure Thing alone; a consciousness that broaches a Thing soon finds by
experience that others hurry along like flies to freshly poured milk, and want to have
a hand in it; and they find in this consciousness that it too has to do with the Thing,
not as an object, but as its own Thing. On the other hand, if what is supposed to be
essential is only the        doing itself, the employment of forces and capacities, or the
expression of this individuality, then equally they find by experience mutually that
they   all busy themselves and regard themselves as invited, and instead of a                             mere
doing, or a singular proprietary doing, rather something has been broached that is for
others as well, or a Thing itself. In both cases the same thing happens and only has a
different sense from the sense that was assumed and supposed to be valid in each
case. Consciousness experiences both sides as equally essential moments, and in so
doing learns what the nature of the Thing itself is, viz. that it is neither merely a Thing
---
                                                 .                                 

which stands opposed to doing in general and to singular doing, nor doing which
stands opposed to subsistence and would be the free genus of these moments as its
species, but rather an essence, whose Being is the doing of the single individual and of
all individuals, and whose doing is immediately for others, or is a Thing and is only a
Thing as the       doing    of  each   and    everyone; the essence which is the essence of all
essences, the      spiritual essence. Consciousness learns by experience that no one of
these moments is subject, but rather gets dissolved in the                      universal Thing itself; the
moments of the individuality which, one after the other, counted as subject for the
thoughtlessness of this consciousness, coalesce into simple individuality, which, as
this individuality, is no less immediately universal. The Thing itself thereby loses the
relationship of a predicate, and the determinacy of lifeless abstract universality; it is
rather the substance permeated by individuality; it is the subject in which individuality
figures both as itself, or as this individuality, and equally as all individuals; and it is the
universal that is a Being only as this doing of all and each; it is an actuality in the fact
that this consciousness knows it as its own singular actuality and as the actuality of all.
The pure Thing itself is what determined itself above as the category, as the Being that
is I or the I that is Being, but as Thinking, which still distinguishes itself from actual
self-consciousness; but here the moments of actual self-consciousness, insofar as we
call them its content (purpose, doing, and actuality), and also insofar as we call them
its form (Being-for-itself and Being-for-another), are posited as one with the simple
category itself, and the category is thereby at the same time the entire content.1

¶419. The spiritual essence is, in its simple Being, pure consciousness and this self-
consciousness. The originally-determinate nature of the individual has lost its posi-
tive meaning of being in itself the element and the purpose of his activity; it is merely
a sublated moment, and the individual is a                    Self, as universal Self. Conversely, the
formal Thing itself has its filling in the acting individuality differentiating itself within
itself; for the differences of this individuality constitute the content of that universal.
The category is in itself, as the universal of pure consciousness; it is equally for itself,
for the
absolute Being, for that universality is the simple equality-with-itself of Being.1Self of consciousness is equally a moment of the category. The category is
   ¶420. Thus what is the object for consciousness has the significance of being the
true; it is and it counts, in the sense of being and counting in and for itself; it is the
absolute Thing which no longer suffers from the opposition of certainty and its truth,
of the universal and singular, of the purpose and its reality, but the Thing whose
Being-there is the actuality          and the doing of self-consciousness; this Thing itself is
therefore the      ethical substance; the consciousness of it is                ethical consciousness. Its
object likewise counts for consciousness as the true, for consciousness combines self-
consciousness and Being in a unity; it amounts to the absolute, for self-consciousness
can no longer and does not want any longer to go beyond this object, for it is together
with itself in it; it cannot, for this object is all Being and power,—it does not want to, for
it is the Self or the will of this Self. It is the real object within its own self as object, for it
has in it the difference of consciousness; it divides itself into masses which are the
determinate laws of the absolute essence. These masses, however, do not obscure the
concept, for the moments of Being and of pure consciousness and of the Self remain
---
     . (.) 

enclosed within it,—a unity which constitutes the essence of these masses and which,
in this difference, no longer lets these moments come apart from one another.1
   ¶421. These laws or masses of the ethical substance are immediately recognized;
we cannot ask after their origin and justification, nor can we look for anything else,
for anything other than the essence that is                   in  and   for itself   could only be self-
consciousness itself; but self-consciousness is nothing other than this essence, for it
is itself the Being-for-itself of this essence, which is the truth, just because it is as
much the Self of consciousness as it is its in-itself or pure consciousness. 1
   ¶422. Since self-consciousness knows itself as a moment of the Being-for-itself of
this substance, it thus expresses within it the Being-there of the law as follows: sound
reason knows immediately what is right and good. Just as it knows the law immedi-
ately, so too the law is valid for it immediately, and it says immediately: this is right
and good. And it does indeed say:               this; these are     determinate      laws; the law is the
Thing itself replete with significant content.
   ¶423. What is thus given immediately must likewise be taken up and considered
immediately; just as in the case of what sensory certainty immediately announces as
being, we had to see how it was constituted, so here, too, we have to see how the Being
announced by this immediate ethical certainty is constituted, or how the masses of
the ethical substance, that are immediately in being, are constituted. Examples of some
laws of this sort will show us this, and since we take them in the form of declarations of
sound reason with its          knowledge,     we ourselves      do not have       first to introduce the
moment which has to be brought out in them, when they are considered as immediate
ethical laws.1
   ¶424. ‘Everyone ought to speak the truth.’—In this duty as expressed uncondition-
ally, the condition will at once be admitted: if               he knows the truth. The command,
then, will now run:        everyone ought to speak the truth, at all times according to his
information and conviction about it. Sound reason, just this ethical consciousness,
which knows immediately what is right and good, will also explain that this condition
was already so bound up with its universal utterance that this is how it meant that
command. But with this it in fact admits that already, in expressing the command,
it really immediately violates it. It said: everyone ought to speak the truth; but it
meant: he ought to speak according to his information and conviction about it; that
is, what it said was different from what it meant; and to speak otherwise than one
means, amounts to not speaking the truth. The amended untruth or blunder is now
expressed like this: everyone ought to speak the truth according to his knowledge and
conviction of it at the time.—But the              universal necessity, valid        in itself, which the
proposition intended to express, has thereby really been inverted into an utter
contingency. For speaking the truth becomes contingent on whether I am informed
of it and can convince myself of it; and nothing more is said than that true and false
ought to be spoken pell-mell in accordance with the information, opinion, and
conception that someone happens to have of them. This contingency of the content
has universality merely in the form of a proposition in which it is expressed; but as an
ethical proposition it promises a universal and necessary content, and thus contra-
dicts itself by the contingency of the content.—Finally, if the proposition is
amended to: the contingency of information and conviction of the truth                              ought to
be dropped, and the truth ought also to be known, then this would be a command
---
                                                 .                                

which directly contradicts the one we started from. Sound reason was at                                     first
supposed to possess immediately the capacity to speak the truth; now, however, it
is said that it should know the truth, that is, that it does not immediately know how
to speak it.—Looking at this from the side of the content, then the content has
dropped out in the demand that one should know the truth; for the demand relates
to knowing in general: one ought to know; what is demanded is, therefore, really
what is free of all determinate content. But here the issue was about a determinate
content, a distinction in the ethical substance. Yet this immediate determination of
the substance is a content which showed itself to be a complete contingency instead
and which, when elevated to universality and necessity by announcing knowledge as
the law, in fact vanishes.1
    ¶425. Another celebrated command is: Love thy neighbour as thyself. It is directed
to the singleton in his relationship with singletons and                    affirms the relationship as a
relationship of the singleton to the singleton, or as a relationship of sensibility. Active
love,—for inactive love has no Being and is therefore hardly what is meant,—aims at
removing evil from someone and doing good to him. To this end one has to distinguish
what is bad in him, what is the good fit for the purpose of countering this evil, and what
in general is his well-being; i.e. I must love him with                    understanding; love without
understanding will harm him, perhaps more than hatred. Essential beneficence with
understanding is, however, in its richest and most important shape the universal
intelligent activity of the State,—an activity compared with which the doing of the
singleton, as a singleton, becomes altogether so trifling that it is hardly worth the trouble
of talking about it. The activity of the State is, moreover, of such great power that, if the
singular doing wanted to oppose it, and either to be a downright crime for itself, or out
of love of another to cheat the universal out of the right and the part that it has in it, such
a doing would be altogether useless and inevitably frustrated. The only significance left
for the beneficence that is a sentiment, is that of an entirely single doing, of help in need,
which is as contingent as it is momentary. Chance determines not only the occasion
for it but also whether it is a work at all, whether it is not at once dissolved and even
perverted into evil. Thus this acting for the good of others, which is declared to be
necessary, is constituted in such a way that it perhaps can exist, but also perhaps not;
that, if by chance the occasion offers, the action is perhaps a work, is perhaps good, but
also perhaps not. This law, therefore, no more has a universal content than the first one
we considered, and does not express, as it should as an absolute ethical law, something
that is in and for itself. Or such laws stop short at the Ought, but have no actuality; they
are not laws, but merely commands.1
    ¶426. But it is in fact clear from the nature of the Thing itself, that a universal
absolute     content    must be abandoned; for any                determinacy      posited in the simple
substance (and its essence is to be simple) is inadequate to it. The command in its
simple absoluteness itself expresses               immediate ethical Being; the difference that
appears in it is a determinacy, and therefore a content which is subsumed                                under
the absolute universality of this simple Being. Since, then, an absolute content must
be given up, the command can only claim formal universality, or that it is not self-
contradictory, for universality without content is formal universality, and absolute
content is itself tantamount to a difference which is no difference, or to absence
of content.1
---
      . (.) 

    ¶427. All that is left, then, for law-giving is the pure form of universality or, in fact,
the tautology of consciousness which confronts the content, and is a knowledge, not
of a content in being or a proper content, but of the essence or of the equality-to-itself
of this essence.
    ¶428. The ethical essence is thus not itself immediately a content, but only a
standard for deciding whether a content is capable of being a law or not, insofar as it
does not contradict itself. Law-giving reason is demoted to a merely testing reason. 1
.     -
¶429. A difference within the simple ethical substance is for it a contingency, which, in
the determinate command, we saw emerge as contingency of knowledge, of actuality,
and of doing. The comparison of that simple Being with the determinacy that fails to
correspond to it fell within us; and in that comparison the simple substance has shown
itself to be formal universality or pure consciousness, which is free from the content
and confronts it, and is a           knowing      of it as determinate content. In this way this
universality remains the same as what the Thing itself was. But in consciousness it is
something else; it is, namely, no longer the thoughtless, inert genus, but is related to
the particular and counts as its power and truth.—This consciousness seems at first to
be the same process of testing which we were previously, and it seems that its doing
cannot be anything other than what has already happened, a comparison of the
universal with the determinate, from which, as before, their disparity would emerge.
Here, however, the relationship of the content to the universal is different, since the
universal has acquired another significance; it is                  formal    universality, of which the
determinate content is capable, for in that universality the content is considered only
in relation to itself. In our testing, the solid universal substance confronted the
determinacy, which developed itself as a contingency of the consciousness into
which the substance entered. Here, one term of the comparison has vanished; the
universal is no longer the substance that is and counts, or that which is right in and
for itself, but simple knowing or form, which compares a content only with itself,
and considers whether it is a tautology. Laws are no longer given, but tested; and
for the testing consciousness the laws are                 already    given; it takes up their content
simply as it is, without concerning itself, as we did, with the singularity and
contingency inherent in its actuality; it sticks to the command as a command,
and its attitude towards it is just as simple as its being a standard for it.1
    ¶430. But for this reason this testing does not get far; just because the standard is the
tautology, and indifferent to the content, one content is just as acceptable to it as its
opposite.—Suppose the question is whether it ought to be a law in and for itself that
there be property;        in and for itself, not from utility for other purposes; the ethical
essentiality consists just in the fact that the law is equal only to itself, and because of
this equality with itself, thus grounded in its own essence, is not something condi-
tional. Property in and for itself does not contradict itself; it is an isolated determinacy,
or a determinacy posited as equal only to itself. Non-property, ownerlessness of things
or community of goods is just as little self-contradictory. That something belongs to
nobody, or to the first-comer who takes possession of it, or to all together, to each
according to his need or in equal portions—that is a simple determinacy, a formal
thought, like its contrary, property.—Admittedly, if the ownerless thing is considered
---
                                                .                              

as a necessary object of need, then it is necessary that it become the possession of some
singleton; and it would be contradictory to make the freedom of the thing into a
law instead. But by ownerlessness of the thing is not meant an absolute own-
erlessness, but it should become a possession according to the need of the singleton,
and, moreover, not in order to be kept, but to be used immediately. But to provide
for need exclusively according to contingency is contradictory to the nature of the
conscious essence which alone is under discussion; for such an essence must
represent its need to itself in the form of universality, must provide for the whole
of its existence, and acquire a lasting good. Because of this, the thought that a thing
should fall in a contingent way to the lot of the first self-conscious life that comes
along and needs it, did not accord with itself.—In the community of goods, where
needs would be provided for in a universal and constant manner, either each is
allotted as much as he needs; then this inequality and the essence of consciousness,
whose principle is the         equality of singletons, contradict each other. Or, in accord-
ance with the latter principle, the distribution is
relation to the need, the relation that is, however, the very concept of the share.1equal; then the share lacks the
   ¶431. Still, if in this way non-property appears contradictory, this happens only
because it has not been left as a simple determinacy. The same applies to property, if
this is resolved into moments. The single thing that is my property thereby counts as
a  universal, a fixture, a permanency; but this contradicts its nature, which consists
in its being used and in vanishing. At the same time, it counts as what is mine, which
all the others recognize and from which they exclude themselves. The fact, however,
that I am recognized involves rather my equality with everyone, the contrary of
exclusion.—What I possess is a              thing, i.e. a Being for others in general, entirely
universal and undetermined to be only for me; that                       I  possess it, contradicts its
universal thinghood. Consequently, property contradicts itself on all sides just as
much as non-property; each has in it these two opposed, contradictory moments of
singularity and universality.—But each of these determinacies when represented
simply, as property or non-property, without developing them further, is as                           simple
as the other, i.e. is not self-contradictory.—The standard of law, which reason has
within itself, therefore fits every case equally well, and is thus in fact no standard at
all.—It would have to be strange, too, if tautology, the principle of contradiction,
which is admitted to be only a formal criterion for the cognition of theoretical truth,
i.e. something which is quite indifferent to truth and falsehood, were supposed to be
more than this for the cognition of practical truth. 1
   ¶432. In both the moments, just considered, of the                        filling of the previously
empty spiritual essence, the positing of immediate determinacies in the ethical
substance, and then the knowledge whether they are laws, has sublated itself. The
result therefore seems to be this: neither determinate laws nor a knowledge of them
can have any place. But the substance is the consciousness                     of itself as the absolute
essentiality, a consciousness, therefore, which can give up neither the distinction in
the substance nor the           knowledge      of that distinction. That law-giving and law-
testing have proved to be futile, has this significance, that both, when taken singly
and in isolation, are merely unstable moments of the ethical consciousness; and the
movement in which they enter the scene has the formal sense that the ethical
substance thereby presents itself as consciousness.1
---
     . (.) 

    ¶433. Insofar as these two moments are more precise determinations of conscious-
ness of the     Thing itself     they can be regarded as forms of the                 honesty    which, as it
previously did with its formal moments, now busies itself with a supposed content of
the good and the right, and with testing such established truth, and opines that in
sound reason and intelligent insight it has the force and validity of the commands.1
    ¶434. However, without this honesty, the laws do not count as the                              essence    of
consciousness, nor, similarly, does the testing count as a doing                     inside consciousness;
on the contrary, these moments, as they each for itself enter the scene immediately as
an actuality, express in the one case an invalid establishing and Being of actual laws,
and in the other case an equally invalid liberation from them. The law, as a deter-
minate law, has a contingent content,—this has here the significance that it is the law
of a single consciousness concerning a wilful content. That immediate law-giving is
thus the tyrannical insolence which makes wilfulness into a law and ethics into
obedience to such wilfulness,—obedience to laws which are                         merely    laws and not at
the same time commands. So, too, the second moment, insofar as it is isolated, signifies
testing the laws, moving the immovable, and the insolence of a knowledge which
argues itself into freedom from absolute laws, treating them as an alien wilfulness.1
    ¶435. In both forms, these moments are a negative relationship to the substance or
the real spiritual essence; or in them the substance does not as yet have its reality, but
rather consciousness contains the substance still in the form of its own immediacy,
and substance is at first only a willing and knowing of this individual, or the Ought of
a command without actuality and a knowledge of formal universality. But since these
modes sublated themselves, consciousness has returned into the universal and those
oppositions have vanished. The spiritual essence is actual substance through the fact
that these modes are valid, not singly, but only as sublated modes; and the unity in
which they are merely moments is the Self of consciousness which, posited from now
on in the spiritual essence, makes that essence actual, fulfilled, and self-conscious.1
    ¶436. Thus first of all the spiritual essence is for self-consciousness as law that is in
itself; the universality of testing, which was formal universality, not universality that
is  in itself, is sublated. The spiritual essence is equally an eternal law which is
grounded not in the will of this individual, but is in and for itself, the absolute pure
will of all, which has the form of immediate Being. Nor is this will a command, which
only ought to be: it is and it is valid; it is the universal I of the category, the I which is
immediately actuality, and the world is only this actuality. But since this law in being
is purely and simply valid, the obedience of self-consciousness is not service to a
master whose orders are a wilfulness, and in which it does not recognize itself. On the
contrary, the laws are thoughts of its own absolute consciousness, thoughts which it
itself immediately has. Also, it does not believe in them, for although faith does intuit
the essence too, it intuits it as an alien essence. Ethical                 self-consciousness is imme-
diately   one with the essence through the               universality of its      Self; faith, by contrast,
starts from the        singular    consciousness, it is the movement of that consciousness
always approaching this unity, without ever reaching the presence of its own
essence.—The absolute consciousness, by contrast, has sublated itself as singular
consciousness, this mediation is accomplished, and only through its accomplish-
ment, is this consciousness immediate self-consciousness of the ethical substance.1

     ¶437. The difference between self-consciousness and the essence is therefore
perfectly transparent. Because of this, the                 differences in the essence         itself are not
contingent determinacies; on the contrary, in virtue of the unity of the essence and
self-consciousness (and it is only from self-consciousness that inequality could arise),
the differences are the masses into which the unity articulates itself and permeates
them with its life, undivided spirits transparent to themselves, stainless celestial shapes
that preserve in their differences the undefiled innocence and harmony of their
essence.—Self-consciousness is equally a simple, clear relationship to them. They are,
and nothing more,—this is what constitutes the consciousness of its relationship to
them. Thus, Sophocles’s Antigone acknowledges them as the unwritten and infallible
Law of the gods:
                          Its life is not of yesterday or today, but everlasting,
                          And no one knows at what time it appeared.1
They are. If I inquire after their origin and confine them to the point of their source,
then I have gone beyond them; for now it is I who am the universal, while they are the
conditioned and limited. If they are supposed to prove their validity to my insight,
then I have already set in motion their unshakeable Being-in-itself, and regard them
as something which, for me, is perhaps true, but also is perhaps not true. The ethical
disposition consists just in sticking steadfastly to what is right, and abstaining from
all attempts to move it, to shake it, or to reduce it.—If something has been deposited
with me, it is the property of someone else and I acknowledge it because it is so, and
I keep myself unfalteringly in this relationship. If I should retain the deposit for
myself, then according to the principle of my testing, the tautology, I commit no
contradiction whatsoever; for then I no longer look upon it as the property of
someone else; to retain something which I do not regard as belonging to someone
else is perfectly consistent. Alteration of the point of view is no contradiction; for what
we are concerned with is not the point of view as such, but the object and content,
which ought not to be self-contradictory. Just as I can—as I do when I give something
away—alter the view that it is my property into the view that it belongs to someone
else, without becoming guilty thereby of a contradiction, so I can equally pursue the
reverse course.—It is not, therefore, because I find something not self-contradictory
that it is right; on the contrary, it is right because it is what is right. That something is
the property of another, this is fundamental; I have not to quibble about it, or hunt
around for or entertain thoughts, connections, considerations of various kinds; I have
to think neither of making laws nor of testing them; by such movements of my
thought I would undermine that relationship, since, if I liked, I could in fact just as
well make the contrary conform to my indeterminate tautological knowledge and
make that the law. But whether this or the opposite determination is the right, that is
determined in and for itself; for myself, I could make whichever of them I liked the
law, and just as well neither of them, and as soon as I start to test them I already tread
an unethical path. It is because the right is for me in and for itself, that I am within the
ethical substance; this substance is thus the essence of self-consciousness; but this self-
consciousness is the actuality and Being-there of the substance, its Self and its will. 2

                (BB.) Spirit

                VI. Spirit
¶438. Reason is spirit when the certainty of being all reality is elevated to the truth,
and it is conscious of itself as its own world, and of the world as itself.—The coming-
to-be of spirit was indicated in the immediately preceding movement in which the
object of consciousness, the pure category, ascended to the concept of reason. In
observing reason, this pure unity of the I and Being, of Being-for-itself and Being-in-
itself, is determined as the in-itself or as Being, and the consciousness of reason finds
this unity. But the truth of observation is rather the sublation of this immediate
instinct of finding, the sublation of this unconscious Being-there of this truth. The
intuited category, the thing found, enters into consciousness as the Being-for-itself of
the I, which now knows itself in the objective essence as the Self. But this determin-
ation of the category, as Being-for-self opposed to Being-in-itself, is equally one-sided
and a self-sublating moment. The category is therefore determined for consciousness
as it is in its universal truth, as essence that is                                                                             in- and for-itself. This still abstract
determination, which constitutes the Thing itself, is at first the spiritual essence, and
the consciousness of this essence is a formal knowing of it, which busies itself with
all sorts of content of the essence; in fact this consciousness, as a singularity, is still
distinct from substance, and either makes wilful laws or opines that in its knowing
as such it has the laws as they are in and for themselves; and regards itself as the
power sitting in judgement on them.—Or, looked at from the side of substance, this is
spiritual essence that is in and for itself, but which is not yet consciousness                                                                                               of itself.
But the essence that
consciousness and represents itself to itself, this is spirit. 1is in   and          for itself, and which is at the same time actual as
      ¶439. Its spiritual essence has already been designated as the ethical substance; but
spirit is the                    ethical actuality. Spirit is the Self of the actual consciousness which it
confronts, or rather which confronts itself as an objective actual world, but a world
that has, for the Self, entirely lost the significance of something alien, just as the Self
has entirely lost the significance of a Being-for-itself separated from the world,
whether dependent on it or not. Spirit is the substance and the universal, permanent
essence equal-to-itself,—it is the unshakeable and indissoluble ground and starting-
point for the doing of everyone,—and it is their purpose and goal, as the in-itself, in
thought, of all self-consciousnesses.—This substance is equally the universal                                                                                                         work
that generates itself through the doing of all and everyone as their unity and equality,
for it is the                     Being-for-itself, the Self, the doing. As                                                                substance, spirit is unwavering
righteous                  equality-with-itself; but as                                            Being-for-itself                         it is the dissolved essence, the
self-sacrificing benevolent essence, in which everyone accomplishes his own work,
---
                                                                                          .         

tears asunder the universal Being, and takes from it his share. This dissolution and
singularization of the essence is precisely the moment of the doing and Self of
everyone; it is the movement and soul of substance and the actuated universal
essence. Just because it is Being dissolved in the Self, it is not the dead essence, but
is actual and alive. 1
    ¶440. Spirit is thus the self-supporting, absolute, real essence. All previous shapes
of consciousness are abstractions from it; what they are is this: spirit analyses itself,
differentiates its moments, and dwells on single moments. This isolating of such
moments has spirit itself as its presupposition                  and its   subsistence, or the isolation
exists only in spirit, which is existence. In this isolation they have the semblance of
being as such; but that they are only moments or vanishing quantities is shown by
their push forwards and their return into their ground and essence; and this essence
is just this movement and dissolution of these moments. Here, where spirit, or the
reflection of these moments into themselves, is posited, we may briefly recall this
aspect in our own reflection on them; they were consciousness, self-consciousness,
and reason. Spirit, then, is consciousness in general, which comprehends within itself
sensory certainty, perception, and the understanding, insofar as in its self-analysis
spirit holds fast to the moment of being an objective actuality to itself, and abstracts
from the fact that this actuality is its own Being-for-itself. If, on the contrary, it holds
fast to the other moment of the analysis, that its object is its own Being-for-itself, then
it is self-consciousness. But as immediate consciousness of the Being-in-and-for-itself,
as unity of consciousness and self-consciousness, spirit is consciousness that                              has
reason; it is consciousness which, as the word ‘has’ indicates, has the object as in itself
rationally determined or determined by the value of the category, but in such a way
that the object does not as yet have for the consciousness of it the value of the
category. Spirit is the consciousness which we were considering just now. When this
reason, which spirit has, is finally intuited by spirit as the sort of reason that is, or as
reason that is actual in spirit and is its world, then spirit is in its truth; it is spirit, it is
the actual ethical essence. 1
    ¶441. Spirit is the ethical life of a people insofar as spirit is the immediate truth; the
individual that is a world. Spirit must advance to the consciousness of what it
immediately is, must sublate the beautiful ethical life, and by way of a series of shapes
attain to knowledge of itself. These shapes, however, are differentiated from the
previous ones by the fact that they are the real spirits, proper actualities, and instead
of shapes merely of consciousness, are shapes of a world.1
    ¶442. The      living ethical     world is spirit in its       truth; when spirit         first arrives at
abstract     knowledge      of its essence, the ethical order is submerged in the formal
universality of right. Spirit, henceforth divided within itself, inscribes one of its
worlds, the realm of culture, in the harsh actuality of its objective element, and over
against this realm, it inscribes in the element of thinking the                         world of faith, the
realm of the essence. Both worlds, however, when grasped by spirit—which after
this loss of itself withdraws into itself—when grasped by the                            concept, are con-
founded and revolutionized by                insight    and its dissemination, the           enlightenment,
and the realm divided and expanded into the hither side                          and the     beyond    returns
into self-consciousness, which now, in morality, grasps itself as the essentiality and
grasps the essence as the actual Self; it no longer posits its                      world    and its ground
---
      (.)   

outside itself, but lets everything fade away into itself, and, as conscience, is spirit
certain of itself. 1
    ¶443. The ethical world, the world rent asunder into the hither side and the
beyond, and the moral world-view, are thus the spirits whose movement and return
into the simple Self of spirit, a Self that is for itself, will develop, and as their goal and
result the actual self-consciousness of absolute spirit will arise.1
A. The true spirit, the ethical order
¶444. Spirit is, in its simple truth, consciousness, and prises its moments apart from
each other. Action         separates spirit into substance and consciousness of substance;
and separates the substance as well as consciousness. Substance, as universal essence
and purpose, confronts itself as the singularized actuality; the infinite middle term is
self-consciousness which, in itself unity of itself and the substance, now becomes it for
itself  and unites the universal essence and its singularized actuality; it raises the
actuality to the essence and acts ethically,—and it lowers the essence to the actuality,
and carries out the purpose, the substance merely in thought; it produces the unity of
its Self and the substance as its own work, and thus as actuality. 1
    ¶445. In this dispersion of consciousness, the simple substance has, on the one
hand, maintained opposition to self-consciousness, and on the other hand it thereby
equally presents within its own self the nature of consciousness, viz. to differentiate
itself within itself, as a world articulated into its masses. Substance thus splits up into
a differentiated ethical essence, into a human and a divine law. Similarly, the self-
consciousness confronting the substance assigns itself, according to its essence, to
one of these powers and, as knowledge, splits up into ignorance of what it does, and
knowledge of what it does, a knowledge which for that reason is a deceptive knowledge.
In its deed it thus experiences the contradiction of those powers into which the
substance divided itself and their mutual destruction, as well as the contradiction
between its knowledge of the ethical character of its action, and what is ethical in
and for itself, and thus meets its own downfall. In fact, however, through this move-
ment the ethical substance has become actual self-consciousness, or this Self has come to
be in and for itself; but in the process the ethical order itself has gone to ruin.1

¶446. The simple substance of spirit divides itself as consciousness. Or, just as
the consciousness of abstract Being, of sensory Being, passes over into perception,
so too does the immediate certainty of real ethical Being; and just as for sense-
perception simple Being becomes a thing of many properties, so for ethical percep-
tion the case of action is an actuality with many ethical relations. For the former,
however, the useless multiplicity of properties concentrates itself into the essential
opposition of singularity and universality; and still more for ethical perception, which
is the purified substantial consciousness, the multiplicity of ethical moments becomes
the duality of a law of singularity and a law of universality. But each of these masses
of substance remains spirit in its entirety; if in sense-perception things have no
other substance than the two determinations of singularity and universality, here
these determinations express only the superficial opposition of the two sides towards
each other.1

                                                                                          .         

   ¶447. In the essence we are considering here, singularity has the significance of self-
consciousness in general, not of a singular contingent consciousness. In this deter-
mination, therefore, the ethical substance is                  actual   substance, the absolute spirit
realized in the multiplicity of consciousness that is-there; this spirit is the essence of
the commonwealth which, when we entered the practical configuration of reason in
general, was for us the absolute essence, and here has emerged for itself in its truth as
conscious ethical essence, and as the essence for the consciousness which is here our
object. The commonwealth is spirit which is for itself                     in that it maintains itself in
the  counterglow of individuals,—and it is in itself                or substance, in that it maintains
them within itself. As the actual substance it is a people, and as actual consciousness
a citizen of that people. This consciousness has its essence in the simple spirit, and the
certainty of itself in the actuality of this spirit, in the people as a whole, and immediately
therein it has its truth, thus not in something that is not actual, but in a spirit that exists
and prevails.1
   ¶448. This spirit can be called the human law, because it is essentially in the form
of actuality conscious of itself. In the form of universality it is the well-known law, and
the prevailing custom; in the form of singularity it is the actual certainty of itself in
the  individual     in general, and the certainty of itself as              simple individuality        is that
spirit as government; its truth is its manifest validity, exposed to the light of day; an
existence which for immediate certainty assumes the form of Being-there set free. 1
   ¶449. Confronting this ethical power and manifestability there is, however, another
power, the divine law. For the ethical State-power, as the movement of conscious doing,
has its opposite in the        simple    and immediate essence           of the ethical order; as        actual
universality    State-power is a counterweight to individual Being-for-itself; and as
actuality in general it still has in the inner essence something other than what it is itself. 1
   ¶450. It has already been mentioned that each of the opposite ways in which the
ethical substance exists contains the entire substance, and all the moments of its
content. If, then, the commonwealth is substance as actual doing conscious of itself,
the other side has the form of immediate substance or substance that simply is. The
latter is thus on the one hand the inner concept or the universal possibility of the
ethical order in general, but on the other hand equally has within it the moment of
self-consciousness. This moment, expressing the ethical order in this element of
immediacy or of Being, or an immediate consciousness of itself, both as essence and
as this Self in an other, i.e. as a natural ethical              commonwealth,—this is the family.
The family, as the          unconscious, still inner concept, stands opposed to its self-
conscious actuality; as the          element     of the people’s actuality, it stands opposed to
the people itself; as immediate ethical Being, it stands over against the ethical order
that forms and maintains itself by
opposed to the universal spirit.1                 labour     for the universal;—the Penates stand
   ¶451. However, although the                ethical Being      of the family determines itself as
immediate      Being, it is within itself an          ethical   essence, but not       insofar as     it is the
natural    relationship of its members, or insofar as their relation is an                         immediate
relation of actual single members; for the ethical element is in itself universal, and this
relationship of nature is essentially just as much a spirit, and is ethical only as
spiritual essence. We have to see what its peculiar ethical character consists in.—In
the  first place, because the ethical element is in itself universal, the ethical relation
---
     (.)   

between family members is not the relation of sensibility, or the relation of love. It
seems, then, that the ethical element must be placed in the relationship of the single
family member to the whole family as the substance; so that his doing and actuality
has only the family as its purpose and content. But the conscious purpose which the
doing    of this whole has, insofar as this purpose concerns the whole, is itself the
singularity. The acquisition and maintenance of power and wealth is in part con-
cerned only with need and pertains to desire; in part, they become in their higher
determination something only intermediate. This determination does not fall
within the family itself, but bears on what is genuinely universal, the common-
wealth; it is, rather, negative with regard to the family, and consists in extracting the
singular from the family, subduing his naturalness and singularity, and training him
to virtue, to life in and for the universal. The positive purpose peculiar to the family
is the singular as such. Now for this relation to be ethical, neither he who acts, nor
he to whom the action relates, can present himself according to a contingency, as
happens, say, in rendering some assistance or service. The content of the ethical
action must be substantial or whole and universal; therefore it can only be related
to the    whole     singular or to him as universal. And this, again, must not be
understood as if it were only            represented      that a   service   would promote his total
happiness, whereas the service, as it is an immediate and actual action, produces
only a single effect on him;—nor that the service, as education, in a series of efforts,
actually has him in his entirety as its object, and produces him as a work; for apart
from the negative purpose with regard to the family, the actual action has only a
limited content;—just as little, finally, should the service be represented as a help in
need by which in truth the singular in his entirety is rescued; for such help is itself a
completely contingent deed, the occasion of which is an ordinary actuality which
can either be or not be. The action, then, which embraces the entire existence of the
blood-relative, does not concern him as a citizen, for the citizen does not belong
to the family, nor does it concern him as one who is supposed to become a citizen
and to cease to count as this singularity; it has as its object and content this single
family member, as a            universal    essence released from his sensory, i.e. singular,
actuality, it no longer concerns the                living, but the       dead, who, after the long
succession of dispersed Being-there, has concentrated himself into a complete
configuration, and has raised himself out of the unrest of contingent life into the
calm of simple universality.—Because he is actual and substantial only as a citizen,
the singleton, so far as he is not a citizen and belongs to the family, is only the
unactual marrowless shadow. 1
   ¶452. This universality to which the singleton as such attains is pure Being, death;
it is immediate, natural having-become, not the doing                     of a  consciousness. For this
reason, the duty of the family member is to add this side, so that his ultimate Being
too, this   universal    Being, shall not belong solely to nature and remain something
irrational, but shall be something done, and the right of consciousness be asserted in
it. Or rather, the sense of the action is that because in truth the calm and universality
of an essence conscious of itself do not belong to nature, the semblance of such a
doing, a semblance that nature has arrogated, shall fall away, and the truth be
established.—What nature did in him is that aspect in which his becoming a
universal displays itself as the movement of a being. This movement falls, of course,
---
                                                                                         .         

within the ethical commonwealth, and has this for its purpose; death is the fulfilment
and the supreme labour which the individual as such undertakes for the common-
wealth. But insofar as he is essentially singular, it is contingent that his death was
immediately connected with his labour for the universal and was a result of it; on the
one hand, if his death was such a result, it is the natural negativity and the movement
of the singular as a        being, in which consciousness does not return into itself and
become self-consciousness; or since the movement of the                         being    is such that it is
sublated and attains to Being-for-itself, death is the side of bifurcation in which the
attained Being-for-itself is something other than the being which entered into the
movement.—Because the ethical order is spirit in its immediate truth, the sides into
which spirit’s consciousness separates also fall into this form of                        immediacy, and
singularity passes over into this              abstract    negativity which, without consolation
and reconciliation        in its own self, must receive them essentially               through an       actual
and    external action.—And so blood-relationship completes the abstract natural
movement by adding the movement of consciousness, interrupting the work of
nature, and rescuing the blood-relative from destruction, or better, because destruc-
tion, its becoming pure Being, is necessary, by taking on itself the deed of destruction.
Through this it comes about that even the dead Being, the universal Being, becomes
something that has returned into itself, a Being-for-itself, or the pure singular singu-
larity, lacking any force, is raised to universal individuality. The dead, since he has
liberated his Being from his doing or the negative unit, is empty singularity, merely a
passive Being for another, at the mercy of all lowly irrational individuality and the
forces of abstract materials, all of which are now more powerful than himself, the
former on account of the life it possesses, the latter on account of their negative nature.
The family keeps away from the dead this dishonouring doing of unconscious desire
and abstract essences, and puts its own doing in its place, and weds the relative to the
bosom of the earth, to the elemental imperishable individuality; the family thereby
makes him the companion of a commonwealth which overpowers and keeps under
control the forces of singular materials and the lowly vitalities, which sought to unloose
themselves against him and to destroy him.1
    ¶453. This last duty thus constitutes the perfect divine law, or the positive ethical
action towards the singleton. Every other relationship to him which does not remain
at the level of love but is ethical, belongs to human law and has the negative
significance of raising the singleton above confinement in the natural commonwealth
to which he, as actual, belongs. But now although human right has for its content and
power the actual ethical substance conscious of itself, the entire people, while the
divine right and law has for its content and power the singleton who is beyond
actuality, yet he is not without power; his power is the abstract, pure universal, the
elemental individual which, just as it is the ground of the individuality, draws it back
into the pure abstraction, as into its essence, when this individuality breaks loose
from the element and constitutes the self-conscious actuality of the people.—How
this power presents itself in the people itself, will be developed further.1
    ¶454. Now, in the one law as in the other there are also differences and gradations.
For since both essences have in them the moment of consciousness, difference unfolds
within themselves; and this constitutes their movement and peculiar life. Consideration
of these differences shows the mode of operation and the mode of self-consciousness
---
     (.)    

of the two      universal essences       of the ethical world, and also their               connection     and
transition into one another.1
    ¶455. The commonwealth, the higher law whose validity manifests itself in the light
of day, has its actual vitality in the government                as that in which it is an individual.
Government is the actual spirit reflected into itself, the simple Self of the entire ethical
substance. This simple power does indeed allow the essence to expand into its
articulation, and to give to each part subsistence and a Being-for-itself of its own.
Spirit has in this its      reality   or its Being-there, and the family is the element                 of this
reality. But spirit is at the same time the force of the whole, which brings these parts
together again into a negative unit, gives them the feeling of dependence, and keeps
them in the consciousness of having their life only in the whole. So the common-
wealth may, on the one hand, organize itself into systems of personal independence
and of property, of right concerning persons and right concerning things; likewise it
may articulate into associations of their own, and allow independence to, the ways of
working for purposes which are in the                  first instance singular—those of gain and
enjoyment. The spirit of universal association is the                      simplicity    and the     negative
essence of these systems that isolate themselves. So that they do not become rooted
and set in this isolation, thereby letting the whole break up and the spirit evaporate,
the government has from time to time to shake them to their core by wars, by this
means to violate and confound their established order and right to independence,
while making the individuals who, absorbed in this order, break loose from the whole
and strive after inviolable Being-for-itself and security of the person, feel in the task
imposed on them their lord and master, death. Spirit, by this dissolution of the form
of subsistence, wards off from ethical Being-there the lapse into natural Being-there,
and it preserves the Self of its consciousness and raises it into freedom and into its
force.—The negative essence shows itself to be the genuine power of the common-
wealth and the force         of its self-preservation; the commonwealth therefore has the
truth and confirmation of its power in the essence of the divine law and in the realm
of the nether world1.
    ¶456. The divine law which reigns in the family has likewise on its side differences
within itself whose relation constitutes the living movement of its actuality. But
among the three relationships, of husband and wife, of parents and children, of
siblings as brother and sister, the relationship of husband and wife is in the first place
the immediate self-cognition of one consciousness in the other, and the cognition of
the mutual recognition. Because this is               natural    self-cognition, and not ethical self-
cognition, it is only a representation, an image of spirit, not the actual spirit itself.—The
representation or the image, however, has its actuality in something other than itself;
this relationship therefore has its actuality not in itself but in the child,—an other,
whose coming-to-be is the relationship, and that in which the relationship itself
vanishes; and this alternation of successive generations has its permanence in the
people.—The piety of husband and wife towards each other is thus mixed with a
natural relation and with sentiment, and their relationship does not have its return
into itself within itself; similarly the second relationship, the piety                     of  parents    and
children towards each other. The piety of parents towards their children is affected
precisely by this emotional impact of having the consciousness of the relationship’s
actuality in the other, and of seeing the Being-for-itself come about in the other,
---
                                                                                         .         

without taking it back again; but it remains an alien actuality of its own;—but the
piety of children towards parents is affected, conversely, by the emotional impact of
having the coming-to-be of itself, or the in-itself, in a vanishing other, and of
attaining Being-for-itself and a self-consciousness of its own only through separation
from the source,—a separation in which the source dries up. 1
    ¶457. Both these relationships are confined within the transition and the inequal-
ity of the sides which are assigned to them.—The unmixed relationship obtains,
however, between brother and sister. They are the same blood which has, however, in
them arrived at its rest and equilibrium. Therefore, they do not desire one another,
nor have they given to, or received from, one another this Being-for-itself; on the
contrary, they are free individualities in regard to each other. Consequently, the
feminine, as sister, has the supreme presentiment of the ethical essence; she does not
attain to consciousness, or to the actuality, of this essence, because the law of the
family is the internal        essence that is-in-itself, an essence which does not lie in the
daylight of consciousness, but remains internal feeling and the divine element
exempt from actuality. The feminine is bound to these Penates and intuits in them
both its universal substance and also its singularity, yet in such a way that this
relation of singularity is at the same time not the natural relation of pleasure.—As
a daughter, the woman must now see her parents vanish with natural emotion and
ethical resignation, for only at the cost of this relationship does she arrive at the
Being-for-self of which she is capable. Thus in the parents, she does not intuit her
Being-for-self in a positive mode.—The relationships of mother and                           wife, however,
involve singularity, partly as something natural pertaining to pleasure, partly as
something negative which discerns in those relationships only their vanishing; and
also, again, the singularity is for that very reason something contingent which can be
replaced by another singularity. In the household of the ethical order, it is not                          this
husband, not this child, but a husband, children in general,—not sensibility, but the
universal, on which these relationships of the woman are based. The difference
between the ethical life of the woman and that of the man consists just in this, that
in her determination for singularity and in her pleasure, she remains immediately
universal and alien to the singularity of desire; whereas in the husband these two
sides are separated, and since he possesses as a citizen the                       self-conscious    force of
universality, he thereby purchases for himself the right of                     desire and, at the same
time, preserves his freedom in regard to desire. Insofar, then, as in this relationship
of the wife there is an admixture of singularity, her ethical character is not pure; but
insofar as her ethical character is pure, the singularity is a matter of indifference, and
the wife lacks the moment of recognizing herself as                       this  Self in the other.—The
brother, however, is for the sister the calm, equal essence in general, her recognition
in him is pure and unmixed with any natural relation; in this relationship, therefore,
the indifference of the singularity, and its ethical contingency, are not present; but the
moment of the singular Self, recognizing and recognized, may here assert its right,
because it is linked to the equilibrium of the blood and to a relation devoid of desire.
The loss of the brother is therefore irreparable to the sister and her duty towards him
is the highest.1
    ¶458. This relationship is at the same time the limit at which the self-contained life
of the family dissolves and goes outside itself. The brother is the side on which spirit
---
     (.)    

of the family becomes individuality which turns towards something else, and passes
over into the consciousness of universality. The brother abandons this                         immediate,
elemental, and therefore, strictly speaking, negative ethical life of the family, in order
to acquire and produce the ethical life that is conscious of itself and actual.
    ¶459. He passes from the divine law, within whose sphere he lived, over to human
law. But the sister becomes, or the wife remains, the head of the household and the
guardian of the divine law. In this way, the two sexes overcome their natural essence
and emerge in their ethical significance, as diversities which share between them the
two differences that the ethical substance assumes. These two                       universal  essences of
the ethical world therefore have their determinate individuality in naturally distinct
self-consciousnesses, because the ethical spirit is the immediate unity of the substance
with self-consciousness;—an immediacy which appears therefore, on the side of
reality and of difference, as the Being-there of a natural difference.—It is that side
which, in the shape of individuality that is real to itself, showed itself in the concept of
the spiritual essence as an           originally determinate nature. This moment loses the
indeterminacy which it still has there, and the contingent diversity of predispositions
and capacities. It is now the determinate opposition of the two sexes whose natur-
alness acquires at the same time the significance of their ethical determination. 1
    ¶460. The difference of the sexes and their ethical content remains, however, in
the unity of the substance, and its movement is just the constant becoming of that
substance. The man is sent out by the spirit of the family into the commonwealth
and finds in this his self-conscious essence; just as the family in this way has in the
commonwealth its universal substance and subsistence, so, conversely, the com-
monwealth has in the family the formal element of its actuality, and in the divine
law its force and authentication. Neither of the two alone is in and for itself; human
law proceeds in its living movement from the divine, the law valid on earth from
that of the nether world, the conscious from the unconscious, mediation from
immediacy, and equally returns whence it came. The power of the nether world, on
the other hand, has its actuality on earth; through consciousness, it becomes Being-
there and activity.1
    ¶461. The universal ethical essences are, then, the substance as universal con-
sciousness, and the substance as singular consciousness; they have the people and the
family for their universal actuality, but the man and the woman for their natural Self
and the activating individuality. In this content of the ethical world we see achieved
those purposes which the previous insubstantial shapes of consciousness set them-
selves; what reason apprehended only as object has become self-consciousness, and
what self-consciousness had only within itself has become present as true actuality.—
What observation knew as something found-already-there, in which the Self had no
part, is here custom found-already-there, but an actuality which is at the same time
deed and work of the one finding it.—The singleton, seeking the pleasure of enjoying
his singularity, finds it in the family, and the necessity in which the pleasure passes
away is his own self-consciousness as a citizen of his people;—or self-consciousness is
this: knowing the law of the heart as the law of all hearts, knowing the consciousness
of the Self as the recognized universal order;—it is virtue, which enjoys the fruits of
its sacrifice, which brings about what it sets out to do, viz. to bring forth the essence
into actual presence, and its enjoyment is this universal life.—Finally, consciousness
---
                                                                                                                 .            

of the Thing itself finds satisfaction in the real substance which contains and pre-
serves in a positive manner the abstract moments of that empty category. The Thing
itself has, in the ethical powers, a genuine content that has taken the place of the
insubstantial commands which sound reason wanted to give and to know;—just as it
thereby has a contentful, intrinsically determinate standard for testing—not the laws,
but what is done.1
     ¶462. The whole is a stable equilibrium of all the parts, and each part is an
indigenous spirit, which does not seek its satisfaction beyond itself but finds it within
itself, because it is itself in this equilibrium with the whole.—This equilibrium can be
living, it is true, only because inequality arises in it and is brought back to equality by
justice. Justice, however, is neither an alien essence situated beyond, nor the actuality
unworthy of the essence, an actuality of mutual malice, treachery, ingratitude, etc.
which would execute the judgement in the manner of thoughtless contingence, as an
uncomprehended connection and an unconscious doing and omission; on the con-
trary, as justice of             human        right, justice which brings back the Being-for-itself that
breaks away from the equilibrium, the independence of classes and individuals, into the
universal, it is the government of the people, the government which is the individuality,
present to itself, of the universal essence and is the proper self-conscious will of all.—
The justice, however, which brings back to equilibrium the universal when it becomes
too powerful over the singleton, is equally the simple spirit of him who has suffered
injustice,—a spirit not split up into the one who has suffered the wrong and an essence
beyond; he himself is the power of the nether world, and it is his Erinys which wreaks
vengeance; for his individuality, his blood, lives on in the household; his substance has
an enduring actuality. The wrong which can be inflicted on the singular in the ethical
realm is simply this, that something purely and simply happens to him. The power
which inflicts this wrong on the consciousness, which makes him into a mere thing, is
nature, it is the universality not of the commonwealth, but the abstract universality of
Being; and the singularity, in resolving the wrong suffered, does not turn against the
commonwealth, for it is not at its hands that it has suffered, but against Being. As we
saw, the consciousness of the blood of the individual resolves this wrong in such a way
that what has
should also be something willed and thereby agreeable.1happened becomes instead a work, in order that       Being, the       ultimate,
     ¶463. In this way the ethical realm is in its                               subsistence        an immaculate world, a
world unsullied by any discord. Similarly, its movement is a tranquil transition of one
of its powers into the other, in such a way that each preserves and brings forth the
other. We do indeed see it divide itself into two essences and their actuality; but their
opposition is rather the authentication of one through the other, and where they
come immediately into contact with each other, as actual, their middle term and
element is their immediate interpenetration. The one extreme, the universal con-
scious spirit, becomes, through the individuality of the man, joined together with its
other extreme, its force and its element, with unconscious spirit. On the other hand,
the divine law has its individualization, or the unconscious spirit of the singleton has
its Being-there, in the woman, through whom, as the middle term, the unconscious
spirit rises out of its unactuality into actuality, out of the unknowing and unknown
into the conscious realm. The union of the man and the woman constitutes the active
middle term of the whole, and the element which, sundered into these extremes of
---
     (.)   

divine and human law, is equally their immediate unification which makes those first
two syllogisms into one and the same syllogism, and unites into one the opposite
movements: one from actuality down to unactuality,—the downward movement of
human law, which organizes itself into independent members, to the danger and trial
of death,—and the other, the upward movement of the law of the nether world to the
actuality of the light of day and to conscious Being-there. Of these movements, the
former falls to the man, the latter to the woman.1

¶464. But the way in which the opposition is constituted in this ethical realm is such
that self-consciousness has not yet made its entry in its right as singular individuality;
in this realm individuality counts, on the one side, only as universal will, and on the
other side, as blood of the family; this singleton counts only as the unactual shadow.—
As yet no deed        has been committed; but the deed is the                   actual Self.—The deed
disturbs the peaceful organization and movement of the ethical world. What appears
in this world as order and harmony of its two essences, each of which confirms and
completes the other, becomes through the deed a transition of                         opposites    in which
each proves itself to be the nullity, rather than the confirmation, of itself and the
other;—it becomes the negative movement or the eternal necessity of the dreadful
destiny which engulfs in the abyss of its simplicity the divine and the human law alike,
as well as the two self-consciousnesses in which these powers have their Being-
there,—and for us passes over into the absolute Being-for-itself of the purely singular
self-consciousness.1
   ¶465. The ground from which this movement starts, and on which it proceeds, is
the realm of ethical life; but the activity of this movement is self-consciousness. As
ethical consciousness, it is the simple, pure orientation towards the ethical essentiality,
or duty. In it there is no wilfulness and equally no struggle, no indecision, since the
making and the testing of laws has been given up; on the contrary, the ethical
essentiality is for this consciousness what is immediate, unwavering, without contra-
diction. Consequently, we are not faced with the sorry spectacle of a collision between
passion and duty, nor with the comedy of a collision between duty and duty,—a
collision which, as regards content, is the same as that between passion and duty; for
passion is equally capable of being represented as a duty, because when consciousness
withdraws into itself out of the immediate substantial essentiality of duty, duty
becomes the formal universal into which every content                      fits equally well, just as we
found before. But the collision of duties is comic because it expresses a contradiction,
viz. the contradiction of an absolute in opposition: an absolute, and immediately the
nothingness of this so-called absolute or duty.—The ethical consciousness, however,
knows what it has to do, and has decided whether to belong to the divine or the
human law. This immediacy of its decisiveness is a Being-in-itself and therefore has at
the same time the significance of a natural Being, as we have seen; it is nature, not the
contingence of circumstances or choice, that assigns one sex to one law, the other to
the other law,—or conversely, the two ethical powers themselves give themselves
their individual Being-there and actualization in the two sexes.1
   ¶466. Now, because, on the one hand, the ethical order essentially consists in this
immediate      decisiveness, and for that reason only one of the laws is the essence for
---
                                                                                        .         

consciousness, while, on the other hand, the ethical powers are actual in the Self of
consciousness, these powers acquire the significance of excluding                       and   opposing one
another;—in self-consciousness they are for themselves, just as in the ethical realm
they are only in themselves. The ethical consciousness, because it has decided for one
of the powers, is essentially           character; for it the two powers do not have equal
essentiality; for this reason, the opposition appears as an unfortunate                         collision of
duty merely with an          actuality    without right. The ethical consciousness is, as self-
consciousness, in this opposition and as such it at once proceeds to force this
opposed actuality into subjection to the law it belongs to, or else to outwit it. Since
it sees right only on one side and wrong on the other, the consciousness which
belongs to the divine law perceives in the other side contingent human violence; while
the consciousness assigned to human law sees in the other side only the obstinacy
and the disobedience of internal Being-for-itself; for the commands of government
are the universal public sense open to the light of day; the will of the other law,
however, is the sense of the nether world, closed up in the interior, and in its Being-
there it appears as the will of singularity and, in contradiction with the first law, is a
wanton outrage.1
   ¶467. In this way there arises in consciousness the opposition of the known and
the  not-known, just as in substance the opposition of the conscious and the uncon-
scious; and the absolute right of ethical self-consciousness                  comes into conflict with
the divine     right  of the    essence. For self-consciousness, as consciousness, objective
actuality as such has essence; but according to its substance it is the unity of itself
and this opposite, and ethical self-consciousness is the consciousness of the sub-
stance; therefore the object, in its opposition to self-consciousness, has lost entirely
the significance of having essence for itself. Just as the spheres in which the object is
only a    thing   have long since vanished, so too have these spheres in which con-
sciousness establishes something from out of itself and makes a single moment into
the essence. Against such one-sidedness, actuality has a force of its own; it stands in
alliance with the truth against consciousness, and                    first displays to consciousness
what the truth is. The ethical consciousness, however, has imbibed from the cup of
absolute substance forgetfulness of all the one-sidedness of Being-for-itself, of its
purposes and peculiar concepts, and has, therefore, at the same time drowned in
this Stygian water all essentiality of its own and all independent significance of
objective actuality. Its absolute right is, therefore, that when it acts in accordance
with the ethical law, it shall not find in this actualization anything other than simply
the accomplishment of this law itself, and the deed shall manifest nothing other
than ethical doing.—The ethical, as the absolute essence and the absolute power at
the same time, cannot endure any perversion of its content. If it were only absolute
essence    without the power, then it could experience perversion through the indi-
viduality; but the individuality, as ethical consciousness, in giving up one-sided
Being-for-itself, renounced perversion; just as, conversely, mere power would be
perverted by the essence if it were still such a Being-for-itself. On account of this
unity, the individuality is the pure form of the substance that is the content, and the
doing is the transition from thought to actuality merely as the movement of an
opposition devoid of essence whose moments have no particular content diverse
from each other and no essentiality. Consequently, the absolute right of the ethical
---
     (.)   

consciousness is that the deed, the shape of its actuality, shall be nothing other than
what it knows. 1
   ¶468. But the ethical essence has split itself into two laws, and consciousness, as
an undivided stance towards law, is assigned only to one. Just as this                                simple
consciousness insists on the absolute right that to it, as ethical, the essence has
appeared as it is      in itself, so this essence insists on the right of its reality, or on its
being twofold. But at the same time this right of the essence does not stand over
against self-consciousness, as if it were somewhere else, but it is, on the contrary,
self-consciousness’s own essence; it has its Being-there and its power in self-
consciousness alone, and its opposition is the                  deed   of  self-consciousness. For this
latter, just because it is a Self to itself and advances to the deed, raises itself out of
simple immediacy, and itself posits the                bifurcation. By the deed it gives up the
determinacy of ethical life, of being the simple certainty of the immediate truth,
and posits the separation of itself, a separation into itself as the active party, and
the actuality over against it, an actuality which, for it, is negative. By the deed,
therefore, it becomes guilt. For the deed is its doing, and the doing is its ownmost
essence; and the guilt also acquires the significance of                 crime; for as simple, ethical
consciousness, it has sided with one of the laws, but renounced the other and
violated it by its deed.—Guilt is not the indifferent, ambiguous essence, whereby
the deed as      actually   seen in the light of day could, or perhaps could not, be the
doing    of its Self, as if with the doing there could be linked something external
and contingent that did not belong to it, from which aspect, therefore, the doing
would be guiltless. On the contrary, the doing is itself this bifurcation of positing
itself for itself and over against it an alien external actuality; that there is such an
actuality belongs to the doing itself and results from it. Therefore, only non-doing
is guiltless, like the Being of a stone, not even that of a child.—As regards content,
however, the ethical         action    has in it the moment of crime, because it does not
sublate the     natural     allocation of the two laws to the two sexes, but rather, as
undivided      focus on the law, remains within                natural immediacy, and, as doing,
makes this one-sidedness into guilt by seizing on only one of the sides of the
essence, and reacting negatively towards the other, i.e. violating it. The place in the
universal ethical life of guilt and crime, of doing and acting, will receive more
determinate expression later; but this much is immediately evident, that it is not
this singleton who acts and is guilty; for as this Self he is only the unactual shadow,
or he is merely as universal Self, and the individuality is purely the formal moment
of the doing in general, while the content is the laws and customs and, determin-
ately for the singleton, those of his status; he is the substance as genus, which by its
determinacy, becomes indeed a species, though the species remains at the same
time the universal of the genus. Self-consciousness within the people descends
from the universal only as far down as particularity, and not down to the single
individuality which, in its doing, posits an exclusive Self, an actuality negative to
itself; on the contrary, at the basis of its action lies secure confidence in the whole,
unmixed with anything alien, with any fear or enmity.1
   ¶469. Ethical self-consciousness now experiences in its deed the developed nature
of its  actual course of action, as much when it submitted to divine law as when it
submitted to human law. The law that is manifest to it is linked in the essence with
---
                                                                                           .         

the opposed law; the essence is the unity of both; but the deed has only carried out
one law against the other. But since the two laws are linked in the essence, the
fulfilment of the one evokes the other and calls it forth as a violated and now hostile
vengeance-seeking essence, into which the deed transformed it. To the action, only
one side of the overall decision is clearly manifest; but the decision is in itself the
negative which confronts the decision with something else, with something alien to
the decision that is knowledge. Actuality therefore keeps concealed within it the other
side which is alien to this knowledge, and does not reveal itself to consciousness as
it is in and for itself,—not to the son the father in his offender whom he slays,—not
the mother in the queen whom he makes his wife.1                          In this way, the ethical self-
consciousness is beleaguered by a light-shunning power which breaks forth only after
the deed has happened, and catches it in the act; for the accomplished deed is the
sublated opposition between the knowing Self and the actuality confronting it. The
agent cannot deny the crime and his guilt;—the deed is this: to move what is unmoved,
and to bring forth what was at first only locked up in possibility, and hence to link
the unconscious to the conscious, the non-being to Being. In this truth, therefore, the
deed steps out into the sunlight,—as something in which the conscious is bound up
with the unconscious, what is one’s own with what is alien, as the divided essence,
whose other side consciousness experiences, and also experiences as its own, but as
the power it has violated and roused to hostility.2
     ¶470. It can be that the right which lay in ambush is not present in its own proper
shape for the acting consciousness, but is present only in itself in the inner guilt of the
decision and the acting. But the ethical consciousness is more complete, its guilt more
pure, if it knows beforehand the law and the power it confronts, if it takes them to be
violence and wrong, to be an ethical contingency, and, like Antigone, knowingly
commits the crime. The accomplished deed reverses its view; the very accomplishment
declares that what is         ethical   must be     actual; for the actuality        of the purpose is the
purpose of acting. Acting immediately declares the unity of actuality and substance,
it declares that actuality is not contingent for the essence, but that, in union with the
essence, it is not granted to any right that is not true right. The ethical consciousness
must, on account of this actuality and on account of its doing, recognize its opposite
as its own actuality, must recognize its guilt;
                           Because we suffer we acknowledge we have erred.1
¶471. This recognition expresses the sublated discord between the ethical purpose
and    actuality, it expresses the return to an ethical                 disposition, which knows that
nothing counts except what is right. But the agent thereby surrenders its character
and the actuality of its Self, and has gone to ruin. Its Being consists in its belonging to
his ethical law, as its substance; but in the recognition of the opposite, this law has
ceased to be substance for it; and instead of its actuality it has attained unactuality,
the disposition.—The substance does appear, it is true,                        in  the individuality as its
pathos, and the individuality appears as that which animates the substance and hence
stands above it; but the substance is a pathos that is at the same time its character; the
ethical individuality is immediately and in itself one with its universal, it has its
existence in it alone, and is unable to survive the destruction which this ethical power
suffers at the hands of the opposite power.1
---
     (.)    

    ¶472. But along with this, this individuality has the certainty that that individuality
whose pathos is this opposing power suffers no more evil than it has inflicted. The
movement of the ethical powers against each other and of the individualities positing
them into life and action have attained their                   true end     only insofar as both sides
experience the same destruction. For neither power has any advantage over the other
to make it a more essential moment of the substance. The equal essentiality of both
and their indifferent subsistence alongside each other is their selfless Being; in the
deed they are as a Self-essence, but a diverse Self-essence, which contradicts the unity
of the Self, and constitutes their lack of right and necessary destruction. The character
likewise belongs on the one hand, with respect to its pathos or substance, to one of
the individualities only, while on the other hand, on the side of knowing, the one
character like the other is split up into a conscious and an unconscious part; and since
each itself calls forth this opposition and its not-knowing too is, through the deed, its
own work, each posits itself into the guilt that consumes it. The victory of one power
and its character, and the defeat of the other side, would thus be only the part and
the unfinished work which irresistibly advances to the equilibrium of the two. Only
in the equal subjugation of both sides is absolute right accomplished, and the ethical
substance as the negative power which devours both sides, or all-powerful and
righteous destiny, has entered the scene. 1
    ¶473. If both powers are taken according to their determinate content and its
individualization, we are presented with the picture of their conflict in its shaping as,
on its formal side, the conflict of the ethical order and self-consciousness with uncon-
scious nature and a contingency stemming from nature (the latter has a right against
self-consciousness, because self-consciousness is only the true spirit, only in immediate
unity with its substance)1 and, with regard to content, as the clash between divine and
human law.—The youth comes away from the unconscious essence, from the spirit of
the family, and becomes the individuality of the commonwealth; but that he still
belongs to the nature from which he wrenched himself loose is evidenced by the fact
that he emerges in the contingency of two brothers, who with equal right take control
of the commonwealth; the inequality of the earlier and later birth, as a difference of
nature, has no significance           for them     when they enter the ethical essence. But the
government, as the simple soul or the Self of the spirit of the people, does not tolerate
a duality of individuality; and the ethical necessity of this unity is challenged by
nature as the contingence of plurality. These two brothers therefore fall into dispute
and their equal right to the State-power demolishes them both, for they were equally
in the wrong. From the human point of view, the one who has committed the crime is
the one who, not in possession, attacks the commonwealth at the head of which the
other stood; by contrast, the one who knew how to apprehend the other merely as a
singleton, detached from the commonwealth, and banished him in this powerless-
ness, has the right on his side; he has struck only at the individual as such, not the
commonwealth, not at the essence of human right. The commonwealth, attacked and
defended by empty singularity, maintains itself, and the brothers both meet their
mutual destruction at each other’s hands; for individuality, which links the peril of
the whole to       its Being-for-itself, has expelled itself from the commonwealth and
dissolves itself within itself. The commonwealth, however, will honour the one who
was found on its side; on the other hand, the government, the restored simplicity of
---
                                                                                        .        

the Self of the commonwealth, will punish the other, who already proclaimed its
devastation on the walls, by withholding the last honour; he who came to violate the
highest spirit of consciousness, the community, must be stripped of the honour of his
entire completed essence, the honour of the departed spirit.2
   ¶474. But if the universal thus easily knocks off the pure tip of its pyramid and
indeed carries off the victory over the rebellious principle of singularity, the family, it
has thereby merely embarked on a conflict with the divine law, a conflict of spirit
conscious of itself with the unconscious spirit; for the latter is the other essential
power, and is therefore not destroyed, but merely offended, by the former. But it has
only the bloodless shade to help it to             actual implementation in face of the power-
wielding law exposed to the light of day. As the law of weakness and darkness it
therefore at     first succumbs to the law of the daylight and of force, for the former
power counts below, not on earth. But the actuality which has taken away from the
internal element its honour and power has thereby consumed its essence. The
manifest spirit has the root of its force in the nether world; the people’s certainty,
sure of itself and assuring itself, has the truth of its oath, which binds all into one,
solely in the mute and unconscious substance of all, in the waters of forgetfulness.
The accomplishment of the manifest spirit is thereby transformed into the contrary,
and it learns by experience that its supreme right is the supreme wrong, that its
victory is rather its own downfall. The dead, whose right is violated, knows therefore
how to find instruments of its vengeance, which are of an actuality and potency equal
to the power that injures it. These powers are other commonwealths whose altars the
dogs or birds defiled with the corpse, which has not been raised into unconscious
universality by its due restoration to the elemental individual, but has remained
above the earth in the realm of actuality, and now obtains as a force of divine law a
self-conscious actual universality. They rise up in hostility and destroy the common-
wealth which has dishonoured and shattered its force, the piety of the family.1
   ¶475. In this representation, the movement of human and divine law has the
expression of its necessity in individuals in whom the universal appears as a pathos
and the activity of the movement appears as individual doing, which gives a semb-
lance of contingency to the necessity of the movement. But individuality and doing
constitute the principle of singularity in general, a principle which in its pure
universality was called the inner divine law. As a moment of the manifest common-
wealth it has not only that efficacy in the underworld—or, in its Being-there, an
external efficacy, but it has an equally manifest Being-there and movement that
are actual in the actual people. Taken in this form, what was represented as a simple
movement of the individualized pathos acquires another aspect, and the crime
and consequent destruction of the commonwealth acquire the authentic form of
their Being-there.—So human law in its universal Being-there, the commonwealth, in
its overall activation manliness, in its actual activation the government,                       is, moves,
and maintains       itself by consuming into itself the separation of the Penates, or the
independent singularization into families presided over by womankind, and by
keeping them dissolved in the continuity of its                   fluidity. But the family is, at the
same time, in general the element of human law, the universal ground activating the
singular consciousness. Since the commonwealth only gets its subsistence through
the breakdown of domestic happiness and the dissolution of the self-consciousness
---
     (.)   

into universal self-consciousness, it creates for itself in what it suppresses and what
is at the same time essential to it, in womankind in general, its internal enemy.
Womankind—the eternal irony of the commonwealth—changes by intrigue the
universal purpose of the government into a private purpose, transforms its universal
activity into a work of this determinate individual, and perverts the universal
property of the State into a possession and ornament for the family. Womankind
in this way ridicules the earnest wisdom of mature age which, indifferent to
singularity—to pleasure and enjoyment, as well as to actual activity—only thinks of
and cares for the universal; she makes this wisdom an object of derision for the
frivolity of unripe youth and an object of contempt for its enthusiasm; in general, she
elevates the force of youth to what has validity, the force of the son, in whom the
mother has borne her lord, that of the brother, in whom the sister has the man as her
equal, that of the youth, through whom the daughter, withdrawn from her depend-
ence, obtains the enjoyment and dignity of wifehood.—The commonwealth, how-
ever, can only maintain itself by suppressing this spirit of singularity, and, because it
is an essential moment, it all the same creates it and, moreover, creates it by its
repressive attitude towards it as a hostile principle. However, this principle, since it is
merely evil and futile in its separation from the universal purpose, would be quite
ineffectual if the commonwealth itself did not recognize the force of youth, the
manhood which, still immature, stands within singularity, as the force of the whole.
For the commonwealth is a people, it is itself individuality, and essentially is only for
itself in such a way that other individualities are for it, that it excludes them from itself
and knows itself independent of them. The negative side of the commonwealth,
suppressing the singularization of individuals internally, but self-active in an outward
direction, has its weapons in individuality. War is the spirit and the form in which the
essential moment of the ethical substance, the absolute freedom of the ethical                   Self-
essence from all Being-there, is present in its actuality and authentication. While, on
the one hand, war makes the singular systems of property and of personal independ-
ence, as well as of singular personality itself, feel the force of the negative, on the other
hand, this negative essence rises up in war as that which preserves the whole; the
brave youth in whom womankind                   finds her pleasure, the suppressed principle of
corruption, now steps into the limelight and is what counts. Now, it is natural force
and what appears as a contingency of fortune, that decide on the Being-there of the
ethical essence and on the spiritual necessity; because the Being-there of the ethical
essence rests on strength and fortune, it is already decided that it has gone to ruin.—
Just as previously only the Penates went to ruin in the spirit of a people, so now the
living spirits of the peoples go to ruin through their own individuality in a universal
commonwealth, whose simple universality is spiritless and dead, and whose vitality is
the single individual, as singular. The ethical shape of spirit has vanished and another
shape takes its place.1
    ¶476. This downfall of the ethical substance and its passage into another shape is
thus determined by the fact that the ethical consciousness is directed towards the law
in a way that is essentially immediate; this determination of immediacy means that
nature in general enters into the action of ethical life. The actuality of ethical life
simply reveals the contradiction and the germ of corruption that the beautiful
unanimity and tranquil equilibrium of the ethical spirit has precisely in this very
---
                                                                                          .         

tranquillity and beauty; for this immediacy has the contradictory meaning of being
the unconscious tranquillity of nature, and also the self-conscious restless tranquil-
lity of spirit.—On account of this naturalness, this ethical people is, in general, an
individuality determined by nature and therefore limited, and thus finds its sublation
in another individuality. But when this determinacy—which, posited in Being-there,
is limitation, but equally the negative in general and the Self of the individuality,—
vanishes, the life of spirit and this substance, which is conscious of itself in everyone,
is lost. The substance emerges as a formal universality in them, no longer dwelling in
them as a living spirit, but the simple solidity of its individuality has splintered into a
multitude of points.1
.      
¶477. The universal unity into which the living immediate unity of individuality
and substance withdraws is the spiritless commonwealth which has ceased to be the
substance, itself unconscious, of individuals, and in which they now have the value
of Self-essences and substances, in accordance with their singular Being-for-itself.
The universal, split up into the atoms of absolutely many individuals, this dead
spirit is an    equality, in which all count as           each, as persons.—What in the world of
the ethical order was called the hidden divine law, has in fact emerged from its
interior into actuality; in the ethical order the                singleton    counted, and was actual,
only as the universal           blood   of the    family. As      this  singleton, he was the           selfless
departed spirit; but now he has emerged from his unactuality. Because the ethical
substance is only the true spirit, the singleton therefore withdraws into the certainty
of his own self; 1       he is that substance as the            positive   universal, but his actuality
consists in being a negative universal              Self.—We saw the powers and the shapes of
the ethical world sink in the simple necessity of empty destiny. This power of the
ethical world is the substance reflecting itself into its simplicity; but the absolute
essence reflecting into itself, just that necessity of empty destiny, is nothing else but
the I of self-consciousness. 2
    ¶478. This I thereby counts henceforth as the essence that is in and for itself; to be
so recognized is its substantiality; but its substantiality is abstract universality because
its content is this rigid Self, not the Self dissolved in the substance.
    ¶479. Personality, then, has here stepped out of the life of the ethical substance; it
is the independence of consciousness, an independence which has                              actual validity.
The    unactual thought         of such independence, which comes into its own through
renunciation       of   actuality, occurred earlier as            stoical   self-consciousness; just as
this proceeded from lordship and bondage, as the immediate Being-there of                                  self-
consciousness, so personality has proceeded from the immediate spirit, which is the
universal dominant will of all, and equally their service of obedience. What was for
Stoicism the in-itself only in abstraction is now actual world. Stoicism is nothing else
but the consciousness which reduces to its abstract form the principle of the state of
right,1   spiritless independence; by its            flight from     actuality    it attained only to the
thought of independence; it is absolutely for itself, in that it does not attach its essence
to any Being-there, but wants to give up every Being-there and posits its essence
solely in the unity of pure thinking. In the same way, the right of the person is not tied
to a richer or more powerful Being-there of the individual as such, nor again to a
---
     (.)    

universal living spirit, but rather to the pure unit of its abstract actuality, or to that
unit as self-consciousness in general.2
    ¶480. Now, just as the abstract independence of Stoicism exhibited its actualiza-
tion, so too will this latter independence repeat the movement of the first. The former
passes over into the sceptical confusion of consciousness, into a drivel of the negative
which wanders shapeless from one contingency of Being and thought to the other,
dissolves them, admittedly, in absolute independence but no less engenders them
again and is in fact merely the contradiction of the independence and dependence of
consciousness.—The personal independence of                       right  is similarly rather this equal
universal confusion and reciprocal dissolution. For what counts as the absolute
essence is self-consciousness as the pure                empty unit      of the person. In contrast to
this empty universality, substance has the form of fulfilment and of content, and this
content is now entirely liberated and disorderly; for the spirit that subdued it and
held it together in its unity is no longer present.—This empty unit of the person is,
therefore, in its reality a contingent Being-there and essenceless movement and doing
that reaches no stability. Like scepticism, the formalism of right is thus in virtue of its
concept without peculiar content, it                 finds before it a manifold subsistence, its
possession, and, as scepticism did, stamps it with the same abstract universality,
whereby it is called property. But whereas in scepticism the actuality so determined is
called semblance in general and has only a negative value, in right it has a positive
value. That negative value consists in the fact that the actual has the significance of
the Self as thinking, as the universal in itself, while this positive value consists in its
being mine in the signification of the category, as a recognized and actual validity.—
Both are the same abstract universal; the actual content or the determinacy of what
is mine—whether it be an external possession, or also the inner wealth or poverty
of spirit and character—is not contained in this empty form and does not concern
it. The content belongs, therefore, to an                 autonomous power, which is something
other than the formal universal, to a power which is contingence and wilfulness.—
Consciousness of right, therefore, in its actual validity itself, experiences instead the
loss of its reality and its complete unessentiality, and to designate an individual as
a person is an expression of contempt. 1
    ¶481. The free power of the content determines itself in such a way that the
dispersion of the content into the absolute                multiplicity    of personal atoms is, by the
nature of this determinacy, at the same time gathered into one point, alien to them
and likewise spiritless. This point is, on the one hand, like the rigidity of their
personality, purely singular actuality, but in contrast to their empty singularity, it
has at the same time the significance for them of all content, hence of the real essence,
and as against their supposedly absolute, but in itself essenceless actuality it is the
universal power and absolute actuality. In this way, this lord of the world is to himself
the absolute person, at the same time embracing within himself all Being-there, the
person for whose consciousness no higher spirit exists. He is a person, but the solitary
person who stands over against all; these all constitute the authoritative universality
of the person, for the singular as such is true only as a universal multiplicity of
singularity; cut off from this multiplicity, the solitary Self is, in fact, the unactual,
impotent Self.—At the same time it is the consciousness of the content which has
confronted that universal personality. But this content, liberated from its negative
---
                                                                                          .    

power, is the chaos of spiritual powers which, unleashed as elemental essences, move
against each other madly and destructively in a wild debauch; their impotent self-
consciousness is the powerless enclosure and arena of their tumult. In this knowledge
of himself as the totality of all actual powers, this lord of the world is the monstrous
self-consciousness that knows itself as the actual God; but since he is only the formal
Self which is unable to tame those powers, his movement and self-enjoyment are a
similarly monstrous debauch.1
    ¶482. The lord of the world has the actual consciousness of what he is—the
universal power of actuality—in the destructive violence he exercises against the
Self of his subjects, the Self confronting him. For his power is not the unity of spirit in
which persons would recognize their own self-consciousness, they are rather as
persons for themselves and exclude continuity with others from the absolute rigidity
of their atomicity; they are, therefore, in a merely negative relationship, both to one
another and to him who is their relation or continuity. As this continuity, he is the
essence and the content of their formalism, but the content alien to them, and the
hostile essence which rather sublates the very thing that counts for them as their
essence, Being-for-itself empty of content,—and as the continuity of their personal-
ity, he destroys this personality itself. Thus the personality of right rather experiences
its lack of substance, when the alien content asserts its validity in it,—and it asserts its
validity in persons because it is their reality. On the other hand, the destructive
burrowing in this essenceless soil acquires the consciousness of its all-mastery, but
this Self is sheer devastation, therefore just out of itself and rather the abandonment
of its self-consciousness.
    ¶483. Such, then, is the constitution of that side in which self-consciousness is
actual    as absolute essence. But the            consciousness driven back into itself from this
actuality ponders this inessentiality of itself; earlier we saw the stoical independ-
ence of pure thinking pass through scepticism and                       find its truth in the unhappy
consciousness—the truth of what the situation is with its Being-in-and-for-itself. If
this knowledge then appeared merely as the one-sided view of consciousness as
such, here the actual truth of that view has emerged. This truth consists in the fact
that this universal validity of self-consciousness is the reality alienated from it. This
validity    is the universal actuality of the Self, but this actuality is immediately
perversion as well; it is the loss of the essence of the Self.—The actuality of the Self
that was not present in the ethical world has been won by its return into the person;
what was unified in the ethical world now enters the scene developed, but alienated
from itself.1
B. Self-alienated spirit. Culture
¶484. The ethical substance kept the opposition enclosed in its simple consciousness,
and kept this consciousness in immediate unity with its essence. The essence has,
therefore, the simple determinacy of                 Being    for consciousness, which is directed
immediately upon it and whose custom it is; consciousness does not regard itself as
this exclusive Self, nor does substance have the significance of a Being-there excluded
from consciousness, with which consciousness would have to posit its unity only by
the alienation of itself and at the same time produce the substance. But that spirit
whose Self is the absolutely discrete unit has its content confronting it as an equally
---
     (.)   

hard actuality, and here the world has the determinacy of being something external,
the negative of self-consciousness. This world is, however, spiritual essence, it is in
itself the interpenetration of Being and individuality; this its Being-there is the work
of self-consciousness; but equally an immediately present actuality alien to it, an
actuality which has Being of its own and in which it does not recognize itself. This
actuality is the external essence and the free content of right; but this external
actuality, which the lord of the world of right encompasses in himself, is not merely
this elemental essence contingently present for the Self, but it is, on the contrary, the
Self ’s own labour, though not positive labour,—rather its negative labour. It obtains
its Being-there through self-consciousness’s                 own    estrangement and abandonment
of its essence, an abandonment which, in the devastation which prevails in the world
of right, seems to inflict on self-consciousness the external violence of the unchained
elements. These elements for themselves are only pure devastation and the dissol-
ution of themselves; but this dissolution, this negative essence of theirs, is just the
Self; it is their subject, their doing and becoming. But this doing and becoming
whereby the substance becomes actual is the alienation of personality, for the Self that
is valid in and for itself immediately, i.e. without alienation, is without substance and
is the plaything of those raging elements; its substance, therefore, is its very estrange-
ment, and the estrangement is the substance or the spiritual powers ordering
themselves into a world and thereby preserving themselves.1
   ¶485. Substance is in this way spirit, self-conscious unity of the Self and the essence;
but the two have the significance of alienation for each other. Spirit is consciousness
of an objective actuality free for itself; but this consciousness is confronted by the unity
of the Self and the essence, actual consciousness by pure consciousness. On the one
hand, actual self-consciousness, through its estrangement, passes over into the actual
world, and the latter back into actual self-consciousness; but on the other hand, this
same actuality, the person as well as the objectivity, is sublated; they are purely
universal. This alienation of theirs is pure consciousness or the essence. The present
has its opposition immediately in its beyond, which is the thinking of the present and its
being-thought, just as the beyond has its opposition in the here-and-now, which is its
actuality alienated from it.1
    ¶486. Consequently, this spirit builds itself not merely one world, but a world that
is double, divided and opposed.—The world of the ethical spirit is its own present;
and therefore each of its powers is in this unity, and insofar as the two differentiate
themselves, each is in equilibrium with the whole. Nothing has the significance of the
negative of self-consciousness; even the departed spirit is present in the                            blood   of
kinship, in the Self of the family, and the universal power of the government is the
will, the Self of the people. Here, however, what is present signifies only objective
actuality, which has its consciousness beyond; each singular moment as                                  essence
receives this essence, and with it actuality, from an other, and insofar as it is actual,
its essence is something other than its actuality. Nothing has an indwelling spirit
grounded within itself, but everything is outside itself in an alien spirit; the equilib-
rium of the whole is not the unity which remains together with itself, nor its calming
that has returned into itself, but everything rests on the alienation of the opposite.
The whole, therefore, like each single moment, is a self-alienated reality; it falls apart
into a realm in which           self-consciousness       as well as its object is         actual, and into
---
                                                                                          .        

another, the realm of          pure    consciousness which, beyond the                first, does not have
actual presence, but is in faith. Now, just as the ethical world which is separated into
divine and human law and their shapes, and its consciousness which is separated
into knowing and unconsciousness, returns from that dividedness into its destiny,
into the Self as the negative power of this opposition, so these two realms of the self-
alienated spirit will also return into the Self; but if the former was the first, immedi-
ately valid     Self, the single       person, this second realm, which returns out of its
estrangement into itself, will be the              universal Self, the consciousness grasping the
concept, and these spiritual worlds, all of whose moments insist on a fixed actuality
and non-spiritual subsistence of their own, will dissolve in pure insight. This insight,
as the Self     grasping     itself, completes culture; it apprehends nothing but the Self
and everything as the Self, i.e. it comprehends                 everything, obliterates all objectivity
and converts all         Being-in-itself      into a     Being-for-itself. Turned against faith as
the alien realm of the          essence   lying beyond, it is the         enlightenment. In this realm
too, into which the alienated spirit escapes as into the consciousness of a repose equal
to itself, enlightenment completes alienation; it confounds the housekeeping that
the alienated spirit carries out here by introducing the implements of the world of
here-and-now, a world that spirit cannot disclaim as its property, because its
consciousness likewise belongs to it.—In this negative transaction pure insight at
the same time realizes itself and produces its own object, the uncognizable absolute
essence and      utility. Since in this way actuality has lost all substantiality and noth-
ing in it is in itself    any more, not only the realm of faith, but also the realm of the
real world, is overthrown, and this revolution produces                           absolute freedom, and
with this freedom the previously alienated spirit has completely returned into
itself, abandons this land of culture and passes over into another land, the land of
moral consciousness.1

¶487. The world of this spirit breaks up into a twofold world; the first is the world
of actuality or of spirit’s alienation itself; but the other is the world which spirit, rising
above the first, builds itself in the aether of pure consciousness. This second world
is opposed     to that alienation and is, for just that reason, not free from it, but really
only the other form of alienation, which consists precisely in having the conscious-
ness in two kinds of world, and which embraces both. Therefore, it is not the self-
consciousness of the absolute essence as it is                 in  and for itself, not religion, that is
considered here, but faith, so far as this is a flight from the actual world and thus not
in and for itself. This flight from the realm of the present is therefore within its own
self a twofold flight. Pure consciousness is the element into which spirit raises itself,
but it is not only the element of faith, but equally of the concept; consequently, both
together make their entry at the same time, and faith comes into consideration only
in its opposition to the concept.1
a. Culture and its realm of actuality
¶488. The spirit of this world is the spiritual essence permeated by a self-conscious-
ness which knows itself immediately present as                      self-consciousness being for itself,
and knows the         essence    as an actuality confronting it. But the Being-there of this
---
     (.)   

world, as also the actuality of self-consciousness, rests on the movement in which this
self-consciousness estranges itself from its personality, thereby producing its world
and reacting towards it as an alien world, so that it must now get it into its power. But
the renunciation of its Being-for-itself is itself the engendering of actuality, and so by
this renunciation self-consciousness immediately gets actuality in its power.—Or
self-consciousness is only something, it only has reality insofar as it alienates itself;
by so doing, it posits itself as a universal, and this its universality is its validity and
its actuality. This equality with everyone is, therefore, not that equality of right, not
that immediate recognition and validity of self-consciousness simply because it is;
on the contrary, its validity depends on its having made itself conformable to the
universal by the alienating mediation. The spiritless universality of right accepts
into itself every natural mode of character as well as of Being-there, and justifies it.
The universality which is valid here, however, is the universality that has come about
and for that reason it is actual.1
   ¶489. It is therefore through             culture    that the individual here has validity and
actuality. His true       original nature       and substance is the spirit of the              alienation     of
natural Being. This estrangement is, therefore, both the purpose and the Being-there
of the individual; it is at once the means or the transition, both of the substance from
thought into actuality, and, conversely, of the determinate individuality into essenti-
ality. This individuality cultivates itself into what it is in itself, and only by so doing is
it in itself and has actual Being-there; it has as much actuality and power as it has
culture. Although the Self here actually knows itself as This, yet its actuality consists
solely in the sublation of the natural Self; consequently, the originally determinate
nature is reduced to the           unessential     difference of quantity, to a greater or lesser
energy of will. But purpose and content of the will belong solely to the universal
substance itself and can only be a universal; the particularity of a nature, which
becomes purpose and content, is something                      powerless    and    unactual; it is a      kind,
which vainly and ridiculously struggles to get to work; it is the contradiction of giving
to the particular the actuality that is immediately the universal. If, therefore, indi-
viduality is erroneously posited in the particularity of nature and character, then in
the real world no individualities and characters are to be found, but individuals have
an equal Being-there for each other; this supposed individuality is really only the
meant Being-there, which has no permanence in this world, where only that which
estranges itself and, therefore, only the universal, obtains actuality.—That is why
what is meant ranks as what it is, as a kind. Kind is not quite the same as espèce, ‘the
most formidable of all epithets; for it denotes mediocrity and expresses the highest
degree of contempt.’         Kind    and good of its kind are, however, German expressions
which add an air of honesty to this connotation, as if it were not really meant so
badly, or, again, as if in fact it does not yet include in itself the consciousness of what
kind, and what culture and actuality, are.1
   ¶490. What, in relation to the single                 individual, appears as his culture, is the
essential moment of the substance itself, viz. the immediate passage of its universality
from thought into actuality, or the simple soul of the substance whereby the in-itself
is something recognized          and Being-there. The movement of the individuality culti-
vating itself is, therefore, at the same time the coming about of the individuality as the
universal, objective essence, i.e. the coming about of the actual world. Although this
---
                                                                                           .         

world has come about through individuality, it is for self-consciousness something
immediately alienated and has for it the form of immobile actuality. But at the same
time, certain that this world is its substance, self-consciousness sets about getting it
in its power; it gains this power over it through culture, which, looked at from this
aspect, has the appearance of self-consciousness making itself conformable to actual-
ity, and doing so to the extent that the energy of its original character and talent
permits. What appears here as the sway of the individual, under which the substance
comes and is thereby sublated, is the same thing as the actualization of the substance.
For the power of the individual consists in the fact that it makes itself conformable to
that substance, i.e. that it estranges its own Self and thus posits itself as the substance
that is objective. Its culture and its own actuality are, therefore, the actualization of
the substance itself.1
    ¶491. The Self is actual to itself only as sublated Self. Therefore, the Self does not
constitute for it the unity of consciousness of itself and the object; on the contrary, the
object is, to it, the negative of itself.—Thus, by means of the Self as the soul, substance
is fashioned in its moments in such a way that one opposite inspirits the other, each
by its alienation gives the other subsistence and equally receives subsistence from it.
At the same time, each moment has its determinacy as an insuperable validity and a
firm actuality in face of the other. Thinking fixes this difference in the most universal
way by the absolute opposition of good and bad which, shunning each other, cannot
in any way become one and the same. This fixed Being, however, has as its soul the
immediate transition into its opposite; the Being-there is really the inversion of every
determinacy into its opposite, and it is only this alienation that is the essence and
maintenance of the whole. We now have to consider this actualizing movement and
inspiration of the moments; the alienation will alienate itself, and, through this
alienation, the whole will return into its concept.1
    ¶492. We have          first to consider the simple substance itself in the immediate
organization of its moments, which are-there, as yet uninspirited.—Just as nature
arrays itself into the universal elements—among which air is the enduring, purely
universal, transparent essence, while water is the essence that is perpetually sacrificed,
fire  is their    ensouling     unity which divides their simplicity into opposition while
equally it perpetually resolves their opposition, lastly earth is the                      firm knot     of this
structure and the subject of these essences and of their process, is their departure and
their return,—so in the same way the inner                      essence    or the simple spirit of self-
conscious actuality arrays itself into just such universal, but spiritual masses, arrays
itself as a world—into the first mass, the in itself universal spiritual essence, equal to
itself,—into the other mass, the essence that                   is-for-itself, having become           unequal
within itself,     sacrificing   and    surrendering      itself,—and into the third, which as self-
consciousness is the subject and has the force of fire immediately within itself. In the
first essence self-consciousness is conscious of itself as                     Being-in-itself, but in the
second it has the becoming of Being-for-itself                 through the sacrifice of the universal.
Spirit, however, is itself the Being-in-and-for-itself of the whole, which sunders itself
into a substance which endures, and a substance which sacrifices itself, and which
also equally      withdraws       them again into its unity, both as the outburst of                      flame
consuming the substance, and also the abiding shape of that substance.—We see
that these essences correspond to the commonwealth and the family in the ethical
---

world, without, however, possessing the native spirit which they have; on the other
hand, while destiny is alien to this spirit, here self-consciousness is and knows itself
to be the actual power of these essences.1
    ¶493. We have to consider how initially these members are represented within
pure consciousness as           thoughts    or as being-in-themselves, and also how they are
represented in actual consciousness as objective essences.—In that form of simpli-
city, the    first essence, as the       self-equal, immediate, and unchangeable                   essence   of
all consciousnesses, is the          good,—the independent spiritual power of the                    in-itself,
alongside which the movement of consciousness that is-for-itself is only a sideshow.
The other member, by contrast, is the                  passive    spiritual essence or the universal,
insofar as it surrenders itself and lets individuals get in it the consciousness of their
singularity; it is the nugatory essence, the               bad.—This absolute dissolution of the
essence is itself permanent; as the first essence is the foundation, starting-point, and
result of individuals and in it they are purely universal, the second essence, by
contrast, is on the one hand the self-sacrificing Being for another, and on the other
hand, for that very reason, their constant return to themselves as the singular
their perpetual becoming-for-themselves. 1                                                                 and
    ¶494. But these simple thoughts of the good and bad are likewise immediately self-
alienated; they are actual and are in actual consciousness as objective moments. Thus
the   first essence is     State-power, the other is          wealth. As State-power is the simple
substance, so is it the universal work, the absolute Thing itself, in which individuals
find their    essence    expressed, and where their singularity is purely and simply just
consciousness of their         universality; it is also the work and the simple result, from
which the fact that it derives from their                 doing    vanishes; it remains the absolute
foundation and subsistence of all their doing.—This                      simple, ethereal substance of
their life is, in virtue of this determination of their unchangeable equality-with-
themselves,      Being    and, with that, merely           Being for another. It is thus in itself
immediately the opposite of itself,             wealth. Although this is indeed the passive or
the nugatory, it is likewise a universal spiritual essence, equally the                           constantly
becoming result of the labour and the doing of all, just as it is dissolved again in the
enjoyment of all. In enjoyment the individuality does indeed become for itself or as
singular, but this enjoyment itself is the result of the universal doing, just as,
reciprocally, the enjoyment produces the universal labour and the enjoyment of all.
The    actual   has purely and simply the spiritual significance of being immediately
universal. Doubtless, in this moment each singleton opines that he is acting                               self-
interestedly; for it is the moment in which he gets the consciousness of being for
himself, and for that reason does not take it as something spiritual; yet, even when
looked at superficially, it is evident that each in his enjoyment enables all to enjoy,
that in his labour he is working for all as well as for himself and all are working for
him. His Being-for-himself is therefore in itself universal and the self-interest is only
something opined, which cannot get as far as making actual what it opines, viz. to do
something that would not benefit all. 1
    ¶495. In these two spiritual powers, then, self-consciousness recognizes its sub-
stance, content, and purpose; in them it intuits its dual-essence, in one its Being-in-
itself, in the other its Being-for-itself.—But it is at the same time, as spirit, the negative
unity   of their subsistence and of the separation of individuality and the universal,
---
                                                                                          .         

or of actuality and the Self. Dominion and wealth are therefore present for the
individual as objects, i.e. as things from which he knows himself free, and between
which he opines that he can choose, and even choose neither. As this free and pure
consciousness he confronts the essence as something which is merely for him. He
then has the essence as            essence    within himself.—In this pure consciousness the
moments of substance are to him not State-power and wealth, but the thoughts of
good and bad.—But further, self-consciousness is the relation of its pure conscious-
ness to its actual consciousness, of what is thought to the objective essence, it is
essentially judgement.—It has indeed already emerged for the two sides of the actual
essence, through their immediate determinations, which of them is the good and
which the bad; the good is State-power, the bad is wealth. But this                         first judgement
cannot be regarded as a spiritual judgement; for in it one side has been determined
only as the being-in-itself or the positive, the other only as the being-for-itself and the
negative. But as spiritual essences they are each the interpenetration of both
moments, hence not exhausted in those determinations, and the self-consciousness
which relates to these essences is in and for itself; it must therefore be related to each
essence in a twofold manner, whereby their nature, which consists in being self-
alienated determinations, will come to light.1
    ¶496. Now, to self-consciousness that object is good and in itself, in which it finds
itself, while that object is bad in which it finds the contrary of itself; the good is the
likeness of the objective reality to it, while the bad is their                  unlikeness. At the same
time, what for self-consciousness is good and bad, is in itself good and bad; for self-
consciousness is just that in which these two moments of Being-in-itself                                and of
Being-for-it, are the same; it is the actual spirit of the objective essences, and the
judgement is the demonstration in them of its power, a power which makes them into
what they are in themselves. It is not how they are the like or the unlike immediately
in themselves, i.e. not abstract Being-in-itself or Being-for-itself, that is their criterion
and their truth, but what they are in the relation of spirit to them: their likeness or
unlikeness to spirit. Spirit’s relation to the essences, which, initially posited as objects,
become through spirit           the  in-itself, becomes at the same time their                reflection into
themselves, through which they acquire actual spiritual Being, and what their spirit is,
comes to light. But just as their             first immediate determination             differentiates itself
from the relation of spirit to them, so also will the third moment, their own spirit, be
different from the second.—First of all, their second in-itself, which emerges through
the relation of spirit to them, must already turn out otherwise than the immediate in-
itself; for this mediation of spirit rather moves the immediate determinacy and makes
it into something else.1
    ¶497. Accordingly, the consciousness that is in and for itself does indeed now find
in the State-power its simple essence and subsistence in general, but not its individu-
ality as such, it does find there its Being-in-itself, but not its Being-for-itself, rather it
finds therein doing, as singular doing, denied and subdued to obedience. Before this
power, therefore, the individual reflects himself into himself; it is to him the oppress-
ing essence and the bad; for, instead of being the like, it is what is purely and simply
unlike individuality.—Wealth, on the other hand, is the good; it makes for universal
enjoyment, surrenders itself, and procures for everyone the consciousness of their
Self. It is    in itself    universal beneficence; if it refuses some benefit and is not
---
     (.)   

accommodating to every need, this is a contingency, which does not detract from its
universal necessary essence of imparting itself to all singletons and being a thousand-
handed provider.1
    ¶498. These two judgements give the thoughts of good and bad a content which is
the contrary of the one they had for us.—But at first self-consciousness related to its
objects only incompletely, viz. only according to the standard of Being-for-itself. But
consciousness is equally an essence that is-in-itself                   and must likewise make this
aspect the standard, and only when it has done this is the spiritual judgement
complete. According to this aspect, the                State-power      expresses the      essence   of con-
sciousness to it; this power is in part the tranquil law, in part government and
command, which regulates the singular movements of the universal doing; the one
is the simple substance itself, the other is its doing, animating and sustaining itself
and everyone. The individual thus finds therein his ground and essence expressed,
organized, and actuated.—On the other hand, through the enjoyment of wealth, the
individual does not experience his universal essence, but only gets a                             transitory
consciousness and enjoyment of himself as a singularity that is-for-itself and of the
unlikeness to his essence.—The concepts of good and bad thus receive here a content
opposite to what they had before.1
    ¶499. Each of these two ways of judging finds a likeness and an unlikeness; the first
judging consciousness          finds the State-power unlike it, and the enjoyment of wealth
like it; by contrast, the second judging consciousness finds the State-power like it and
the enjoyment of wealth           unlike    it. We have before us a twofold             like-finding    and a
twofold unlike-finding, an opposite relation to the two real essentialities.—We must
assess this diverse judging itself, for which we have to apply the standard set up.
According to this, the like-finding relation of consciousness is the good, the unlike-
finding relation is the bad; and these two modes of relation we are henceforth to hold
fast themselves as        diverse shapes of consciousness. By reacting in a diverse way,
consciousness itself comes under the determination of diversity, as being good or
bad, not according to whether it had for its principle either Being-for-itself                       or pure
Being-in-itself, for both alike are essential moments; the twofold judging considered
above represented the principles separately and therefore contains merely abstract
ways of judging. Actual consciousness has within it both principles, and the differ-
ence falls solely in its essence, viz. in the relation of itself to the real. 1
    ¶500. There are two opposite modes of this relation: one is an attitude to State-
power and wealth as to something                  like, the other as to something             unlike.—The
consciousness of the like-finding relation is                  noble    consciousness. In the public
power it considers what is like it, seeing that in the public power it has its own
simple essence      and its actuation, and it stands towards it in the service of actual
obedience and of inner respect. Similarly, in the case of wealth, it considers that this
procures for it consciousness of its other essential side, that of                      Being-for-itself; it
therefore considers wealth likewise as essence in relation to itself, and recognizes that
source of its enjoyment as a benefactor to whom it lies under an obligation.1
    ¶501. The consciousness of the other relation is, on the contrary, the                                base
consciousness, which clings to the unlikeness to the two essentialities, thus sees in
the sovereign-power a fetter and a suppression of Being-for-itself, and therefore hates
the ruler, obeys only with a secret malice, and is always on the point of rebellion,—in
---
                                                                                         .         

wealth, by which it attains to the enjoyment of its Being-for-itself, it similarly
considers only the unlikeness, viz. with the permanent essence; since through wealth
it comes only to consciousness of singularity and of transitory enjoyment, it loves
wealth, but despises it, and with the vanishing of the enjoyment, of what is in itself
evanescent, it regards its relationship to the rich as also having vanished.1
    ¶502. Now, these relations express, in the                    first instance, the       judgement, the
determination of what the two essences are as objects for consciousness, not as yet
what they are        in  and    for themselves. The reflection which is represented in the
judgement is on the one hand a positing of the one determination as well as the
other only for us, and therefore a like sublation of both, not yet the reflection of them
for consciousness itself. On the other hand, they are only essences immediately, they
have neither become such, nor are they self-consciousnesses within themselves; that
for which they are is not yet their enlivening; they are predicates which are not yet
themselves subjects. On account of this separation, the whole of the spiritual judging
also still falls apart into two consciousnesses, each of which lies under a one-sided
determination.—Now, just as at first the indifference of the two sides of alienation—
one of which was the in-itself of pure consciousness, viz. the determinate thoughts of
good and bad; the other their             Being-there     as State-power and wealth—rose into a
relation between them, into a judgement, so must this external relation rise to inner
unity or, as a relation of thinking, rise to actuality, and the spirit of both shapes of the
judgement must come into view. This happens when the                              judgement       becomes a
syllogism, the mediating movement in which the necessity and middle term of both
sides of the judgement come into view.1
    ¶503. The noble consciousness thus                finds itself, in the judgement, confronting
the State-power in such a way that the latter is, indeed, not yet a Self, but only the
universal substance, of which, however, it is conscious as its essence, as the purpose
and absolute content. With such a positive relation to this substance, it adopts a
negative attitude to its own purposes, to its particular content and Being-there, and
lets them vanish. This consciousness is the heroism of                       service,—the      virtue   which
sacrifices singular Being to the universal, thereby bringing this universal into Being-
there,—the person, who renounces possessions and enjoyment and acts and is actual
for the established power.1
    ¶504. Through this movement the universal becomes joined together with Being-
there in general, just as the consciousness that is-there cultivates itself to essentiality
through this estrangement. What this consciousness alienates itself from in its service
is its consciousness immersed in Being-there; but the Being                        that is alienated from
itself is the in-itself; through this culture, therefore, it wins self-respect and respect in
the eyes of others.—The State-power, however, which was at first only the universal
in thought, the in-itself, becomes through this very movement the universal in being,
actual power. It is actual power only in the actual obedience which it gets through
self-consciousness’s judgement            that the State-power is the essence, and through the
free sacrifice of self-consciousness. This doing, which joins the essence together with
the Self, produces the twofold actuality, itself as that which has true actuality, and the
State-power as the true that is valid.1
    ¶505. Through this alienation, however, the State-power is not yet a self-
consciousness knowing itself as State-power; it is only its law, or its in-itself, that is
---
     (.)   

valid; it has as yet no particular will; for the serving self-consciousness has not as yet
estranged its pure Self and inspirited the State-power with that, but only with its
Being; it has only sacrificed its Being-there               to it, not its     Being-in-itself.—This self-
consciousness counts as one that is conformable to the essence and is recognized on
account of its Being-in-itself. In it the others find their essence actuated, but not their
Being-for-itself,—they         find their thinking or pure consciousness fulfilled, not their
individuality. It therefore possesses validity in their thoughts and enjoys honour. It is
the haughty vassal who is active on behalf of the State-power insofar as the latter is
not a will of its own, but an essential will, and who is valid in his own eyes only in this
honour, only in the essential representation of universal opinion, not in the grateful
representation of individuality, for he has not helped this individuality to its Being-
for-itself. If this self-consciousness were to stand in relationship to the State-power’s
own will, a will that has not yet come about, its language would be advice, imparted
for the universal interest.1
   ¶506. The State-power, therefore, still lacks a will in the face of advice, and the
ability to decide between the diverse opinions about the universal interest. It is not yet
a government, and therefore not yet in truth an actual State-power.—The Being-for-
itself, the will, which as will is not yet sacrificed, is the inner, separated spirit of the
estates, and this, as against its speaking about the universal interest, reserves to itself
its particular interest, and is inclined to make this chatter about the universal interest
a substitute for action. The sacrifice of Being-there, which happens in service, is
indeed complete when it has gone as far as death; but the surmounted danger of
death itself, which one survives, leaves behind a determinate Being-there and hence a
particular For-itself, which makes the advice about the universal interest ambiguous
and suspect and in fact reserves to itself its own opinion and the particular will in
regard to the power of the State. Its conduct is, therefore, unlike with regard to the
power of the State and falls under the determination of the base consciousness, being
always on the point of revolt.1
   ¶507. This contradiction, which Being-for-itself has to sublate, has the form of the
inequality of     Being-for-itself     with regard to the universality of State-power; at the
same time it takes the following form: this estrangement of Being-there, when it is
complete, viz. in death, is an estrangement that simply is, not one that returns into
consciousness,—consciousness does not survive the estrangement, is not in                               and  for
itself, but merely passes over into the unreconciled contrary. Consequently, the true
sacrifice of Being-for-itself is solely that in which it surrenders itself as completely as
in death, yet in this estrangement no less preserves itself; it thereby becomes in
actuality what it is in itself, becomes the identical unity of itself and of itself as the
opposite. Because the departed inner spirit, the Self as such, comes forward and
alienates itself, the State-power is at the same time raised to a Self of its own; just as
without this alienation the acts of honour, the acts of the noble consciousness, and
the counsels of its insight, would retain the ambiguity that would still have that
secluded reserve of particular intention and of self-will.1
   ¶508. But this alienation happens solely in language, which here enters the scene in
its peculiar significance.—In the world of the ethical order                      law   and command,—in
the world of actuality initially counsel, language has the essence as content and is the
form of that content; but here it acquires for its content the form itself, the form
---
                                                                                          .   

which language itself is, and is valid as language; it is the force of speaking as such, a
force that performs what has to be performed. For language is the Being-there of the
pure Self as Self; in it, the singularity of self-consciousness, a singularity that is for
itself, comes as such into existence, so that it is for others. Otherwise the I, as this pure
I, is not there; in every other externalization it is immersed in an actuality and in a
shape from which it can withdraw; it is reflected into itself from its action, as well as
from its physiognomic expression, and such incomplete Being-there, in which there
is always too much and too little, it lets lie lifeless behind. Language, however,
contains it in its purity, it alone expresses I, the I itself. This Being-there of the I is,
as Being-there, an objectivity which has in it the true nature of the I. The I is this I—
but equally the       universal    I; its appearance is equally immediately the estrangement
and the vanishing of this I, and thereby its remaining in its universality. The I that
utters itself is perceived by ear; it is an infection in which it has immediately passed
into unity with those for whom it is there, and is universal self-consciousness.—That
it is perceived by ear implies that its Being-there itself immediately dies away; this its
otherness is taken back into itself; and its Being-there is just this: as a self-conscious
Now, when it is there, not to be there, and through this vanishing to be there. This
vanishing is thus itself immediately its abiding; it is its own knowing of itself, and
its knowing of itself as a Self that has passed over into another Self, that has been
perceived and is universal.1
    ¶509. Spirit obtains this actuality here because the extremes, of which it is the
unity, have just as immediately the determination of being actualities of their own for
themselves. Their unity is decomposed into rigid sides, each of which is for the other
an actual object excluded from it. Consequently, the unity emerges as a middle term,
which is excluded and differentiated from the separated actuality of the sides; it has,
therefore, itself an actual objectivity distinct from its sides and is for them, i.e. it is a
being-there. The spiritual substance enters as such into existence only when it has
gained for its sides the sort of self-consciousnesses that know this pure Self as
immediately valid         actuality, and therein also immediately know that they are such
only through alienating           mediation. Through the knowledge of the pure Self, the
moments are refined into the self-knowing category, and thereby so far refined as to
be moments of spirit; through the knowledge of the mediation, spirit enters into
Being-there as spirituality.—Spirit is thus the middle term which presupposes those
extremes and is engendered by their Being-there,—but equally it is the spiritual
whole bursting forth between them, which divides itself into them and only through
this contact with the whole engenders each of them in its principle.—The fact that
both extremes are already            in themselves       sublated and decomposed produces their
unity, and this is the movement which joins the two together, interchanges their
determinations, and joins them together, and does so indeed in each extreme. This
mediation thus posits the concept of each of the two extremes in its actuality, or it
makes what each is in itself into its spirit. 1
    ¶510. The two extremes, the State-power and the noble consciousness, are split
up by the latter, the State-power into the abstract universal which is obeyed, and
into the will that is-for-itself, which, however, does not yet itself conform to the
universal,—and the noble consciousness into the obedience of the sublated Being-
there, or the Being-in-itself of self-respect and honour, and into the not yet sublated
---
     (.)    

pure Being-for-itself, the will still remaining in reserve. The two moments into
which both sides are purified and which, therefore, are moments of language, are
the   abstract universal, called the universal interest, and the pure Self, which in its
service renounced its consciousness immersed in manifold Being-there. Both are
the same in the concept; for pure Self is just the abstract universal, and consequently
their unity is posited as their middle term. But the                     Self  is at  first actual only in
consciousness, in the one extreme,—while the in-itself is                      first actual in the State-
power, the other extreme; what consciousness lacks is the actual transference to it of
the State-power, not merely as honour,—and what the State-power lacks is its being
obeyed, not merely as the so-called universal interest, but as will, or its being the
deciding Self. The unity of the concept in which the State-power still stands and
into which consciousness has refined itself becomes actual in this mediating move-
ment, whose simple Being-there, as middle term, is language.—However, the unity
does not yet have for its sides two Selves present as Selves; for the State-power is at
first only inspirited into a Self; this language is, therefore, not yet spirit as it
completely knows and expresses itself.1
    ¶511. The noble consciousness, because it is the extreme which is the Self, appears
as the source of the language            by which the sides of the relationship take shape as
ensouled wholes.—The heroism of mute service becomes the heroism of flattery. This
speaking reflection of service constitutes the spiritual self-decomposing middle term
and reflects back into itself not only its own extreme, but also reflects the extreme of
universal power back into this extreme itself, and makes that power, which is at first
in itself, into Being-for-itself and into the singularity of self-consciousness. The result
of this is that the spirit of this power is an                 unlimited monarch;—unlimited: the
language of      flattery raises this power into its refined universality; the moment as
product of language, of Being-there refined to spirit, is a purified equality-to-itself;—a
monarch: language likewise raises             singularity to its peak; what the noble conscious-
ness estranges from itself on this side of the simple spiritual unity is the pure in-itself
of its thinking, its very I. More determinately, language raises the singularity, which
is otherwise only something               opined, into its purity which is-there, by giving
the monarch a name            of his own; for it is in the name alone that the difference                     of
the singleton from all others is not opined, but is made actual by all; in the name, the
singleton counts as a pure singular, no longer only in his own consciousness, but in
the consciousness of all. By his name, then, the monarch is purely and simply
separated off from everyone else, exclusive and solitary; in his name, he is the atom
that can impart nothing of its essence and has no equal.—This name is thus the
reflection-into-itself or the actuality, which the universal power has within its own
self; through the name this power is the                  monarch. Conversely, he,           this singleton,
thereby knows himself, this singleton, as the universal power, knows that the nobles
are not only ready for the service of the State-power, but that they place themselves
round the throne as ornaments, and that to him who sits on it they continually say
what he is. 1
    ¶512. The language of their praise is in this way the spirit that in the State-power
itself joins the two extremes together; it reflects the abstract power into itself and gives
it the moment of the other extreme, the Being-for-itself that wills and decides, and by
so doing gives it self-conscious existence; or this singular, actual self-consciousness
---
                                                                                          .     

thereby attains to the certain knowledge of itself as the power. It is the point of the Self
into which the many points have flowed together through the estrangement of inner
certainty.—Since, however, this spirit of State-power’s own consists in having its
actuality and nourishment in the sacrifice of the doing and the thinking of the noble
consciousness, it is self-alienated independence; the noble consciousness, the extreme
of Being-for-itself, receives back the extreme of                actual universality in return for the
universality of thinking which it estranged from itself; the power of the State has
passed over to the noble consciousness. In the noble consciousness, the State-power is
first genuinely actuated; in the Being-for-itself of the noble consciousness it ceases to
be the inert essence, which it was when it appeared as the extreme of abstract Being-
in-itself.—Considered in itself, State-power reflected into itself, or its having become
spirit, simply means that it has become a moment of self-consciousness, i.e. it is only as
sublated. Consequently, it is now the essence as something whose spirit is to be
sacrificed and surrendered, i.e. it exists as wealth.—State-power does, indeed, at the
same time continue to subsist as an actuality in the face of wealth, into which it is ever
changing in accordance with its concept, but it is an actuality whose concept is just
this movement of passing over, through service and the veneration through which it
comes about, into its contrary, into the estrangement of power. Thus for itself the
peculiar Self that is the will of State-power becomes, through the debasement of the
noble consciousness, a self-estranging universality, a complete singularity and con-
tingency which is at the mercy of every more powerful will; what remains to it of
universally recognized and non-communicable independence is the empty name. 1
    ¶513. While, therefore, the noble consciousness determined itself as that which
related to the universal power in the mode of likeness, the truth of it is rather to
retain, in its service, its own Being-for-itself, and in the proper renunciation of its
personality, to be nevertheless the actual sublation and dismemberment of the
universal substance. Its spirit is the relationship of complete unlikeness, on the one
hand, retaining its will in its honour, while on the other hand, giving up its will, both
alienating itself from its interior and becoming supreme unlikeness with itself, and
thereby subjecting the universal substance to itself and making it completely unlike
itself.—It is clear that, with this, its determinacy, which it had in the judgement                       in
comparison with what was called base consciousness, has vanished, and hereby the
base consciousness has vanished too. The base consciousness has achieved its
purpose, viz. to bring the universal power under Being-for-itself.1
    ¶514. Self-consciousness, thus enriched by the universal power, exists as universal
beneficence, or this power is the wealth which is itself in turn an object for conscious-
ness. For wealth is indeed the universal that is subjugated to consciousness, but this
universal has not yet by this first sublation returned absolutely into the Self.—The
Self has not yet for its object itself as Self, but rather the sublated universal essence.
Since this object has only just come about, the immediate relation of consciousness
to it is posited and so consciousness has not yet exhibited its unlikeness with it; it is
the noble consciousness which preserves its Being-for-itself in the universal which
has become unessential, and therefore recognizes the object and is grateful to the
benefactor.1
    ¶515. Wealth already has within it the moment of Being-for-itself. It is not the
selfless universal of State-power, or the naive inorganic nature of spirit; it is rather
---
     (.)    

State-power as it, through the will, holds its own against him who wants to get it in
his power for his enjoyment. But since wealth has merely the form of essence, this
one-sided Being-for-itself, which is not in itself, but is rather the sublated in-itself, is
the return, essenceless in its enjoyment, of the individual into himself. Wealth itself
therefore needs enlivening; and the movement of its reflection consists in the fact that
wealth, which is only for itself, becomes Being-in-and-for-itself, that though it is the
sublated essence, it becomes an essence; it thus receives within itself a spirit of its
own.—Since the form of this movement has been expounded before, it is sufficient
here to determine its content.1
   ¶516. The noble consciousness, then, is not related here to the object as essence in
general; on the contrary, it is the very Being-for-itself that is something alien to it; it
finds before it its Self as such alienated, as an objective fixed actuality which it has to
receive from another          fixed Being-for-itself. Its object is the Being-for-itself, and so
what is its own; but, because it is an object, it is at the same time immediately an alien
actuality which is a Being-for-itself of its own, a will of its own, i.e. it sees its Self in the
power of an alien will on which it depends to let it have its own Self.1
   ¶517. Self-consciousness can abstract from every singular aspect, and for this reason
it retains, in an obligation pertaining to such an aspect, its recognition and validity-in-
itself  as an essence that is for itself. Here, however, as regards the aspect of its
pure ownmost actuality or its I, it sees itself outside itself and belonging to another,
sees its personality as such dependent on the contingent personality of another, on
the contingence of an instant, on a wilfulness, or some other utterly unimportant
circumstance.—In the state of right, what is in the power of the objective essence
appears as a contingent content from which it is possible to abstract, and the power does
not affect the Self as such; on the contrary, the Self is recognized. Here, however, the Self
sees the certainty of itself, as such, to be completely devoid of essence and the pure
personality to be absolute impersonality. The spirit of its gratitude is, therefore, the
feeling of the most profound abjection as well as of the most profound rebellion. When
the pure I intuits itself outside itself and dismembered, then in this dismemberment
everything that has continuity and universality, everything that is called law, good
and right, has at the same time come apart and gone to ruin; everything in the mode
of likeness is dissolved, for the            purest unlikeness, the absolute inessentiality of the
absolutely essential, the Being-outside-itself of Being-for-itself, are at hand; the pure
I itself is absolutely torn apart.1
   ¶518. Therefore, although this consciousness gets back from wealth the objectivity
of Being-for-itself and sublates it, it is not only, like the preceding reflection, not
completed in accordance with its concept, but is unsatisfied for consciousness itself;
the reflection, in which the Self receives itself as something objective, is the imme-
diate contradiction posited in the pure I itself. As Self, however, it stands at the same
time immediately above this contradiction, it is absolute elasticity, which sublates this
sublatedness of the Self, rejects this rejection, whereby Being-for-itself becomes as
something alien to it and, rebelling against this reception of itself, is for itself in the
reception itself. 1
   ¶519. Since, then, the relationship of this consciousness is linked with this absolute
dismemberment, within its spirit the difference of this consciousness, its being
determined as noble consciousness in contrast to the base consciousness, falls away
---
                                                                                           .        

and both are the same.—The spirit of beneficent wealth can, further, be differentiated
from the spirit of the consciousness receiving the benefit, and has to be considered
particularly.—The spirit of wealth was the essenceless Being-for-itself, the surren-
dered essence. But through its communication it becomes an in-itself; when it has
fulfilled its determination of sacrificing itself, it sublates the singularity of enjoying
only for itself, and as sublated singularity it is                  universality     or  essence.—What it
communicates, what it gives to others, is Being-for-itself. It does not, however, give
up itself as a selfless nature, as the disinterestedly self-surrendering condition of life,
but as a self-conscious essence keeping itself for itself; it is not the inorganic power of
the element that is known by the receiving consciousness as in itself transitory, but is
the power over the Self, the power that knows itself as independent and wilful, and at
the same time knows that what it dispenses is the Self of an other.—Wealth thus
shares its abjection with the client; but arrogance takes the place of rebellion. For on
the one hand, it knows as well as the client, that Being-for-itself is a contingent thing;
but it is itself this contingency in whose power the personality stands. In this
arrogance, which opines that it has, with a meal, acquired an alien I-self and thereby
gained for itself the submission of that other’s innermost essence, it overlooks the
inner rebellion of the other; it overlooks the casting off of all fetters, overlooks this
pure dismemberment in which, since the                       likeness-to-itself    of Being-for-itself has
become purely and simply unlike, all likeness, all subsistence, is torn apart, and
which tears apart the opinion and view-point of the benefactor most of all. It stands
immediately before this innermost abyss, before this bottomless depth, in which all
support and substance have vanished; and in this depth it sees nothing but a common
thing, a play of its caprice, a contingence of its wilfulness; its spirit consists in being
an entirely essenceless opinion, a spirit-forsaken veneer.1
    ¶520. Just as self-consciousness had its language in the face of State-power, or
spirit emerged between these extremes as an actual middle term, so too self-
consciousness has a language in the face of wealth, but still more does its rebellion
have its language. The language that gives wealth the consciousness of its essentiality
and thereby gets it in its power, is likewise the language of flattery, but of ignoble
flattery;—for what it declares as essence, it knows as the surrendered essence, the
essence that is not in itself. The language of flattery, however, as we have already
observed, is spirit that is still one-sided. For its moments are indeed the Self which has
been refined by the culture of service into pure existence, and the Being-in-itself of
power. Yet the pure concept in which the simple Self and the in-itself, the former a
pure I and the latter this pure essence or thinking, are the same,—this unity of the
two sides, between which interaction takes place, is not present in the consciousness
of this language; to this consciousness the object is still the in-itself in opposition to
the Self, or to it the object is not at the same time consciousness’s own Self as such.—
The language of dismemberment is, however, the perfect language and the true
existing spirit of this entire world of culture. This self-consciousness, to which the
rebellion rejecting its rejection pertains, is immediately the absolute likeness-to-itself
in its absolute dismemberment, the pure mediation of pure self-consciousness with
itself. It is the likeness of the identical judgement, in which one and the same
personality is both subject and predicate. But this identical judgement is at the
same time the infinite judgement; for this personality is absolutely divided, and
---
     (.)   

subject and predicate are purely and simply indifferent beings, which have nothing to
do with one another, which have no necessary unity, so much so that each is the
power of a personality of its own. The                Being-for-itself     has its Being-for-itself for its
object as an out-and-out other, and at the same time equally immediately as itself,—
itself as an other, not as if this had another content, but the content is the same Self in
the form of absolute opposition and a completely indifferent Being-there of its
own.—Here, then, there is present the                 spirit  of this real world of culture, a spirit
conscious of itself in its truth and of its concept.1
   ¶521. This spirit is this absolute and universal inversion and alienation of actuality
and of thought; it is pure culture. What is experienced in this world is that neither the
actual essences of power and wealth, nor their determinate concepts, good and bad, or
the consciousness of good and bad, the noble and the base consciousness, have truth;
on the contrary, all these moments become inverted, one into the other, and each is
the contrary of itself.—The universal power, which is the substance, when it attains to
a spirituality of its own through the principle of individuality, receives its own Self
merely as a name on it and is, while it is                actual power, the powerless essence that
sacrifices itself.—But this surrendered, selfless essence, or the Self that has become a
thing, is rather the return of the essence into itself; it is the Being-for-itself that is-for-
itself, the existence of spirit.—The thoughts of these essences, of the good and bad, are
similarly inverted in this movement; what is determined as good, is bad; what is
determined as bad, is good. The consciousness of each one of these moments, the
consciousness assessed as noble and base, are rather in their truth just as much the
reverse of what these determinations are supposed to be, the noble consciousness
base and rejected, just as rejection veers round into the nobility of the most highly
cultivated freedom of self-consciousness.—Considered formally, everything is like-
wise outwardly the reverse of what it is for itself; and, again, it is not in truth what it is
for itself, but something other than it wants to be, Being-for-itself rather the loss of
itself, and self-alienation rather self-preservation.—What we have here, then, is that
all moments execute a universal justice on one another, each just as much alienates
itself in itself, as it enculturates itself into its contrary and in this way inverts it.—True
spirit, however, is just this unity of the absolutely separated extremes and, indeed, it is
just through the free actuality of these selfless extremes that, as their middle term, it
comes to existence. Its Being-there is the universal speaking and the dismembering
judging for which all those moments, which are supposed to count as essences and
as actual members of the whole, dissolve, and which is equally this self-dissolving
play with itself. This judging and speaking is, therefore, what is true and invincible,
while it overwhelms everything; it is this alone that truly matters in this real world.
Every part of his world gets to have its spirit expressed therein, or gets to be talked
about with spirit and to have said of it what it is.—The honest consciousness takes
each moment as an abiding essentiality, and is the uncultivated thoughtlessness of
not knowing that it is equally doing the reverse. The dismembered consciousness,
however, is consciousness of the inversion, and, moreover, of the absolute inversion;
what is dominant in it is the concept, which brings together the thoughts which, to
honesty, lie far apart, and its language is therefore spirited.1
   ¶522. The content of spirit’s talk of and about itself is thus the inversion of all
concepts and realities, the universal deception of itself and others, and the impudence
---
                                                                                          .    

of expressing this deception is for that very reason the greatest truth. This talk is the
extravagance of the musician who ‘heaped up and mixed together thirty arias, Italian,
French, tragic, comic, of every kind of character; now with a deep bass he descended
into hell, then, contracting his throat, he rent the vaults of heaven with a falsetto
tone . . . , frantic and soothed, imperious and mocking, by turns.’—To the tranquil
consciousness which, in its honest way, posits the melody of the good and the true in
the equality of the tones, i.e. in unison, this talk appears as ‘a rigmarole of wisdom
and folly, as a medley of as much skill as banality, of as many correct as false ideas, a
mixture of a complete perversion of sentiment, of perfect infamy, and of entire
frankness and truth. It will be unable to resist entering into all these tones and
running up and down the entire scale of feelings from the profoundest contempt and
rejection to the highest admiration and emotion; but blended with the latter will be a
tinge of ridicule which detracts from their nature’; but the former will have in their
very frankness a strain of reconciliation, will find in their convulsing depths the all-
powerful note which restores spirit to itself.1
   ¶523. If we consider, in contrast with the talk of this self-aware confusion, the talk
of that simple consciousness of the true and the good, then in face of the frank and
conscious eloquence of the spirit of culture, it can only be taciturn; for to the spirit of
culture it can say nothing that it does not itself know and say. If it gets beyond its
monosyllabic talk, then it says the same as the other pronounces, but in doing so also
commits the folly of opining that it is saying something new and different. Its very
syllables, shameful, base, are already this folly, for the other says them about itself. If
this spirit perverts in its talk every monotone, because this self-likeness is only an
abstraction, while in its actuality the perversion is within itself, and if, on the other
hand, the straightforward consciousness takes under its protection the good and
noble, i.e. what keeps its self-likeness in its utterance, in the only way here possible—
that is, the good does not lose its value by being linked or mixed with the bad; for this
is its condition and necessity, herein lies the wisdom of nature,—then this conscious-
ness, while it opined that it was contradicting, has thereby merely condensed the
content of spirit’s talk into a trivial mode which, in making the contrary of the noble
and good into the condition and necessity of the noble and good, thoughtlessly opines
that it is saying something other than that what is called noble and good is in its
essence the reverse of itself, just as, conversely, the bad is the excellent.1
   ¶524. If the simple consciousness compensates for this spiritless thought by the
actuality of the excellent, by adducing the excellent in the example of a fictitious case
or even of a true anecdote, and thus showing that it is no empty name but is at hand,
then it is opposed by the universal actuality of the perverted doing of the whole of the
real world, in which this example thus constitutes only something entirely isolated,
an espèce; and to present the Being-there of the good and noble as a single anecdote,
whether     fictitious or true, is the severest thing that can be said about it.—Finally,
should the simple consciousness demand the dissolution of this whole world of
perversion, then it cannot require of the                individual      his removal from this world,
for Diogenes in his barrel is conditioned by the world, and this demand of the
singleton is just what counts as the bad, viz. to care for himself as a singleton. But if
the demand of this removal is directed at the universal individuality, it cannot have
the meaning that reason should give up again the spiritual, cultivated consciousness
---
     (.)   

it has arrived at, should submerge the expansive wealth of its moments back in the
simplicity of the natural heart, and relapse into the wilderness and proximity of
animal consciousness, a nature which is also called innocence; on the contrary, the
demand for this dissolution can only be directed to the spirit of culture itself, that it
return out of its confusion to itself as spirit, and win a still higher consciousness.1
   ¶525. But in fact, spirit has already accomplished this in itself. Consciousness’s
dismemberment, which is conscious of itself and expresses itself, is the sniggering
over the Being-there, as well as over the confusion of the whole and over itself; the
sniggering is at the same time the fading echo, still audible to itself, of this whole
confusion.—This self-perceiving vanity of all actuality and of every definite concept
is the double reflection of the real world into itself; once in this Self of consciousness
as this Self, and again in the pure universality of consciousness, or in thinking. In the
first case, spirit that has come to itself has directed its gaze into the world of actuality
and still has it as its purpose and immediate content; but, in the other case, its gaze is
in part turned only into itself and negatively towards the world of actuality, and in
part is turned away from that world towards heaven and its object is the beyond of
this world.1
   ¶526. In that first aspect of the return into the Self, the vanity of all things is its own
vanity, or it is vain. It is the Self that-is-for-itself, which knows not only how to pass
judgement on and chatter about everything, but how to give spirited expression to
the  firm essences of actuality, as also to the firm determinations posited by judge-
ment, in their contradiction, and this contradiction is their truth.—From the point of
view of form, it knows everything to be self-alienated, Being-for-itself separated from
Being-in-itself, what is opined and the purpose separated from the truth; and
separated from both again, the Being for another, what is professed separated from
the real opinion and from the true Thing and intention.—Thus it knows how to
express correctly each moment in contrast to the other, in general the inversion of
everything; it knows better than each moment what that moment is, no matter how it
is determined. Since it knows the substantial on the side of the discord and the conflict
which the substantial unites within itself, but not on the side of this unification, it
understands very well how to              pass judgement        on the substantial, but has lost the
capacity to grasp it.—Moreover, this vanity needs the vanity of all things in order to
get from them the consciousness of the Self, it therefore engenders this vanity itself
and is the soul that supports it. Power and wealth are the supreme purposes of its
exertion, it knows that through renunciation and sacrifice it cultivates itself into the
universal, attains to the possession of it, and in this possession has universal validity;
power and wealth are the actual recognized powers. However, this its validity is itself
vain; and just by getting power and wealth in its power it knows they are not Self-
essences, knows rather itself as the power over them, but them as vain. The fact that
in possessing them it is itself outside them, it displays in the spirited language which
is, therefore, its supreme interest and the truth of the whole; in such language, this
Self, as this pure Self, belonging neither to actual determinations nor to determin-
ations in thought, becomes a spiritual Self that is genuinely universally valid. It is the
self-dismembering nature of all relationships and the conscious dismembering of
them; but only as self-consciousness in revolt does it know its own dismemberment
and, in this knowledge of it, it has immediately risen above it. In that vanity, all
---
                                                                                          .        

content becomes something negative which can no longer be grasped positively; the
positive object is merely the pure I itself, and the dismembered consciousness is                            in
itself this pure likeness-to-itself of self-consciousness that has returned to itself. 1
b. Faith and pure insight
¶527. The spirit of the alienation of itself has its Being-there in the world of culture;
but since this whole has become alienated from itself, there stands beyond that world
the unactual world of pure consciousness, or of thinking. Its content is what is purely
thought, thinking is its absolute element. But since thinking is initially the element of
this world, consciousness only has these thoughts, but it does not yet think them, or it
does not know that they are thoughts; but they are for consciousness in the form of
representation. For it steps out of actuality into pure consciousness, yet is itself in
general still in the sphere and determinacy of actuality. The dismembered conscious-
ness is at first in itself the likeness-to-itself of pure consciousness, for us, not for itself.
Thus it is only the immediate elevation, not yet accomplished within itself, and it still
has within it its opposite principle by which it is conditioned, without having become
master of it through the mediated movement. Consequently, the essence of its
thought counts for it, not as essence only in the form of the abstract in-itself, but in
the form of a common-actuality, of an actuality that has only been raised into another
element without having lost in this element the determinacy of an unthought
actuality.—It is essential to distinguish it from the in-itself                   which is the essence of
the   stoic consciousness; what counted for Stoicism was only the form of thought as
such, which, besides that, has some alien content taken from actuality; but what
counts for the consciousness under consideration is not the                            form of thought;—
likewise it is essentially distinct from the in-itself of the virtuous consciousness, for
which the essence does indeed stand in relation to actuality, and for which it is
essence of actuality itself, but is initially only unactual essence;—for the conscious-
ness under discussion what counts is the essence that, although beyond actuality, is
yet actual essence. Similarly, the right and good in itself of law-giving reason, and the
universal of law-testing consciousness, do not have the determination of actuality.—
If therefore pure thinking fell within the world of culture itself as an aspect of
alienation, viz. as the standard of the abstract good and bad in judging, then, having
passed through the movement of the whole, it has become enriched with the moment
of actuality and thereby of content. But this actuality of the essence is at the same
time only an actuality of pure consciousness, not of actual                      consciousness; although
raised into the element of thinking, it does not yet count as a thought for this
consciousness, but rather it lies for it beyond its own actuality; for the actuality of
the essence is the flight from its own actuality. 1
    ¶528.    Religion—for that is obviously what we are talking about,—as it emerges
here as the faith of the world of culture, does not yet emerge as it is in and for itself.—
It has already appeared to us in other determinacies, viz. as unhappy consciousness, as
a shape of the substance-bereft movement of consciousness itself.—It appeared, too,
in the ethical substance as faith in the underworld; but consciousness of the departed
spirit is, strictly speaking, not faith, not the essence posited in the element of pure
consciousness beyond the actual, but faith itself has immediate presence; its ele-
ment is the family.—Here, however, religion has for one thing proceeded from the
---
     (.)    

substance     and is pure consciousness of it; for another, this pure consciousness is
alienated from its actual consciousness, the essence is alienated from its Being-there.
So religion is indeed no longer the substance-bereft movement of consciousness, but
it still has the determinacy of opposition to actuality as this actuality in general, and
of opposition to the actuality of self-consciousness in particular; it is therefore
essentially only a faith.1
   ¶529. This pure consciousness of the absolute essence is an alienated consciousness.
We have to look more closely to see how that of which it is the other determines itself,
and we must consider it only in connection with this other. Initially, then, this pure
consciousness seems to have over against it only the world of actuality; but since it is
the flight from this world and therefore is the determinacy of opposition, it has this
determinacy within itself; pure consciousness is therefore within its own self alien-
ated from itself, and faith constitutes only one side of it. At the same time, the other
side has already arisen for us. Pure consciousness, that is, is reflection out of the
world of culture in such a way that the substance of that world, as well as the masses
into which it articulates itself, show up as what they are in themselves, as spiritual
essentialities, as absolutely restless movements or determinations which immediately
sublate themselves in their contrary. Their essence, simple consciousness, is thus the
simplicity of the absolute difference which is immediately no difference. Consequently,
it is pure    Being-for-itself, not as the Being-for-itself of                this singleton, but the Self,
universal within itself, as restless movement which attacks and pervades the tranquil
essence of the Thing. Thus there is present in this Self the certainty that immediately
knows itself as truth, pure thinking as the absolute concept in the power of its negativity,
which eliminates every objective essence supposedly standing over against conscious-
ness, and makes it into a Being of consciousness.—This pure consciousness is at the
same time equally simple, just because its difference is no difference. But as this form of
simple reflection-into-itself, it is the element of faith in which spirit has the determin-
acy of positive universality, of Being-in-itself in contrast to that Being-for-itself of self-
consciousness.—Forced back into itself out of the essenceless, merely dissolving world,
spirit, in accordance with the truth, is in an undivided unity the absolute movement and
negativity    of its appearing, as well as its inwardly                satisfied   essence and its positive
repose. But lying in general under the determinacy of alienation, these two moments
fall apart as a dual consciousness. The former is pure insight as the spiritual process
concentrating itself in self-consciousness, a process which is confronted by conscious-
ness of what is positive, the form of objectivity or of representation, and which turns
against it; but pure insight’s own object is only the pure I.—The simple consciousness
of the positive, or of tranquil likeness-to-itself, on the other hand, has for its object the
inner essence as essence. Pure insight initially has, therefore, no content within itself,
because it is negative Being-for-itself; to faith, on the other hand, there belongs content,
without insight. If the former does not step outside self-consciousness, the latter
certainly has its content in the element of pure self-consciousness likewise, but in
thinking, not in concepts, in pure consciousness, not in pure self-consciousness. Hence
faith is certainly pure consciousness of the essence, i.e. of the simple interior, and thus is
thinking,—the cardinal moment in the nature of faith, which is usually overlooked.
The immediacy, with which the essence is in it, lies in the fact that its object is essence,
i.e.  a  pure     thought.     This    immediacy,       however,       so  far as     thinking      enters   into
---
                                                                                           .         

consciousness, or pure consciousness enters into self-consciousness, acquires the
significance of an objective Being             which lies beyond the consciousness of the Self.
It is through this meaning which the immediacy and simplicity of                               pure thinking
obtains in       consciousness, that the          essence    of faith declines from thinking into
representation, and becomes a supersensible world which is, supposedly, essentially
an other of self-consciousness.—In pure insight, on the other hand, the transition of
pure thinking into consciousness has the opposite determination; objectivity has the
significance of a merely negative, self-sublating content, returning into the Self; that
is to say, only the Self is really the object to itself, or the object only has truth so far
as it has the form of the Self.1
    ¶530. Just as faith and pure insight belong in common to the element of pure
consciousness, so also are they in common the return from the actual world of
culture. Consequently, they present themselves according to three aspects. First, each
is  in and for itself, apart from all relationships; secondly, each relates to the                       actual
world, which is opposed to pure consciousness; and thirdly, each relates to the other
within pure consciousness.
    ¶531. In the       faithful    consciousness, the aspect of             Being-in-and-for-itself       is its
absolute object whose content and determination has emerged. For according to the
concept of faith the object is nothing other than the real world raised into the
universality of pure consciousness. The articulation of the real world, therefore,
constitutes the organization of the universality of pure consciousness too, except that
in the latter the parts do not alienate themselves in their inspiriting, but are essences
that are in and for themselves, spirits that have returned into themselves and abide
together with themselves.—The movement of their transition is therefore only for
us an alienation of the determinacy in which they are in their difference, and only for
us is it a necessary series; for faith, however, their difference is a tranquil diversity and
their movement a happening.1
    ¶532. To name them briefly according to the external determination of their form:
just as in the world of culture State-power, or the good, was the first term, so here,
too, the first is the absolute essence, spirit that is-in- and -for-itself, insofar as it is the
simple eternal substance. But in the realization of its concept, which consists in being
spirit, it passes over into Being for another; its likeness-to-itself becomes an actual,
self-sacrificing absolute essence; it becomes a Self, but a transitory Self. Consequently,
the third term is the return of this alienated Self and of the demoted substance into
their initial simplicity; only in this way is substance represented as spirit.1
    ¶533. These distinct essences, when taken back into themselves by thinking, out of
the   flux of the actual world, are immutable eternal spirits, whose Being consists in
thinking the unity which they constitute. Removed thus from self-consciousness,
these essences nevertheless intervene in it; if the essence were unmoved in the form of
the first simple substance, it would remain alien to self-consciousness. But the estrange-
ment of this substance, and then its spirit, has in self-consciousness the moment of
actuality and thereby makes itself a participant in the faithful self-consciousness, or the
faithful consciousness belongs to the real world.1
    ¶534. According to this second relationship, on the one hand the faithful con-
sciousness itself has its actuality in the real world of culture, and constitutes the
spirit of that world and its Being-there which we have already considered; but on
---
     (.)    

the other hand, the faithful consciousness confronts this its actuality as a vanity, and
is the movement of sublating it. This movement does not consist in its having a
high-spirited consciousness about the perversion of the real world; for it is the
simple consciousness, which counts the high-spirited as a vanity, because high-
spiritedness still has the real world for its purpose. On the contrary, the real world
confronts the tranquil realm of its thinking as a spiritless Being-there, which therefore
has to be overcome in an external manner. This obedience of service and praise, by
sublating sensory knowing and doing, produces the consciousness of unity with the
essence that is-in-and-for-itself, though not as intuited actual unity, but rather this
service is only the perpetual producing, which does not completely attain its goal in the
present. The community does indeed attain to it, for it is universal self-consciousness;
but for the singular self-consciousness the realm of pure thinking necessarily remains
a beyond of its actuality, or since this beyond, through the estrangement of the eternal
essence, has entered into actuality, the actuality is an uncomprehended, sensory
actuality; but one sensory actuality remains indifferent to the other, and the beyond
has only received the further determination of remoteness in space and time.—
However, the concept, the actuality of spirit present to itself, remains in the faithful
consciousness the interior, which is everything and produces everything, but does not
itself come forth.1
   ¶535. In pure insight, however, the concept is alone the actual; and this third aspect
of faith, that of being an object for pure insight, is the proper relationship in which
faith here appears.—Pure insight itself is likewise to be considered partly in and for
itself, partly in relationship to the actual world so far as this is still present positively,
viz. as vain consciousness, and lastly, in that relation to faith.1
   ¶536. We have seen what pure insight is in and for itself; as faith is the tranquil
pure consciousness of spirit as essence, so is pure insight the self-consciousness of this
essence; it therefore knows the essence, not as essence, but as absolute Self. It therefore
sets out to sublate all independence that is other to self-consciousness, whether it be
the independence of the actual or of what-is-in-itself, and to make it into a concept.
Pure insight is not only the certainty of self-conscious reason that it is all truth; but it
knows that it is.
    ¶537. However, as the concept of pure insight first enters the scene, it is not yet
realized. Accordingly, its consciousness still appears as contingent, singular conscious-
ness, and what is for it the essence appears as a purpose, which it has to actualize. It
has, at first, the intention of making pure insight universal, i.e. of making everything
that is actual into a concept, and into a concept in every self-consciousness. The
intention is pure, for it has pure insight for its content; and this insight is likewise pure,
for its content is solely the absolute concept, which meets with no opposition in an
object, nor is it limited within its own self. In the unlimited concept there lie
immediately the two aspects: that everything objective has only the significance of
Being-for-itself, of self-consciousness, and that this has the significance of a universal,
that pure insight should become the property of every self-consciousness. This second
aspect of the intention is a result of culture insofar as in culture the differences of
objective spirit, the parts and the determinations of judgement of its world, as well as
the differences that appear as originally determinate natures, have all perished.
Genius, talent, particular capacities in general, belong to the world of actuality, insofar
---
                                                                                          .         

as this world still contains the aspect of being a spiritual animal kingdom, which,
amid confusion and mutual violence, cheats and struggles over the essence of the real
world.—The differences, certainly, have no place in this world as honest espèces;
individuality neither contents itself with the unactual Thing itself nor has it particular
content and purposes of its own. On the contrary, it counts merely as something
universally valid, viz. as cultivated; and the difference is reduced to less or greater
energy,—a quantitative difference, i.e. an inessential difference. This last diversity has,
however, been effaced by the fact that in the complete dismemberment of conscious-
ness the difference turned into an absolutely qualitative difference. In dismember-
ment, what is for the I the other, is only the I itself. In this infinite judgement all one-
sidedness and peculiarity of the original Being-for-itself is eradicated; the Self knows
itself, as pure Self, to be its object; and this absolute likeness of both sides is the
element of pure insight.—Pure insight is, therefore, the simple, internally undifferen-
tiated essence, and equally the universal work and universal possession. In this simple
spiritual substance, self-consciousness gives itself and maintains in every object the
consciousness of this its singularity or doing, just as, conversely, the individuality of
self-consciousness is therein like itself and universal.—This pure insight is thus the
spirit that calls to
selves,—rational. 1      every    consciousness:      be for yourselves       what you all       are in your-
.   
¶538. The peculiar object against which pure insight directs the force of the concept
is faith, as the form of pure consciousness confronting it in the same element. But it
also has a relation to the actual world for, like faith, it is the return from the actual
world into pure consciousness. We have, first of all, to see how its activity with regard
to the impure intentions and perverse insights of the actual world is constituted.
   ¶539. We have already mentioned the tranquil consciousness that stands opposed
to this turmoil which, having once settled down starts up all over again; it constitutes
the side of pure insight and intention. This tranquil consciousness, however, has, as
we saw, no particular insight about the world of culture; this world itself has rather
the most painful feeling and the truest insight about itself—the feeling that all its
bulwarks are crumbling, that through all moments of its Being-there it is being
broken on the wheel and all its bones smashed; it is also the language of this feeling
and the spirited talk which pronounces judgement on every aspect of its condition.
Here, therefore, pure insight can have no activity and content of its own and thus can
only conduct itself as the formal and trustworthy apprehension of this spirited insight
of the world and of its language. Since this language is dispersed, and the assessment
some gossip of the instant, which at once gets forgotten again, and is a whole only for
a third consciousness, this third consciousness can only differentiate itself as pure
insight by the fact it concentrates these dispersed traits into a universal picture and
then makes them into an insight for everyone.1
   ¶540. By this simple means pure insight will manage to dispel the confusion of this
world. For it has emerged that it is not the masses and the determinate concepts and
individualities that are the essence of this actuality, but that this has its substance and
support solely in the spirit which exists as judging and discussing, and that the
interest of having a content for this ratiocination and chatter alone preserves the whole
---
     (.)    

and the masses of its articulation. In this language of insight, its self-consciousness
is for it still a being-for-itself, this singleton; but the vanity of the content is at the same
time the vanity of the Self that knows it is vain. Now when the calmly apprehending
consciousness brings into a collection the most striking versions of all this spirited
prattle, the versions that penetrate the Thing, then the soul that still preserves the
whole, the vanity of spirited assessment, goes to join the other vanity of Being-there, it
goes to ruin. The collection shows to most people a better wit, or to everyone at least a
more varied wit, than their own, and shows that knowing-all and passing judgement in
general are something universal and now universally familiar; with this, the only
interest that was still present evaporates, and singular insightfulness is resolved into
universal insight. However, the knowledge of the essence still stands firm above vain
knowledge, and pure insight only appears in its proper activity insofar as it enters the
lists against faith.1
a. The struggle of the enlightenment with superstition
¶541. The various modes of the negative attitude of consciousness, the attitude of
scepticism and that of theoretical and practical idealism, are subordinate shapes
compared with that of            pure insight     and its diffusion, the        enlightenment; for pure
insight is born of the substance, knows the pure                   Self  of consciousness as absolute,
and copes with the pure consciousness of the absolute essence of all actuality.—
Since faith and insight are the same pure consciousness, but opposed as regards
form—the essence is for faith as               thought, not as        concept, and therefore a sheer
opposite to self-consciousness, whereas for pure insight the essence is the Self—each is
for the other the sheer negative of it.—As the two enter the lists against each other, all
content pertains to faith; for each moment, in its tranquil element of thinking, obtains
subsistence;—while pure insight is initially devoid of content and is rather the pure
vanishing of it; but by the negative movement against what is negative to it, it will
realize itself and give itself a content.1
    ¶542. Pure insight knows faith as what is opposed to it, opposed to reason and
truth. Just as faith is, for pure insight, in general a tissue of superstitions,
prejudices, and errors, so for it the consciousness of this content further organizes
itself into a realm of error in which, on the one hand, false insight is as the
universal mass of consciousness, immediately, naively, and without reflection into
itself,   but   it  also    has   in   it  the    moment       of   reflection-into-self,       or   of   self-
consciousness, separated from the naivety, as an insight which remains for itself
in the background, and an evil intention by which that naive consciousness is
duped. The mass is the sacrificial victim of the deception of a priesthood                             which
pursues its envious vanity, of being in exclusive possession of insight, as well as its
further self-interest, and at the same time it conspires with despotism which, as a
synthetic, non-conceptual unity of the real realm and this ideal realm—a curiously
inconsistent essence—stands above the bad insight of the multitude and the bad
intent of the priests, and also unites both within itself; from the stupidity and
confusion of the people by the means of the deceiving priesthood, despotism,
which despises both, derives the advantage of undisturbed domination and the
fulfilment of its desires and wilfulness, but is at the same time the same dullness of
insight, the same superstition and error.1

                                                                                          .        

    ¶543. The enlightenment does not strike against these three sides of the enemy
indiscriminately; for since its essence is pure insight, the universal in and for itself, its
true relation to the other extreme is that in which it aims at what is common and alike
in both extremes. The side of             singularity, isolating itself from the universal naive
consciousness, is its opposition which it cannot immediately affect. The immediate
object of its activity is therefore not the will of the deceiving priesthood and of the
oppressive despot, but rather the insight devoid of will that does not singularize itself
to Being-for-itself, the        concept of rational self-consciousness which has its Being-
there in the mass but is not yet present in it as concept. Pure insight, however, in
wrenching this honest insight and its naive essence away from prejudices and errors,
wrests from the hands of the bad intent the reality and power of its deceit, an intent
whose realm has its soil and material in the uncomprehending consciousness of the
universal mass—whose Being-for-itself has its substance in the simple consciousness
in general.1
    ¶544. The relation of pure insight to the naive consciousness of the absolute
essence now has a twofold aspect: on the one hand, pure insight is                               in itself  the
same as that consciousness, but on the other hand, this naive consciousness gives free
rein to the absolute essence, as well as to its parts, in the simple element of its thought,
and lets them acquire subsistence and be valid only as its in-itself and hence in an
objective manner, but in this in-itself it disowns its                     Being-for-itself.—Insofar as,
according to the first aspect, for pure insight this faith is in itself pure self-conscious-
ness and ought only to become this for itself, pure insight has, in this concept of faith,
the element in which, instead of false insight, it realizes itself.1
    ¶545. Since from this aspect both are essentially the same and the relation of pure
insight happens through and in the same element, their communication is imme-
diate and their giving and receiving is an unimpeded flow of each into the other.
Whatever wedges of any sort may be driven into consciousness, it is                             in itself  this
simplicity in which everything is dissolved, forgotten, and naive, and which is
therefore utterly receptive to the concept. On this account the communication of
pure insight is comparable to a calm expansion or to the diffusion, say, of a perfume
in the unresisting atmosphere. It is a penetrating infection which does not make
itself noticeable beforehand as something opposed to the indifferent element into
which it insinuates itself, and therefore cannot be averted. Only when the infection
has spread is       it for the consciousness        that unheedingly submitted to it. For what
consciousness received into itself was indeed the simple essence, like itself and like
consciousness, but at the same time it was the simplicity of negativity reflected into
itself, which subsequently also unfolds, in keeping with its nature, into something
opposed to it and thereby reminds consciousness of its former state; such simplicity
is the concept, which is the simple knowing that knows itself and at the same time
its contrary, but knows this contrary as sublated within it. Consequently, as soon as
pure insight is for consciousness, it has already spread; the struggle against it
betrays the infection that has occurred; the struggle is too late, and every remedy
only aggravates the disease, for it has gripped the marrow of spiritual life, viz.
consciousness in its concept, or the pure essence itself of consciousness; therefore,
too, there is no force in consciousness which could overcome the disease. Because
the disease is in the essence itself, its manifestations, while still singularized, can be
---
      (.)   

suppressed and the superficial symptoms smothered. This is greatly to its advan-
tage; for it does not now squander its force uselessly nor does it show itself
unworthy of its essence, which is the case when it breaks out in symptoms and
single eruptions against the content of faith and against the network of its outward
actuality. Rather, now an invisible and unnoticed spirit, it infiltrates the vital parts
through and through and soon has taken complete possession of all the viscera and
members of the unconscious idol, and ‘one fine morning it gives its comrade a shove
with the elbow, and bang! crash! the idol lies on the ground.’—On one fine morning,
whose noon is not bloody if the infection has penetrated every organ of spiritual
life; memory alone then still preserves the dead mode of the spirit’s previous shape
as a vanished history, vanished one knows not how; and the new serpent of wisdom
raised on high for adoration has in this way painlessly shed merely a withered skin.1
    ¶546. But this silent, ceaseless weaving of the spirit in the simple interior of its
substance, spirit concealing its doing from itself, is only one side of the realization of
pure insight. Its diffusion consists not merely in the fact that like goes together with
like; nor is its actualization merely an expansion with no opposition. On the contrary,
the doing of the negative essence is no less essentially a developed movement
differentiating itself within itself which, as conscious doing, must set up its moments
in a determinate manifest Being-there and must be present as a loud noise and a
violent struggle with the opposition as such.1
    ¶547. We have therefore to see how                 pure insight and       intention reacts negatively
against the other opposed to it that it              finds before it.—Pure insight and intention,
which react negatively, can, since its concept is all essentiality and there is nothing
outside it, only be the negative of itself. As insight, therefore, it becomes the negative
of pure insight, it becomes untruth and unreason and, as intention, it becomes the
negative of pure intention, becomes a lie and insincerity of purpose.1
    ¶548. Pure insight gets entangled in this contradiction through engaging in dispute
and opining that it is combating something else.—It only opines this, for its essence
as absolute negativity is to have otherness within itself. The absolute concept is the
category; the concept is this: that knowing and the object of knowing are the same.
Consequently, what pure insight pronounces to be its other, what it pronounces to be
an error or a lie, can be nothing else but pure insight itself; it can condemn only what
it is itself. What is not rational has no             truth, or what is not comprehended                 is not;
when, therefore, reason speaks of an other than itself, it speaks in fact only of itself;
in this, it does not go outside itself.—This struggle with the opposition, therefore,
combines within itself the significance of being the                     actualization      of reason. This
actualization consists, that is, just in the movement of developing the moments and
taking them back into itself; one part of this movement is the differentiation in which
the comprehending insight places itself over against itself as                        object; so long as it
lingers in this moment it is alienated from itself. As pure insight it is devoid of all
content; the movement of its realization consists in it itself becoming as its content,
for nothing else can become its content because it is the self-consciousness of the
category. But since pure insight at first knows the content in its opposite only as
content and not yet as itself, it does not recognize itself in it. Its completion therefore
has the sense that it recognizes the content, which at first is objective to it, as its own
content. Its result, however, will thus be neither the re-establishment of the errors it

combats, nor merely its initial concept, but an insight that recognizes the absolute
negation of itself as its own actuality, as its own self, or its concept recognizing its
own self.—This nature of enlightenment’s combat with errors, which consists in
combating itself in them and in condemning in them what it itself affirms, is for us, or
it is what enlightenment and its combat is in itself. But it is in the first aspect of this
struggle, the defilement of enlightenment through the adoption of the negative
attitude into its self-equal purity, that it is an object for faith, and so faith experiences
it as a lie, as unreason, and as bad intention, just as faith is for enlightenment error
and prejudice.—As regards its content, it is initially an empty insight whose content
appears to it as an other, consequently, it finds it before itself in the shape of a content
which is not yet its own, as a Being-there entirely independent of itself, in faith.1
   ¶549. So the way in which enlightenment conceives its object initially and gener-
ally, is that it takes it as pure insight and that, not recognizing itself, declares it to be
error. In insight as such, consciousness grasps an object in such a way that the object
becomes for it the essence of consciousness, or becomes an object which conscious-
ness permeates, in which consciousness preserves itself, remains together with itself
and present to itself, and since it is thereby the movement of the object, produces it. It
is just this that enlightenment rightly declares faith to be, when it says of it that what
is for faith the absolute essence, is a Being of its own consciousness, is its own
thought, a product of consciousness. Enlightenment thereby declares faith to be error
and fiction with respect to the same thing as enlightenment is.—Enlightenment that
wants to teach faith the new wisdom does not tell it anything new; for faith’s object is
also for it directly this, viz. the pure essence of its own consciousness, so that this
consciousness does not posit itself as lost and negated in that object, but rather puts
its trust in it, i.e. it finds itself as this consciousness, or as self-consciousness, precisely
in the object. When I trust someone, his certainty of himself is for me the certainty of
myself; I recognize my own Being-for-myself in him, I recognize that he recognizes
my Being-for-myself and that it is for him purpose and essence. But trust is faith,
because its consciousness immediately relates to its object and it thus also intuits this:
that it is one with the object and in it.—Further, since what is an object for me is that
in which I recognize myself, in general I am at the same time in that object as another
self-consciousness, i.e. as a self-consciousness which has become, in that object,
alienated from its particular singularity, viz. from its naturalness and contingency,
but which, first, remains therein self-consciousness and, secondly, precisely in that
object, is an essential consciousness just as pure insight is.—The concept of insight
involves not only that consciousness recognizes itself in the object of its insight and,
without abandoning the element of thought and only withdrawing from it into itself,
has itself immediately in the object, but it is conscious of itself as also the mediating
movement or of itself as the doing or producing; this unity of itself as unity of the Self
and the object is thereby for it in thought.—Faith, too, is just this consciousness; the
obedience and the doing are a necessary moment, through which the certainty of
Being in the absolute essence comes about. This doing of faith does not of course
appear in such a way that the absolute essence itself is produced by it. But the
absolute essence of faith is essentially not the                  abstract    essence lying beyond the
faithful consciousness, it is, on the contrary, the spirit of the community, the unity
of the abstract essence and self-consciousness. For it to be this spirit of the
---
     (.)   

community, in this the doing of the community is an essential moment; it is the spirit
of the community,           only through the producing              of consciousness,—or rather,             not
without being produced by consciousness; or essential as the producing is, it is also
just as essentially not the sole ground of the essence, but only a moment. The essence
is at the same time in and for itself.1
   ¶550. On the other side, the concept of pure insight is to itself an other than its
object; for it is just this negative determination that constitutes the object. Thus, from
the other side, insight also declares the essence of faith to be something                             alien   to
consciousness, to be not its essence but a changeling foisted on it. But here enlight-
enment is entirely foolish; faith experiences it as a speaking that does not know what
it is saying, and does not understand the Thing when it talks about priestly deceit and
deception of the people. It speaks about this as if by some hocus-pocus of conjuring
priests something absolutely alien and other had been palmed off on consciousness as
the essence, and at the same time it says that this is an essence of consciousness, that
consciousness believes in it, puts its trust in it, and seeks to make it favourably
disposed towards itself,—i.e. that consciousness intuits in it its pure essence just as
much as its singular and universal individuality, and through its doing produces this
unity of itself with its essence. Thus what it declares to be something                                alien   to
consciousness, it immediately declares to be the ownmost                        of consciousness.—How
then can it possibly speak about deceit and deception? Since it immediately declares
the contrary of what it asserts regarding faith, it rather reveals itself to faith as the
conscious lie. How are deception and deceit supposed to take place where conscious-
ness in its truth has immediately the certainty of itself, where in its object it possesses
its own self, insofar as it just as much finds itself in it as produces itself in it? The
distinction is no longer present even in the words.—If the general question has been
proposed, whether it is permissible to delude a people, the answer would in fact have to
be that the question is pointless, because it is impossible to deceive a people in this
matter.—Brass instead of gold, counterfeit instead of genuine bonds, may well be sold
in isolated cases, many may be persuaded to believe that a battle lost was a battle won,
and other lies about sensory things and single events may be made credible for a time;
but in the knowledge of that essence in which consciousness has the
certainty of itself, the thought of deception is quite out of the question. 1                       immediate
   ¶551. Let us see further how faith experiences the enlightenment in the different
moments of its own consciousness, to which the view indicated above referred only
generally. These moments are: pure thinking or, as object, the absolute essence in and
for itself; then its relation—as a knowing—to the absolute essence, the ground of its
faith, and lastly, its relation to absolute essence in its doing, or its service. Just as pure
insight has in general failed to recognize itself, and has denied itself, in faith, so too in
these moments it will behave in an equally perverse manner.1
   ¶552. Pure insight adopts a negative attitude to the absolute essence of the faithful
consciousness. This essence is pure thinking, and pure thinking posited within itself
as an object or as the essence; in the faithful consciousness, this in-itself of thinking
acquires at the same time, for consciousness that is for itself, the form, but only the
empty form, of objectivity; the in-itself is in the determination of something repre-
sented. To pure insight, however, since it is pure consciousness on the side of the Self
that is for itself, the other appears as a negative of self-consciousness. This could still be
---
                                                                                           .         

taken either as the pure in-itself of thinking, or alternatively as the Being of sensory
certainty. But since it is at the same time for the Self and this, as a Self that has an
object, is actual consciousness, pure insight’s peculiar object as such is an                         ordinary
thing   of  sensory certainty, a thing that is. This its object appears to insight in the
representation of faith. It condemns this representation, and in it its own object. But
here it already does faith the injustice of conceiving its object as if it were its own
object. For according to this it says about faith that its absolute essence is a piece of
stone, a block of wood, which has eyes and sees not, or again, a piece of dough which,
having grown in the          field, is transformed by man and returned to the field,—or in
whatever other ways faith anthropomorphizes the essence, making it objective and
representable to itself.1
   ¶553. Enlightenment, which professes to be pure, here makes what is, for spirit,
eternal life and holy spirit into an actual,             transitory thing, and defiles it with the in
itself nugatory view of sensory certainty—with a view that is entirely absent from
faith in its worship, so that it is a downright lie when enlightenment imputes this
view to faith. What faith reveres, is for it by no means either stone or wood or dough,
nor any other temporal, sensory thing. If enlightenment has a mind to say that, all the
same, its object is also this, or even that it is in itself and in truth this, then first, faith
is equally well aware of that Also, but it lies outside its worship; but secondly, for faith
in general such a thing as a stone, etc. is not in itself; on the contrary, what is in itself
for faith is solely the essence of pure thinking.1
   ¶554. The second moment is the relation of faith as a knowing                           consciousness to
this essence. For faith, as a pure thinking consciousness, this essence is immediate;
but the pure consciousness is just as much a                    mediated     relation of certainty to the
truth; a relation which constitutes the ground of faith. For enlightenment, this ground
likewise becomes a contingent knowledge of contingent events. But the ground of the
knowledge is the         knowing      universal and in its truth the absolute                spirit  which, in
abstract pure consciousness or in thinking as such, is only absolute essence, but, as
self-consciousness, is the           knowledge      of itself. Pure insight posits this conscious
universal, the simple, self-knowing spirit, likewise as a negative of self-consciousness.
Pure insight itself is indeed pure mediated thinking, i.e. thinking that mediates itself
with itself, it is pure knowing; but since it is a pure insight, a pure knowing, that does
not as yet know itself, i.e. is not yet aware that it is this pure mediating movement,
the movement appears to insight, as does everything that it itself is, as an other.
Comprehended in its actualization, therefore, it develops this moment that is essen-
tial to it, but this moment appears to it as belonging to faith and, in its determinacy of
being something external to pure insight, as a contingent knowledge of just such
commonly actual historical narratives. Here, then, it falsely imputes to religious belief
that its certainty is grounded on some single historical testimonies which, considered
as historical testimonies, would certainly not yield the degree of certainty about their
content which is given by newspaper accounts of any happening; further, that its
certainty rests on the contingence of the                preservation of these testimonies—on the
one hand, the preservation by means of paper, and on the other hand, by the skill and
honesty of the transference from one piece of paper to another—, and lastly, on the
correct interpretation of the sense of dead words and letters. In fact, however, it does
not occur to faith to tie its certainty to such testimonies and contingencies; faith, in its
---
     (.)    

certainty, is an unsophisticated relationship to its absolute object, a pure knowing of
it which does not mix in letters, paper, and copyists with its consciousness of the
absolute essence, and does not mediate itself with it through such things. On the
contrary, this consciousness is the self-mediating ground of its knowledge; it is the
spirit itself which bears witness to itself, in the interior of the singular consciousness
as well as through the universal presence in everyone of faith in this spirit. If faith also
wants to obtain from history that mode of grounding, or at least confirmation, of its
content that enlightenment talks about, and seriously opines and acts as if that were
of any importance, then it has already let itself be seduced by the enlightenment; and
its efforts to ground and consolidate itself in such a way are merely testimonies it
gives of its infection.1
    ¶555. There still remains the third side, the                    relation of consciousness to the
absolute essence, as a        doing. This doing is the sublation of the particularity of the
individual, or of the natural mode of its Being-for-itself, whence proceeds its
certainty of being pure self-consciousness in accordance with its doing, i.e. of
being, as singular consciousness that                is-in-and-for-itself, one with the essence.—
Since, in doing, purpose and fitness for purpose are distinguished, and pure insight in
relation to this doing likewise              adopts a negative attitude            and, as in the other
moments, denies its own self, it must, as regards fitness for purpose, display its lack
of understanding, since insight combined with intention, the agreement of purpose
and means, appears to it as an other, or rather as the contrary of insight,—but as
regards the purpose it has to make the bad, enjoyment, and possession its purpose and
thereby prove itself to be the impurest intention, since pure intention, as other, is
equally impure intention.1
    ¶556. Accordingly, we see that as regards                 purposiveness, enlightenment             finds it
foolish when the faithful individual awards himself the superior consciousness of not
being chained to natural enjoyment and pleasure by actually denying himself natural
enjoyment and pleasure, and demonstrating by his deed that his contempt for them is
no   lie  but is    true.—Similarly, enlightenment              finds it foolish that the individual
absolves himself of his determinacy of being absolutely singular, excluding all others
and possessing property, by itself giving up its property; whereby he shows in truth
that he is not in earnest with this isolation of himself, but is elevated above the natural
necessity of singularizing himself and of denying, in this absolute singularization of
Being-for-itself, that others are the same thing                as himself.—Pure insight finds both
unfit for the purpose as well as wrong,—it is not to the purpose of proving oneself free
of pleasure and possession, to deny oneself pleasure and give away a possession; in
the contrary case, therefore, pure insight will declare someone a fool who, in order to
eat, adopts the means of actually eating.—Insight also finds it wrong to deny oneself a
meal and to give away butter and eggs, not for money, or give away money and not
for butter and eggs, but simply to give them away without receiving anything in
return; it declares a meal or the possession of things of that sort to be an end in itself,
and hence in fact declares itself to be a very impure intention, which treats such
enjoyment and possession as something wholly essential. Again, it also affirms as a
pure intention the necessity of rising above natural existence, above acquisitiveness
about the means of existence; only it finds it foolish and wrong that this elevation
should be demonstrated             through the deed, or this pure intention is in truth a
---
                                                                                          .         

deception, which feigns and demands an inner elevation, but presents it as superflu-
ous, foolish, and even wrong to be in earnest about it, to put this elevation actually to
work and demonstrate its truth.—Pure insight thus denies itself both as pure insight,
for it denies immediately purposive doing, and as pure intention, for it denies the
intention of proving itself freed from the purposes of singularity.1
    ¶557. It is thus that enlightenment submits itself to be experienced by faith. It
presents itself in this bad light because, just by its relationship to an other, it gives
itself a negative reality, or exhibits itself as the contrary of itself; but pure insight and
intention must enter into this relationship, for it is their actualization.—This actual-
ization initially appeared as a negative reality. Perhaps its                    positive reality     is better
constituted; let us see how things stand with this.—If all prejudice and superstition
have been banished, the question arises, What next? What is the truth enlightenment
has propagated in their stead?—It has already declared this positive content in its
extirpation of error, for that alienation of itself is just as much its positive reality.—In
what, for faith, is absolute spirit, it interprets any determination it discovers there as
wood, stone, etc., as singular, actual things; since in general it comprehends                                all
determinacy, i.e. all its content and filling, in this way as a finitude, as human essence
and representation, the          absolute essence        becomes for enlightenment a              vacuum      to
which no determinations, no predicates, can be attributed. Such a coupling would be
in itself reprehensible; and it is just in this that the monstrosities of superstition have
been engendered. Reason, pure insight, is certainly not empty itself, since the negative
of itself is    for it, and is its content; on the contrary, it is rich, but rich only in
singularity and limitation; to let nothing of that sort appertain to the absolute essence
or be attributed to it, this is reason’s insightful mode of living, which knows how to
put itself and its wealth of finitude in their place, and how to deal with the absolute in
a worthy manner.1
    ¶558. In contrast to this empty essence there stands, as the second moment                                of
the positive truth of enlightenment,                  singularity     in general, excluded from an
absolute essence, the singularity of consciousness and of all Being, as                               absolute
Being-in-and-for-itself. Consciousness, which in its very                       first actuality is     sensory
certainty     and   meaning, returns here to this from the whole course of its experi-
ence and is again a knowledge of what is                     purely negative of itself, or of          sensory
things, i.e.    beings, which indifferently confront its Being-for-itself. Here, however,
it is not immediate, natural consciousness, but it has become such a consciousness
to itself. At first at the mercy of all the entanglement into which it was plunged by
its unfolding, now led back by pure insight to its                      first shape, it has      experienced
that shape as the         result.   Grounded       on insight into the nothingness of all other
shapes of consciousness and hence of everything beyond sensory certainty, this
sensory certainty is no longer meaning, but is rather the absolute truth. This
nothingness of everything that lies beyond sensory certainty is no doubt merely a
negative proof of this truth; but it is not susceptible of any other proof; for the
positive truth of sensory certainty within its own self is just the unmediated Being-
for-itself of the concept itself as object, and that too in the form of otherness,—
that to every consciousness it is utterly certain                  that it   is, and   other actual things
outside it, and that in its natural Being it, like these things, is in and for itself or
absolute. 1
---
     (.)    

    ¶559. Lastly, the third moment of the truth of enlightenment is the relationship of
the singular essences to the absolute essence, the relation between the                              first two
moments. Insight, as pure insight into what is like or unrestricted, also goes beyond
what is unlike, viz. beyond finite actuality, or beyond itself as mere otherness. As the
beyond of this otherness it has the void                to which, therefore, it relates the sensory
actuality. Into the determination of this relationship, both of the sides do not enter as
content, for one of them is the void, and it is only through the other, the sensory
actuality, that a content is present. But the form of the relation, to the determination
of which the side of the in-itself contributes, is a matter of choice; for the form is what
is in itself negative, and therefore self-opposed; Being as well as nothing; in-itself                        as
well as the contrary; or, what is the same thing, the relation of actuality to in-itself as
the beyond, is as much a             negating     as a   positing    of actuality. Finite actuality can
therefore, properly speaking, be taken just as one requires. The sensory is therefore
now related       positively    to the absolute as to the           in-itself, and sensory actuality is
itself  in itself; the absolute makes it, fosters and cherishes it. Again, sensory
actuality is related to the absolute as its contrary, as to its own non-Being; in this
relationship it is not in itself, but only for an other. Whereas in the preceding shape
of consciousness the concepts             of the opposition were determined as the good                     and
bad, for pure insight, by contrast, they become the purer abstractions of Being-in-
itself and Being-for-an-other. 1
    ¶560. Both ways of viewing the positive and the negative relations of the finite to
the in-itself are, however, in fact equally necessary, and everything is thus as much in
itself as it is for an other, or everything is useful. Everything surrenders to everything
else, now lets itself be used by others and is for them, and now, so to speak, stands
again on its hind legs, is stand-offish towards the other, is for itself, and uses the other
in its turn.—For man, as the thing conscious of this relation, there emerges from this
his essence and his position. As he is immediately, as natural consciousness in itself,
man is good, as a singular consciousness he is absolute and the other is for him; and
moreover, since the moments have for him, as the animal conscious of itself, the
significance of universality, everything is for his pleasure and amusement and, as one
who has come from the hand of God, he roams in the world as in a garden planted for
him.—He must also have plucked from the tree of the cognition of good and evil; he
possesses in this an advantage which distinguishes him from all other creatures, for
it so happens that his nature, though good in itself, is                    also   so constituted that an
excess of amusement does it harm, or rather his singularity has                             also its beyond
within it, can go beyond itself and destroy itself. Countering this, reason is for him a
useful means for appropriately restricting this transgression, or rather for preserv-
ing himself when he oversteps what is determined; for this is the force of con-
sciousness. Enjoyment on the part of the conscious essence that is in itself universal,
must not itself be something determinate as regards variety and duration, but
universal; measure therefore has the determination of preventing pleasure in its
variety and duration from being cut short; i.e. the determination of measure is
measurelessness.—Just as everything is useful to man, so man is useful likewise, and
his determination is just as much to make himself a publicly useful and serviceable
member of the troop. He must serve the others just as much as he takes care of
himself, and so far as he serves others, so far is he taking care of himself: one hand

washes the other. But wherever he is to be found, there he is in his right place; he
makes use of others and is made use of himself.1
   ¶561. Different things are useful to one another in different ways; but all things
have this useful reciprocity through their essence, viz. through being related to the
absolute in two ways, the positive way, whereby they are themselves                                in and for
themselves, and the negative, whereby they are for others. The relation to the absolute
essence, or religion, is therefore of all usefulness the most useful of all; for it is pure
utility itself, it is this subsistence of all things, or their Being-in-and-for-themselves,
and it is the fall of all things, or their Being for an other thing.1
   ¶562. To faith, of course, this positive result of enlightenment is as much an
abomination as its negative attitude towards faith. This insight into the absolute
essence which sees nothing in it but just the absolute essence, the être suprême, or the
void,—this intention according to which everything in its immediate Being-there is in
itself or good, that finally, the relation of the singular conscious Being to the absolute
essence, religion, is exhaustively expressed by the concept of utility, is for faith utterly
detestable. This wisdom, peculiar to enlightenment, necessarily appears to faith at the
same time as banality itself and as the confession of banality; because it consists in
knowing nothing of the absolute essence or, what amounts to the same thing, in
knowing this entirely insipid truth about it, that it is precisely only the                           absolute
essence; and, on the other hand, in knowing only of finitude and, moreover, knowing
it as the true, and knowing this knowledge of finitude as the true, as the highest. 1
   ¶563. Faith has the divine right, the right of absolute likeness-to-itself                      or of pure
thinking, as against enlightenment, and it receives at its hands nothing but wrong; for
enlightenment distorts faith in all its moments, changing them into something other
than they are in it. But enlightenment has only a human right as against faith and for
its own truth; for the wrong it commits is the right of unlikeness, and consists in
perverting and altering, a right which belongs to the nature of self-consciousness in
opposition to the simple essence or to thinking. But since the right of enlightenment
is the right of self-consciousness, it will not only also retain the right, so that two
equal rights of spirit would be left confronting each other and neither could satisfy
the other, but it will maintain its absolute right because self-consciousness is the
negativity of the concept, a negativity which is not only for itself, but also encroaches
on its contrary; and because faith itself is a consciousness it will not be able to deny
enlightenment its right.1
   ¶564. For enlightenment does not counter the faithful consciousness with prin-
ciples peculiar to itself, but with principles which the faithful consciousness has in it;
enlightenment merely presents faith with its own thoughts, bringing them together,
while faith unconsciously lets them fall apart; it merely reminds faith when one of its
modes is present to it, of the other modes which it also has, but one of which it always
forgets when the other mode is present. Enlightenment shows itself to faith to be pure
insight by the fact that in a determinate                moment it sees the whole, and so brings
forward the opposite relating to this moment, and, inverting one in the other, brings
out the negative essence of both thoughts, the                      concept. To faith, enlightenment
appears as a distortion and a lie just because it points out the otherness of its moments;
in doing so, it seems to faith immediately to make something else out of them than
they are in their singularity; but this other is equally essential and in truth it is present
---
     (.)    

in the faithful consciousness itself, only this does not think about it, but has it
somewhere else; consequently, it is neither alien to faith, nor can faith disavow it.1
    ¶565. Enlightenment itself, however, which reminds faith of the opposite of its
separated moments, is no more enlightened about itself. It has a purely                               negative
attitude towards faith in that it excludes its own content from its purity and takes that
content to be the          negative    of itself. It therefore neither recognizes itself in this
negative, in the content of faith, nor for this reason does it bring the two thoughts
together, the one which it brings forward itself and the one against which it brings
forward the       first. Since it does not recognize that what it condemns in faith is
immediately its own thought, it is itself in the opposition of the two moments, only
one of which, viz. in every case the one opposed to faith, it recognizes, but separates
the other from the first, just as faith does. Consequently, enlightenment does not
produce the unity of both as the unity of these moments, i.e. the concept; but the
concept arises       before it for itself, or enlightenment            finds the concept merely as            at
hand. For, in itself, the realization of pure insight is just this, that insight, whose
essence is the concept, at first becomes to itself as an absolute other and repudiates
itself—for the opposition of the concept is an absolute opposition—and out of this
otherness it comes to itself, or to its concept.—But enlightenment                               is only this
movement, it is the still unconscious activity of the pure concept, an activity which
does indeed arrive at itself as object, but takes it to be an other and, also, is not aware
of the nature of the concept, viz. that it is the undifferentiated which absolutely
sunders itself.—As against faith, then, insight is the power of the concept insofar as it
is the movement and the relating of the moments lying apart in faith’s consciousness,
a relating in which their contradiction comes to light. Herein lies the absolute right
of the force which insight exercises over faith; but the                   actuality    to which it brings
this force lies just in the fact that the faithful consciousness is itself the concept,
and therefore itself recognizes the opposite which insight puts before it. Insight is
therefore in the right as against the faithful consciousness because it makes valid in
faith what is necessary to faith itself and what faith has in itself.1
    ¶566. First of all, enlightenment affirms this moment of the concept, that it is a
doing of consciousness; it affirms this against               faith,—that its absolute essence is an
essence of its consciousness as a Self, or that it has been produced through conscious-
ness. To the faithful consciousness its absolute essence, just as it is the in-itself for
it, is at the same time not like an alien thing situated in it, one knows not how and
whence; on the contrary, its trust consists just in its finding                     itself as  this personal
consciousness in the absolute essence, and its obedience and service consist in
producing it, through its           doing, as    its absolute essence. Enlightenment really only
reminds faith of this, if faith roundly declares that the in-itself of the absolute
essence lies beyond the doing of consciousness.—But while it does indeed supple-
ment the one-sidedness of faith with the opposite moment of the doing of faith in
contrast to the       Being, of which alone faith is thinking here, enlightenment itself
equally does not bring its thoughts together; it isolates the pure moment of                             doing
and declares of the in-itself of faith that it is              only a   product of consciousness. But
the isolated doing opposed to the in-itself is a contingent doing and, as represen-
tational, a creating of fictions—representations that are not in themselves; and this
is how enlightenment regards the content of faith.—But, conversely, pure insight
---
                                                                                         .         

equally says the contrary. In affirming the moment of otherness which the concept
has within it, it pronounces faith’s essence to be something which                               in no way
concerns consciousness, lies           beyond it, is alien to it and unrecognized. The case is
similar with faith, as on the one hand it puts its trust in the essence and has the
certainty of itself     in it, while on the other hand the essence is inscrutable in all its
ways and unattainable in its Being.1
    ¶567. Further, when enlightenment regards the object of its veneration as stone
and wood, or as some other finite anthropomorphic determinacy, it asserts against
the faithful consciousness a right which the latter itself concedes. For since the
faithful consciousness is this divided consciousness, having a                        beyond    of  actuality
and a pure hither side of this beyond, there is in fact also present in it this view of the
sensory thing according to which it is valid in and for itself; but faith does not bring
together these two thoughts of what-is-in-and-for-itself, which is for it at one time the
pure essence and at another time a common sensory thing.—Even its pure conscious-
ness is affected by the latter view; for the differences of its supersensory realm,
because this lacks the concept, are a series of independent shapes and their movement
is a happening, i.e. they are only in representation and have within them the mode of
sensory Being.—Enlightenment, on its side, likewise isolates actuality as an essence
forsaken by spirit, isolates determinacy as an undisturbed finitude, as if it were not
even a moment in the spiritual movement of the essence itself, not nothing, but also
not a something that is in and for itself, but something vanishing. 1
    ¶568. It is clear that the same is the case with the ground of knowledge. The faithful
consciousness itself recognizes a contingent                 knowledge; for it has a relationship to
contingencies, and the absolute essence itself is for faith in the form of a represented
common actuality; the faithful consciousness is thereby also a certainty which does
not have the truth within itself, and it confesses to being such an unessential
consciousness, on the hither side of the self-certifying and self-verifying spirit. But
it forgets this moment in its immediate spiritual knowledge of the absolute essence.—
Enlightenment, however, which reminds it of this, in turn thinks only of contingent
knowledge and forgets the other,—thinks only of the mediation which happens
through an alien third
the third term through which it mediates itself with the other, viz. with its own self. 1term, not of the mediation in which the immediate is itself
    ¶569. Finally, enlightenment in its view of the doing of faith finds the rejection of
enjoyment and belongings wrong and purposeless.—As to the wrongness, enlight-
enment secures the agreement of the faithful consciousness in faith’s own recognition
of this actuality of possessing, holding on to, and enjoying property; in the affirm-
ation of property its behaviour is all the more isolated and stubborn, and in its
enjoyment it is all the more crudely abandoned, since its religious doing—giving up
possession and enjoyment—falls beyond this actuality and purchases its freedom for
that side of actuality. This service of sacrificing natural activities and enjoyment in
fact has, owing to this opposition, no truth; retention occurs alongside sacrifice; the
latter is merely a sign, which performs actual sacrifice in only a small portion, and it
therefore in fact only represents sacrifice. 1
    ¶570. As regards        purposiveness, enlightenment finds it inept to throw away                      one
possession in order to know and to prove that one is liberated from all possessions, to
deny oneself one enjoyment in order to know and to prove that one is liberated from
---
     (.)    

all  enjoyment. The faithful consciousness itself conceives the absolute doing as a
universal doing; for faith, not only is the action of its absolute essence as its object a
universal action, but the singular consciousness, also, is supposed to prove that it is
entirely and universally liberated from its sensory essence. But throwing away a single
possession, or renouncing a single enjoyment, is not this universal action; and since in
the action the purpose, which is a universal purpose, and the performance, which is a
single performance, would have to stand before consciousness in their essential
incompatibility, the action proves to be an action in which consciousness has no
part, and this action thereby proves to be really too naive to be an action at all; it is too
naive to fast, in order to prove that one is liberated from the pleasure of the repast,—
too naive to remove another pleasure from the body, as Origen did, in order to show
that it is done with. The action itself proves to be an external and single doing; but
desire is rooted inwardly and is a universal; its pleasure disappears neither with the
instrument nor by singular abstention.1
    ¶571. But enlightenment on its side here isolates the                     internal, the     unactual, in
contrast to actuality, just as it held fast to the externality of thinghood in contrast to
the inwardness of faith in its intuition and devotion. It places the essential in the
intention, in the       thought, and thereby spares itself the actual accomplishment of
liberation from natural purposes; on the contrary, this inwardness is itself the formal
element which has its filling in the natural impulses, which are justified simply by the
fact that they are internal, that they belong to universal Being, to nature. 1
    ¶572. Enlightenment, then, has an irresistible power over faith because the
moments which enlightenment champions are found in faith’s own consciousness.
Examining the effect of this force more closely, its behaviour towards faith seems to
dismember the          beautiful    unity of trust and immediate                certainty, to pollute its
spiritual   consciousness with base thoughts of sensory actuality, to destroy the heart
which is calmed and secure in its submission, through the vanity of the understanding
and of a will and accomplishment of its own. But in fact, enlightenment rather
introduces the sublation of the thoughtless, or rather non-conceptual, separation that
is present in faith. The faithful consciousness weighs and measures by a twofold
standard, it has two sorts of eyes, two sorts of ears, two sorts of tongue and language,
has duplicated all representations without comparing the twofold senses. Or faith
lives in two sorts of perception, one the perception of the slumbering consciousness,
living purely in non-conceptual thoughts, the other the perception of the waking
consciousness which lives purely in sensory actuality, and in each of them it manages
a particular housekeeping.—The enlightenment illuminates that heavenly world with
representations belonging to the sensory world, and points out this finitude which
faith cannot deny, because it is self-consciousness and hence is the unity to which
both modes of representation belong and in which they do not fall apart; for they
belong to the same inseparable simple Self into which faith has passed. 1
    ¶573. As a result, faith has lost the content which filled its element, and sinks down
into a listless weaving of the spirit within itself. It has been expelled from its realm, or
this realm has been ransacked, since the waking consciousness has usurped all the
differentiation and expansion of it and has vindicated earth’s ownership of every
portion of it and given them back to the earth. Yet faith is not on that account
satisfied, for this illumination has everywhere brought to light only singular essence,
---
                                                                                          .         

so that what speaks to spirit is actuality devoid of essence, and finitude forsaken by
spirit.—Since faith is without any content and it cannot remain in this void, or since,
in going beyond the finite which is the sole content, it finds only the void, it is a sheer
yearning, its truth an empty beyond, for which a fitting content can no longer be
found, for everything is otherwise engaged.—Faith has, in fact, thereby become the
same as enlightenment, viz. the consciousness of the relation of what is in itself finite
to the absolute without predicates, an absolute uncognized and uncognizable; except
that the latter      is satisfied   enlightenment, while faith is            unsatisfied     enlightenment.
However, enlightenment itself will show whether it can remain in its satisfaction; that
yearning of the troubled spirit which mourns over the loss of its spiritual world lurks
in the background. Enlightenment itself bears within it this blemish of unsatisfied
yearning,—as pure object in its empty absolute essence,—as doing and movement in
going beyond        its singular-essence to the unfilled beyond,—as a                   filled object in the
selflessness    of the useful. Enlightenment will sublate this blemish; from a closer
examination of the positive result, which to it is the truth, it will emerge that in
that result the blemish is in itself already sublated.1
b. The truth of enlightenment
¶574. Spirit’s listless weaving, no longer differentiating anything within itself, has
thus entered into its own self beyond consciousness, while consciousness, on the
other hand, has become clear to itself. The first moment of this clarity is determined
in its necessity and its condition by the fact that pure insight, or insight that is                          in
itself  concept, actualizes itself; it does so when it posits otherness or determinacy
within itself. In this way it is negative pure insight, i.e. negation of the concept; this
negation is equally pure; and thus there has come about the pure thing, the absolute
essence, that has no further determination whatever. Determined more precisely,
pure insight, as absolute concept, is a differentiation of differences which are no
longer differences, of abstractions or pure concepts which are no longer self-
supporting, but have support and differentiation only through the                            movement as a
whole. This differentiation of the non-differentiated consists simply in the fact that
the absolute concept makes itself into its               object   and posits itself as the essence         over
against that     movement. Because of this, the essence lacks the side in which abstrac-
tions or differences are          held apart from each other, and therefore becomes                        pure
thinking as pure thing.—This, then, is just that listless, unconscious weaving of spirit
within itself to which faith sank down when it lost the differentiated content;—it is at
the same time that          movement       of pure self-consciousness for which the essence is
supposed to be the absolutely alien beyond. For because this pure self-consciousness
is the movement in pure concepts, in differences that are not differences, it in fact
collapses into unconscious weaving, i.e. into pure feeling or pure thinghood.—The self-
alienated concept—for the concept here still stands at the stage of this alienation—
does not, however, recognize this like essence of the two sides, of the movement of self-
consciousness and of its absolute essence, does not recognize their like essence which
is, in fact, their substance and subsistence. Since the concept does not recognize this
unity, the essence counts for it only in the form of the objective beyond, while the
differentiating consciousness, which in this way has the in-itself outside it, counts as a
finite consciousness.1

     (.)   

   ¶575. In regard to that absolute essence, enlightenment gets caught up in the same
conflict with itself that it formerly had with faith, and it divides into two parties.
A party proves itself to be the victor by splitting into two parties; for in so doing, it
shows that it possesses within itself the principle that it combated, and thus has
sublated the one-sidedness in which it previously entered the scene. The interest
which was divided between itself and the other party now falls entirely within itself
and forgets the other party, because that interest                  finds within itself the opposition
that occupies it. At the same time, however, the opposition has been raised into the
higher victorious element in which it presents itself purified. So that therefore the
schism that arises in a party, which seems to be a misfortune, demonstrates rather
that party’s good fortune. 1
   ¶576. The pure essence itself has no difference in it; therefore the way in which
difference comes into it is that there emerge two such pure essences for conscious-
ness, or a twofold consciousness of the essence.—The pure absolute essence is only in
pure thinking, or rather it is pure thinking itself, therefore utterly beyond the finite,
beyond self-consciousness, and is only the negative essence. But in this way it is just
Being, the negative of self-consciousness. As the negative                    of self-consciousness it is
also  related to it; it is the outer Being            which, related to self-consciousness within
which the differences and determinations fall, acquires within it the differences of
being tasted, seen, etc.; and the relationship is sensory certainty and perception. 1
   ¶577. If we start from this sensory Being into which that negative beyond neces-
sarily passes, but abstract from these determinate modes of the relation of conscious-
ness, then what remains is pure              matter    as the listless weaving and moving within
itself. In this connection, it is essential to consider that pure matter is merely what is
left over when we abstract from seeing, feeling, tasting, etc., i.e. it is not what is seen,
felt, tasted, etc.; what is seen, felt, tasted, is not matter, but colour, a stone, a salt, etc.;
matter is rather the        pure abstraction, and so what is present is the pure essence of
thinking, or pure thinking itself as the intrinsically undifferentiated, undetermined,
predicateless absolute.1
   ¶578. One of the enlightenments calls the absolute essence that predicateless
absolute which lies beyond actual consciousness in the thinking from which we
started out; the other enlightenment calls it matter. If these were to be distinguished
as nature and spirit or God, then the unconscious weaving within itself would lack
the wealth of unfolded life for it to be nature, and spirit or God would lack self-
differentiating consciousness. The two, as we saw, are simply the same concept; the
difference lies not in the Thing, but simply and solely in the diverse starting-points of
the two formations, and in the fact that each stops short at a point of its own in the
movement of thinking. If they were to disregard their starting- and stopping-points
they would coincide and would recognize that what to the one is, so it pretends, an
abomination, and what to the other is a folly, are the same thing. For to the one, the
absolute essence is in its pure thinking, or is immediately for pure consciousness, is
outside finite consciousness, the negative beyond of it. If it were to reflect, first, that
that simple immediacy of thinking is nothing other than pure Being, and secondly,
that what is     negative for consciousness is at the same time related to it, that in the
negative judgement the ‘is’          (copula) holds together the two separated terms,—then
the relation of this beyond to consciousness would reveal itself in the determination
---
                                                                                           .         

of an external being, and herewith as the same thing as what is called pure matter; the
missing moment of presence would be gained.—The other enlightenment sets out
from sensory Being, then abstracts from the sensory relation of tasting, seeing, etc.,
and makes that Being into a pure in-itself, into absolute matter, into what is neither
felt nor tasted; this Being has in this way become the predicateless simple, the essence
of pure consciousness; it is the pure concept as being in itself, or pure thinking within
itself. This insight does not in its consciousness take the opposite step from the being,
which is purely a being, to what is thought, which is the same as the pure being, or it
does not take the step from the purely positive to the purely negative; when, after all,
the positive is pure solely through negation, while the pure negative, as pure, is within
its own self like itself and just for that reason positive.—Or neither of them has
arrived at the concept of Descartes’s metaphysics, that                      Being    and   thinking     are,  in
themselves, the same, at the thought that Being, pure Being, is not something concrete
and actual, but pure abstraction, and conversely, pure thinking, likeness-to-itself or
the essence, is partly the negative of self-consciousness and therefore Being, partly, as
immediate simplicity, is likewise nothing other than Being; thinking is thinghood, or
thinghood is thinking.1
   ¶579. Here the essence has division in it only in such a way that it pertains to two
different ways of considering it; on the one hand, the essence must have difference
within itself; on the other, just in this respect, the two ways of considering it merge
together into one; for the abstract moments of pure Being and the negative, by which
they are differentiated, are then united in the object of these modes of consideration.—
The universal common to both is the abstraction of pure vibration within itself, or of
pure self-thinking. This simple movement, revolving on an axis, must burst asunder
because it is itself only movement when it differentiates its moments. This differ-
entiation of the moments leaves behind the unmoved as the empty husk of pure
Being, which is no longer any actual thinking, no longer any life within itself; for this
differentiation is, as difference, all the content. This differentiation, however, which
posits itself outside that unity, is herewith an alternation of the moments which does
not return into itself, an alternation of                Being-in-itself      and of     Being-for-an-other
and of Being-for-itself;—actuality, as it is object for the actual consciousness of pure
insight,—utility.1
   ¶580. Bad as utility may look to faith or sentimentality, or even to the abstraction
calling itself speculation, which clings to the                in-itself, yet it is in utility that pure
insight achieves its realization and has itself for its object, an object which it now no
longer repudiates and which, too, does not have for it the value of the void or of the
pure beyond. For pure insight is, as we saw, the concept itself in being, or the pure
personality equal to itself, differentiating itself within itself in such a way that each of
the differentiated items is itself pure concept, i.e. is immediately not differentiated;
pure insight is simple, pure self-consciousness which is for itself as well as in itself in
an immediate unity. Its Being-in-itself is therefore not enduring Being, but immedi-
ately ceases to be anything in its difference; such a Being, however, that immediately
has no support, is not in itself, but essentially for an other, which is the power that
absorbs it. But this second moment, opposed to the                           first, to the     Being-in-itself,
vanishes just as immediately as the first; or as                 Being only for other, it is rather the
vanishing itself, and there is posited the having-returned into itself, the Being-for-itself.
---
     (.)   

This simple Being-for-itself, however, as likeness-to-itself, is rather                           a Being, or
thereby for an other.—This nature of pure insight in the                       unfolding of its moments,
or pure insight as        object, is expressed in the useful. What is useful, is something
subsisting    in itself   or a thing, this Being-in-itself is at the same time only a pure
moment; hence it is absolutely for an other, but is only for an other inasmuch as it is
in itself; these opposed moments have returned into the inseparable unity of Being-
for-itself. But while the useful does express the concept of pure insight, it is not pure
insight as such but insight as            representation       or as its   object; it is only the restless
alternation of those moments, one of which is indeed the having-returned into itself,
but only as Being-for-itself, i.e. as an abstract moment stepping aside in the face of the
other moments. The useful itself is not the negative essence, having in itself these
moments, in their opposition, at the same time                      unseparated      in one    and    the same
regard or having them as a thinking, such as they are as pure insight; the moment of
Being-for-itself is certainly in the useful, but not in such a way that it overarches the
other moments, the in-itself and Being for other, in which case it would be the Self. In
the useful, therefore, pure insight has its own concept in its pure moments for object;
it is the consciousness of this metaphysics, but not as yet the comprehension of it;
consciousness has not yet reached the unity of Being and the concept itself. Since the
useful still has the form of an object for pure insight, pure insight does have a world,
no longer of course a world that is in and for itself, but still a world all the same, which
it differentiates from itself. Yet since the oppositions have mounted to the summit
of the concept, the next stage will be their collapse and enlightenment’s experiencing
the fruits of its deeds.1
    ¶581. Looking at the object attained in relation to this whole sphere, we see that
the actual world of culture concentrated itself in the vanity of self-consciousness,—in
the Being-for-itself which still has the confusion of the world of culture as its content
and is still the     singular    concept, not yet the concept that is for itself universal. But
returned into itself, that concept is pure insight,—pure consciousness as the pure Self
or negativity, just as faith is pure consciousness as pure thinking or positivity. In that
Self, faith has the moment that makes it complete;—but it goes to ruin through this
completion, and it is now in pure insight that we see the two moments, as the
absolute essence which is purely in thought or the negative, and as matter, which is
the positive being.—This completeness still lacks that actuality of self-consciousness
which belongs to the vain consciousness,—the world out of which thinking raised
itself to itself. What it lacks is attained in utility insofar as pure insight obtained
positive objectivity in it; pure insight is thereby an actual consciousness satisfied
within itself. This objectivity now constitutes its world; it has become the truth of the
entire preceding world, of the ideal, as well as of the real, world. The first world of
spirit is the expansive realm of its self-dispersing Being-there and of the singularized
certainty of itself; just as nature disperses its life into infinitely various shapes, in the
absence of the genus of those shapes. The second world of spirit contains the genus
and is the realm of Being-in-itself or of the truth in opposition to that certainty. But
the third realm, the useful, is the truth which is equally the certainty of itself. The
realm of the truth of faith lacks the principle of actuality, or certainty of oneself as
this singleton. But the actuality or the certainty of oneself as this singleton lacks the
in-itself. In the object of pure insight both worlds are united. The useful is the object,
---
                                                                                           .         

insofar as self-consciousness sees right through it and has in it the singular certainty
of itself, its enjoyment (its Being-for-itself ); in this way self-consciousness sees into
the object, and this insight contains the               true essence of the object (which is to be
something that is seen through or to be for an other); this insight is thus itself true
knowing, and self-consciousness has just as immediately the universal certainty of
itself, its pure consciousness, in this relationship, in which                  truth as well as presence
and actuality are thus united. The two worlds are reconciled and heaven is trans-
planted to the earth below.1

¶582. Consciousness has found its concept in utility. But the concept is first still an
object, and secondly, for that very reason, still a purpose, of which consciousness does
not yet find itself in immediate possession. Utility is still a predicate of the object, not
itself a subject or the immediate and sole actuality of the object. It is the same thing
that appeared before, that is, that               Being-for-itself     has not yet proved to be the
substance of the remaining moments, whereby the useful would immediately be
nothing other than the Self of consciousness and the latter would thereby be in
possession of it.—This withdrawal of the form of objectivity of the useful has,
however, already happened in itself, and from this inner revolution there emerges
the actual revolution of actuality, the new shape of consciousness, absolute freedom. 1
   ¶583. That is to say, there is in fact present no more than an empty semblance of
objectivity, separating self-consciousness from possession. For, on the one hand, all
subsistence and validity of the determinate members of the organization of the actual
world and the world of faith have, in general, returned into this simple determination
as into their ground and spirit; but on the other hand, this simple determination no
longer has anything of its own for itself, it is rather pure metaphysics, pure concept or
knowledge of self-consciousness. That is to say, of the Being-in-and-for-itself of the
useful as object, consciousness recognizes that its Being-in-itself                     is essentially Being
for another; Being-in-itself, as the selfless, is in truth the passive Self, or that which is a
Self for another Self. The object, however, is for consciousness in this abstract form of
pure Being-in-itself, for consciousness is a pure act of insightfulness whose differences
are in the pure form of concepts.—But the Being-for-itself into which Being for an
other returns, the Self, is not a Self distinct from the I, the very own Self of what is
called object; for consciousness, as pure insight, is not a singular Self confronted by
the object as equally a Self of its own, but it is the pure concept, the gazing of the Self
into the Self, the absolute seeing of itself doubled; the certainty of itself is the universal
subject, and its knowing concept is the essence of all actuality. If, then, the useful was
merely the alternation of the moments, an alternation which did not return into its
own    unity, and hence was still an object for knowing, it ceases to be this; for the
knowing is itself the movement of those abstract moments, it is the universal Self,
the Self of itself as well as of the object and, as universal, it is the unity, returning into
itself, of this movement.1
   ¶584. With this, spirit is at hand as absolute freedom; spirit is the self-consciousness
which grasps the fact that its certainty of itself is the essence of all the spiritual
masses, of the real as well as of the supersensory world, or conversely, that essence
and actuality are consciousness’s knowledge of                     itself.—It is conscious of its pure
---

personality and therein of all spiritual reality, and all reality is solely the spiritual;
the world is for it simply its own will, and this is universal will. And what is more,
this will is not the empty thought of the will that is posited in silent consent or
consent through a representative, but a really universal will, the will of all singletons
as such. For the will is in itself the consciousness of personality, or of each one, and
it is as this genuine actual will that it ought to be, as the                  self-conscious essence of
each and every personality, so that each, undivided from the whole, always does
everything, and what enters the scene as doing of the whole is the immediate and
conscious doing of each one. 1
   ¶585. This undivided substance of absolute freedom ascends the throne of the
world without any power being able to offer resistance to it. For since, in truth,
consciousness alone is the element in which the spiritual essences or powers have
their substance, their entire system, which organized and maintained itself by
division into masses, has collapsed, now that the singular consciousness conceives
the object as having no other essence than self-consciousness itself, or as being
absolutely the concept. What made the concept into an                           object   in being, was its
differentiation into separate           subsistent     masses; but when the object becomes a
concept, there is no longer anything subsisting in it; negativity has permeated all
its moments. It comes into existence in such a way that each singular consciousness
raises itself out of its allotted sphere, no longer finds its essence and its work in this
particular mass, but grasps its Self as the concept of will, grasps all masses as the
essence of this will, and therefore can also only actualize itself in a labour which is a
total labour. In this absolute freedom, therefore, all estates, which are the spiritual
essences into which the whole articulates itself, are abolished; the singular conscious-
ness that belonged to such a member, and willed and accomplished in it, has sublated
its limitation; its purpose is the universal purpose, its language universal law, its work
the universal work.1
   ¶586. The object and the difference have here lost the significance of utility, which
was the predicate of all real Being; consciousness does not begin its movement in the
object as if this were something alien from which it first returned into itself, but on
the contrary, the object is for it consciousness itself; the opposition consists, there-
fore, solely in the difference between the singular and the                     universal    consciousness;
but the singular consciousness itself is immediately in its own eyes that which had
only the semblance of opposition, it is universal consciousness and will. The beyond
of this actuality of consciousness hovers over the corpse of the vanished independ-
ence of real Being, or the Being of faith, merely as the exhalation of a stale gas, of the
vacuous être suprême.1
   ¶587. After the sublation of the different spiritual masses and of the restricted life
of the individuals, as well as of this life’s two worlds, all that is present, then, is the
movement of universal self-consciousness within itself as an interaction between self-
consciousness in the form of universality and in the form of personal consciousness;
the universal will goes into itself and is singular will, confronted by the universal law
and work. But this singular consciousness is no less immediately conscious of itself as
universal will; it is conscious that its object is a law given by that will and a work
accomplished by it; therefore, in passing over into action and in creating objectivity,
it is effecting nothing singular, but only laws and State-actions.
---
                                                                                          .        

    ¶588. This movement is thus the interaction of consciousness with itself in which
it lets nothing break loose in the shape of a free object confronting it. It follows from
this that it cannot arrive at any positive work, neither universal works of language nor
of actuality, neither at laws and universal arrangements of conscious freedom, nor at
deeds and works of           willing   freedom.—The work to which the freedom acquiring
consciousness could devote itself, would consist in that freedom, as                         universal sub-
stance, making itself into an object and enduring Being. This otherness would be the
difference in freedom whereby it divided itself into subsisting spiritual masses and
into members of various powers; such that these masses would, on the one hand, be
the thought-things of a power divided into legislative, judicial, and executive power,
but on the other hand the real essences that emerged in the real world of culture, and,
when the content of the universal doing was given closer attention, they would be the
particular masses of labour, which are further differentiated as more specific
estates.—The universal freedom, which would have separated itself in this way into
its members and by the very fact of doing so would have made itself into a substance
in being, would thereby be free from singular individuality, and would divide the
multitude of individuals among its various members. But the doing and Being of the
personality would thereby find itself restricted to a branch of the whole, to one kind
of doing and Being; posited in the element of Being, personality would receive the
significance of a determinate personality; it would cease to be in truth universal self-
consciousness. Neither by the              representation       of obedience under           self-given   laws
which would assign it a share, nor by its representation-by-proxy in law-giving and
universal doing, does self-consciousness let itself be cheated out of                        actuality,—the
actuality of     itself making the law and accomplishing, not a singular work, but the
universal itself; for where the Self is merely represented-by-proxy and is represented,
there it is not actual; where it is deputized for, it is not. 1
    ¶589. Just as the singular self-consciousness does not find itself in this universal
work of absolute freedom as substance that is-there, no more does it find itself in the
real deeds and       individual     actions of the will of this freedom. For the universal to
arrive at a deed it must concentrate itself into the One of individuality and put at
the head a singular self-consciousness; for the universal will is only an actual will in
a Self that is One. But all other singletons are thereby excluded from the entirety of
this deed and have only a limited share in it, so that the deed would not be a deed of
the actual universal self-consciousness.—Universal freedom, therefore, can produce
no positive work or deed; there remains for it only negative doing; it is merely the
fury of evanescence. 1
    ¶590. But the supreme actuality and the actuality most opposed to universal
freedom, or rather the sole object that that freedom still has, is the freedom and
singularity of actual self-consciousness itself. For that universality which cannot
bring itself to advance to the reality of organic articulation, and whose purpose is
to maintain itself in unbroken continuity, at the same time differentiates itself within
itself, because it is movement or consciousness in general. And, indeed, by virtue of
its own abstraction, it separates into extremes equally abstract, into the simple,
inflexible, cold universality, and the discrete, absolute, hard rigidity and self-willed
punctuality of actual self-consciousness. Now that it has completed the destruction of
the real organization, and now subsists for itself, this is its sole object—an object that
---
     (.)   

no longer has any other content, possession, Being-there, or external expansion, but
is merely this knowledge of itself as an absolutely pure and free singular Self. The only
handle for getting a grip on it is its abstract Being-there in general.—The relationship,
then, of these two, since they are indivisibly absolute for themselves, and thus cannot
admit any part as a middle term, whereby they would be linked together, is wholly
unmediated pure negation, the negation, moreover, of the singleton as a being in the
universal. The sole work and deed of universal freedom is therefore                           death, a death
moreover which has no inner range and filling; for what is negated is the empty point
of the absolutely free Self; it is thus the coldest and meanest of all deaths, with no
more significance than cutting off a head of cabbage or a mouthful of water. 1
   ¶591. In the banality of this syllable consists the wisdom of the government, the
understanding of the universal will of the way to accomplish itself. The government is
itself nothing other than the self-establishing focal point or the individuality of the
universal will. The government, a willing and accomplishing, that proceeds from a
point, at the same time wills and accomplishes a determinate order and action. With
this, on the one hand it excludes the other individuals from its deed, and on the other
hand, it thereby constitutes itself as a government that is a determinate will, and so
stands opposed to the universal will; consequently, it is downright impossible for it to
present itself as anything other than a faction. What is called government is merely
the victorious faction, and in the very fact of its being a faction lies immediately the
necessity of its downfall; and its being the government makes it, conversely, into a
faction and guilty. If the universal will insists on the government’s actual actions as
the crime that it has committed against it, the government, in return, has nothing
determinate and tangible by which the guilt of the will opposed to it could be
exposed; for what stands opposed to it, as to the actual universal will, is only unactual
pure will,    intention. Falling-under-suspicion, therefore, takes the place, or has the
significance and effect, of being guilty; and the external reaction against this actuality
that lies in the simple interior of intention, consists in the dry extermination of this
Self in being, from which nothing else can be taken away except only its very Being.1
   ¶592. In this work peculiar to it, absolute freedom becomes its own object, and
self-consciousness experiences what absolute freedom                         is. In itself, it is just this
abstract self-consciousness, which effaces all difference and all subsistence of differ-
ence within itself. It is as such that it is an object to itself; the terror of death is the
intuition of this negative essence of freedom. But absolutely free self-consciousness
finds this reality of itself quite different from what its concept of itself was, viz. that
the universal will would be merely the                  positive    essence of personality, and that
personality would know itself in it only positively or as preserved. Here, however,
this self-consciousness which, as pure insight, simply separates its positive and its
negative essence—the predicateless absolute as pure thinking and the predicateless
absolute as pure matter—finds itself confronted with the absolute transition of the
one into the other in its actuality.—The universal will, as absolutely positive, actual
self-consciousness, because it is this self-conscious actuality elevated to pure think-
ing or to abstract matter, changes round into the negative essence and proves to be
equally the sublation of thinking-of-oneself, or of self-consciousness. 1
   ¶593. Absolute freedom, as pure equality-with-itself of the universal will, thus has
within it    negation, but thereby         difference in general, and it develops this again as
---
                                                                                          .         

actual difference. For pure negativity has in the self-equal universal will the element
of subsistence, or the substance in which its moments realize themselves; it has the
matter which it can convert into its own determinacy; and insofar as this substance
has shown itself to be the negative for the singular consciousness, the organization of
spiritual masses, to which the multitude of individual consciousnesses are assigned,
thus cultivates itself again. These consciousnesses, which have felt the fear of death, of
their absolute master, again submit to negation and differences, arrange themselves
among the masses, and turn back to an apportioned and limited work, but thereby
back to their substantial actuality.1
   ¶594. Out of this tumult, spirit would be thrown back to its starting-point, to the
ethical and real world of culture, which would have been merely refreshed and
rejuvenated by the fear of the master which has again entered men’s hearts. Spirit
would have to traverse anew and continually repeat this cycle of necessity if the result
were only the complete interpenetration of self-consciousness and substance—an
interpenetration in which self-consciousness, which has experienced the negative
force of its universal essence against it, would want to know and                         find itself, not as
this particular, but only as a universal, and therefore could also endure the objective
actuality of universal spirit, an actuality excluding self-consciousness as a particular.—
But in absolute freedom there was no reciprocal action between a consciousness that is
immersed in manifold Being-there or that sets itself determinate purposes and
thoughts, and a valid outer world, whether of actuality or of thinking, but between a
world purely and simply in the form of consciousness, as universal will, and likewise a
self-consciousness drawn together out of all expansive Being-there or manifold pur-
pose and judgement, and into the simple Self. The culture which self-consciousness
achieves in interaction with that essence is, therefore, the grandest and the last, is that of
seeing its pure, simple actuality immediately vanish and pass away into empty noth-
ingness. In the world of culture itself self-consciousness does not get as far as intuiting
its negation or alienation in this form of pure abstraction; on the contrary, its negation
is the filled negation, either honour or wealth, which it gains in place of the Self that it
has alienated from itself;—or the language of spirit and of insight which the dismem-
bered consciousness acquires; or its negation is the heaven of faith, or the utility of the
enlightenment. All these determinations have been shed in the loss experienced by
the Self in absolute freedom; its negation is the meaningless death, the pure terror of
the negative that contains nothing positive, nothing that fills it.—At the same time,
however, this negation in its actuality is not something alien; it is neither the universal
necessity lying beyond, in which the ethical world perishes, nor the singular contin-
gence of private possession or of the whim of the possessor on which the dismembered
consciousness sees itself dependent,—on the contrary, it is the universal will, which in
this its ultimate abstraction has nothing positive and therefore can give nothing in
return for the sacrifice;—but for that very reason the will is unmediatedly one with self-
consciousness, or it is the purely positive, because it is the purely negative; and the
meaningless death, the unfilled negativity of the Self, veers round in the inner concept
into absolute positivity. For consciousness, the immediate unity of itself with the
universal will, its demand to know itself as this determinate point in the universal
will, is transformed into the utterly opposite experience. What vanishes for it in that
experience is the abstract Being or the immediacy of the insubstantial point, and this
---
     (.)   

vanished immediacy is the universal will itself, which it now knows itself to be,
insofar as it is     sublated immediacy, insofar as it is pure knowing or pure will. It
thereby knows that will as itself, and knows itself as essence, but not as the essence
immediately in being; it does not know the will as the revolutionary government
or as anarchy striving to constitute anarchy, nor itself as the centre of this faction
or of the opposing faction, but on the contrary, the                         universal will      is its  pure
knowing and willing and            consciousness is the universal will, as this pure knowing
and willing. It does not lose itself in that will, for the pure knowing and willing is
much more itself than is the atomic point of consciousness. It is thus the
interaction of pure knowing with itself; pure                  knowing      as essence is the universal
will; but this essence is purely and simply only pure knowing. Self-consciousness
is, therefore, the pure knowing of the essence as pure knowing. Further, as
singular Self, it is only the form of the subject or of actual doing, a form that is
known by it as form; similarly,             objective    actuality, Being, is for it simply selfless
form, for that actuality would be the unknown; this knowing, however, knows
knowing as the essence.1
   ¶595. Absolute freedom has thus equalized the opposition of the universal will
and the singular will with itself; the self-alienated spirit, driven to the extreme of its
opposition, in which pure willing and what purely wills are still differentiated,
reduces the opposition to a transparent form and                     finds itself therein.—Just as the
realm of the actual world passes over into the realm of faith and insight, so does
absolute freedom pass from its self-destroying actuality and over into another land of
self-conscious spirit where, in this unactuality, freedom counts as the true; in the
thought of this truth spirit refreshes itself, insofar as spirit is                and remains thought,
and knows this Being which is enclosed in self-consciousness as the complete and
perfect essence. There has arisen the new shape, that of the moral spirit. 1
C. Spirit certain of itself. Morality
¶596. The ethical world showed the merely departed spirit in it, the singular Self, to be
its destiny and its truth. This             person of right, however, has its substance and
fulfilment outside the ethical world. The movement of the world of culture and of
faith sublates this abstraction of the person, and through the completed alienation,
through the ultimate abstraction, substance becomes for the Self of spirit at first the
universal will, and       finally property of spirit’s own. Here, then, knowledge seems at
last to have become completely equal to its truth; for its truth is this very knowledge,
and all opposition between the two sides has vanished, vanished not for us or in itself,
but for self-consciousness itself. That is to say, self-consciousness has gained mastery
over the opposition of consciousness itself. This consciousness rests on the oppos-
ition between the certainty of itself and the object; but now the object is for
consciousness itself the certainty of itself, knowledge—just as the certainty of itself
as such no longer has purposes of its own, is therefore no longer within determinacy,
but is pure knowledge.1
   ¶597. Thus for self-consciousness, its knowledge is the substance itself. For it, this
substance is, in an indivisible unity, just as immediate as absolutely mediated. It is
immediate—like the ethical consciousness, it knows its duty and does it itself, and
belongs to this duty as to its own nature; but self-consciousness is not character, as
---
                                                                                       .        

the ethical consciousness is, which on account of its immediacy is a determinate
spirit, belongs to only one of the ethical essentialities, and has the side                          of not
knowing.—The consciousness of this substance is                      absolute mediation, as are the
self-cultivating consciousness and the faithful consciousness; for it is essentially the
movement of the Self, consisting in sublating the abstraction of immediate Being-
there and becoming a universal to itself;—yet neither through pure alienation and
dismemberment of itself and of actuality,—nor by flight. Rather, it is immediately
present to itself in its substance, for this substance is its knowledge, it is the intuited
pure certainty of itself; and just          this immediacy, which is its own actuality, is all
actuality, for the immediate is Being itself and, as pure immediacy refined by absolute
negativity, this immediacy is Being in general, or all Being. 1
   ¶598. The absolute essence is therefore not exhausted in the determination of
being the simple essence of thinking, but it is all actuality, and this actuality is only as
knowledge; what consciousness did not know would have no sense for consciousness
and can be no power for it; into its knowing will all objectivity and all the world have
withdrawn. It is absolutely free in that it knows its freedom, and just this knowledge
of its freedom is its substance and purpose and sole content.1
.     -
¶599. Self-consciousness knows duty as the absolute essence; it is bound only by
duty, and this substance is its own pure consciousness; for it duty cannot acquire
the form of something alien. However, enclosed within itself in this way, moral
self-consciousness is not yet posited and considered as consciousness. The object is
immediate knowledge and, permeated in this way purely by the Self, is not an
object. But self-consciousness, essentially mediation and negativity, has in its
concept the relation to an otherness and is consciousness. This otherness, because
duty constitutes its sole essential purpose and object, is, on the one hand, an
actuality    completely       without significance         for consciousness. But because               this
consciousness is so completely enclosed within itself, it behaves with perfect
freedom and indifference towards this otherness, and therefore Being-there, on
the other hand, is a Being-there left completely free by self-consciousness, likewise
related only to itself; the freer self-consciousness becomes, the freer also is the
negative object of its consciousness. The object is thereby a world completed
within itself to an individuality of its own, an independent whole of laws peculiar
to itself, as well as an independent operation of those laws, and a free actualization
of them—in general, a            nature    whose laws like its doing belong to itself, as an
essence that is unconcerned about moral self-consciousness, just as the latter is
unconcerned about it.1
   ¶600. From this determination a moral world-view is cultivated, which consists in
the relation between the moral Being-in-and-for-itself and the natural Being-in-and-
for-itself. At the basis of this relation lies, on the one hand, the complete indifference
and exclusive independence           of  nature and that of       moral purposes       and activity with
respect to each other, and, on the other hand, the consciousness of the exclusive
essentiality of duty and of the utter dependence and inessentiality of nature. The
moral world-view contains the development of the moments which are present in
this relation of such entirely conflicting presuppositions.1
---
     (.)    

    ¶601. To begin with, then, the moral consciousness in general is presupposed; duty
counts as the essence for this consciousness, a consciousness that is actual and active,
and in its actuality and deed fulfils its duty. But at the same time the presupposed
freedom of nature is for this consciousness, or it learns                     by experience that nature
is not concerned with giving it the consciousness of the unity of its actuality with that
of nature, and hence that nature perhaps lets it become happy, or perhaps not. The
immoral consciousness, by contrast,                 finds, perhaps by chance, its actualization,
where the moral consciousness sees only an                    occasion for acting, but does not see
the happiness of performance and the enjoyment of achievement falling to its lot
through this action. Therefore, it             finds rather ground for complaint about such a
state of discrepancy between itself and Being-there, and of the injustice which
restricts it to having its object merely as pure duty, but refuses to let it see the object
and itself actualized. 1
    ¶602. The moral consciousness cannot renounce happiness and leave this moment
out of its absolute purpose. The purpose, which is expressed as pure duty, essentially
involves that it contains this          singular self-consciousness; individual conviction                 and
the knowledge of it constituted an absolute moment of morality. This moment in the
purpose that has become objective, in the fulfilled duty, is the singular consciousness
intuiting itself as actualized, or enjoyment, which is thus involved in the concept of
morality, not indeed immediately of morality regarded as                          disposition, but in the
concept of its actualization. In virtue of this, however, enjoyment is also involved in
morality as disposition; for this sets out not to remain disposition in contrast to
action, but to act or to actualize itself. Thus the purpose, expressed as the whole with
the consciousness of its moments, is that the fulfilled duty be a purely moral action as
well as realized individuality, and that nature, as the side of singularity confronting
the abstract purpose, be one with this purpose.—Necessary as the experience is of the
disharmony of the two sides, because nature is free, even so, duty alone is what is
essential, and nature by contrast with it is what is selfless. That whole purpose, which
is constituted by the harmony, contains within it actuality itself. It is at the same time
the   thought    of  actuality. The harmony of morality and nature,—or, since nature
comes into consideration only insofar as consciousness experiences its unity with
it,—the harmony of morality and happiness, is thought of as being necessarily, or it is
postulated. For demanding expresses that something that is not yet actual is thought
of as being; a necessity not of the concept as concept, but of Being. But necessity is at
the same time essentially a relation in virtue of the concept. The                            Being    that is
demanded, then, belongs not to the representation of contingent consciousness,
but it lies in the concept of morality itself, whose true content is the unity                          of the
pure and the singular consciousness; it pertains to the singular consciousness that this
unity be for it as an actuality, which in the content of the purpose is happiness, but in
the form of the purpose is Being-there in general.—This demanded Being-there, or
the unity of both, is therefore not a wish or, regarded as purpose, not the sort of
purpose whose attainment is still uncertain, but rather a demand of reason, or an
immediate certainty and presupposition of reason.1
    ¶603. This first experience and this postulate are not the only ones, but a whole
circle of postulates opens up. Nature, that is to say, is not merely this wholly free
external mode, in which, as a pure object, consciousness has to realize its purpose.

                                                                                          .         

This consciousness is, within its own self, essentially a consciousness for which there
is this other free actuality, i.e. consciousness is itself something contingent and
natural. This nature, which is to consciousness its own nature, is                        sensibility, which
in the   shape    of volition, as      impulses    and   inclinations, has for itself a          determinate
essentiality of its own, or singular purposes, and so is opposed to the pure will and its
pure purpose. However, in contrast to this opposition, it is, to pure consciousness,
rather the relation of sensibility to it, its absolute unity with it, that is the essence.
Both of these, pure thinking and the sensibility of consciousness, are in themselves
one consciousness, and it is precisely pure thinking for which and in which this pure
unity is; but as consciousness, what is for it is the opposition of itself and the
impulses. In this conflict of reason and sensibility, for reason the essence is that the
conflict resolve itself and that, as a            result, the unity of the two emerge, not that
original   unity in which both are in one individual, but a unity that emerges from
the  known     opposition of the two. Only such a unity is actual                     morality, for in it is
contained the opposition whereby the Self is consciousness or is, only now, an actual
Self, a Self in fact, and at the same time a universal; or in that unity there is expressed
that mediation which, as we see, is essential to morality.—Since, of the two moments
of the opposition, sensibility is sheer otherness, or the negative, while, on the other
hand, the pure thinking of duty is the essence, nothing of which can be abandoned, it
seems that the unity produced can only come about by the sublation of sensibility.
But since sensibility is itself a moment of this becoming, the moment of actuality, we
have to be content, initially, with expressing the unity by saying that sensibility is in
conformity with morality.—This unity is likewise a postulated Being, it is not there; for
what   is there is consciousness, or the opposition of sensibility and pure conscious-
ness. But at the same time, the unity is not an in-itself, like the                       first postulate, in
which free nature constitutes one side of the unity, and in consequence the harmony
of nature with the moral consciousness falls outside the unity; on the contrary, nature
here is that nature which is within consciousness itself, and here we have to do with
morality as such, with a harmony that is the very own harmony of the acting Self;
consciousness has, therefore, itself to bring this harmony about, and to be making
continuous progress in morality. But the completion of morality has to be postponed
to infinity; for if it actually came about, then the moral consciousness would sublate
itself. For morality is only moral consciousness as the negative essence, and for the
pure duty of this essence sensibility has only a negative significance, is merely not in
conformity. But in the harmony,               morality    as consciousness, or morality’s actuality,
vanishes, just as in the moral consciousness, or in the actuality, its harmony vanishes.
The completion, therefore, is not actually attainable, but is to be thought of only as an
absolute task, i.e. as a task that simply remains a task. Yet at the same time its content
has to be thought of as a content that simply must be, and not remain a task; whether
we represent the consciousness to be altogether sublated in this goal, or not; which
alternative we should really adopt in this case can no longer be clearly distinguished
in the dim remoteness of infinity, to which for that very reason the attainment of the
goal is to be postponed. Strictly speaking, we shall have to say that the determinate
representation on this point ought not to be of interest and ought not to be sought,
because this leads to contradictions,—of a task that ought to remain a task and yet be
fulfilled,—of a morality that is supposed to be no longer consciousness, no longer

actual. But the consideration that perfected morality would contain a contradiction
would impair the sanctity of the moral essentiality and make absolute duty appear as
something unactual.1
    ¶604. The first postulate was the harmony of morality and objective nature, the
final purpose of the world; the other, the harmony of morality and the sensory will, is
the final purpose of self-consciousness as such; the first, then, is harmony in the form
of  Being-in-itself, the other, in the form of              Being-for-itself. But what connects, as
middle term, these two extreme final purposes that are thought, is the movement of
actual action itself. They are harmonies whose moments, in their abstract differen-
tiation, have not yet become objects; this happens in the actuality in which the sides
emerge in consciousness proper, each as the other of the other. Whereas previously
the postulates contained the harmonies only separated, as being respectively in itself
and for itself, the postulates that have arisen in this way now contain harmonies that
are in and for themselves1.
    ¶605. The moral consciousness as the                simple knowing        and willing of pure         duty
is, in acting, related to the object opposed to its simplicity, related to the actuality
of the    multifaceted case, and thereby has a multifaceted moral                      relationship. Here
there arise, regarding content, the multiple laws in general and, regarding form, the
contradictory powers of the knowing consciousness and of the non-conscious.—In
the first place, as regards the multiple duties, what is valid for the moral conscious-
ness in general is only the pure duty in them; the                    multiple duties as multiple are
determinate and therefore as such are nothing sacred for the moral consciousness.
At the same time, however, since they are necessary in virtue of the concept of acting,
which involves a multifaceted actuality and therefore a multifaceted moral relation,
these multiple duties must be regarded as being in and for themselves. Further, since
they can be only in a moral             consciousness, they are at the same time in another
consciousness than that for which only pure duty, as pure duty, is in and for itself
and is sacred.1
    ¶606. Thus it is postulated that there is              another    consciousness which sanctifies
them, or which knows and wills them as duties. The first consciousness maintains
pure duty, indifferent to all         determinate content, and duty is only this indifference
towards such content. But the other consciousness contains the equally essential
relation to acting and the necessity of determinate content; since for it duties are valid
as  determinate      duties, the content as such is thereby just as essential as the form
which makes the content a duty. This consciousness is consequently a consciousness
in which the universal and the particular are simply one, and so its concept is the
same as the concept of the harmony of morality and happiness. For this opposition
likewise expresses the separation of the moral consciousness equal to itself from the
actuality which, as manifold Being, conflicts with the simple essence of duty. While,
however, the first postulate expresses only the harmony of morality and nature, as a
harmony that is in being, because in it nature is this negative of self-consciousness,
the moment of Being, now however the in-itself is essentially posited as consciousness.
For now that which is has the form of the content of duty, or is the determinacy in the
determinate duty. The in-itself is thus the unity of terms that, as simple essentialities,
are essentialities of thinking and are therefore only in a consciousness. So conscious-
ness is henceforth a master and ruler of the world, who produces the harmony of
---
                                                                                          .         

morality and happiness, and at the same time sanctifies duties as                             multiple. This
sanctification means this much, that for the consciousness of pure duty, the deter-
minate duty cannot be immediately sacred; but because a determinate duty, on
account of the actual acting, which is a determinate acting, is likewise necessary, its
necessity falls outside that consciousness into another consciousness, which is thus
the consciousness mediating the determinate duty and pure duty, and is the reason
why the determinate duty is valid as well.1
   ¶607. In the actual action, however, consciousness behaves as this Self, as a
completely singular consciousness; it is directed towards actuality as such, and has
actuality for its purpose; for it wills to achieve something. Duty in general thus falls
outside it into another essence, which is consciousness and the sacred lawgiver of
pure duty. For the consciousness that acts, just because it is acting, the other of pure
duty is immediately valid; pure duty is thus the content of another consciousness, and
is sacred for the acting consciousness only mediately, viz. in the other consciousness.1
   ¶608. Because it is in this way posited that the validity of duty, as what is sacred in
and for itself, falls outside the actual consciousness, this latter accordingly stands
altogether on one side as the           imperfect moral consciousness. Just as, in regard to its
knowledge, it knows itself then as a consciousness whose knowledge and conviction are
imperfect and contingent; similarly, in regard to its willing, it knows itself as a con-
sciousness whose purposes are affected with sensibility. On account of its unworthiness,
therefore, it cannot regard happiness as necessary, but as something contingent, and can
expect it only from grace.
   ¶609. But though its actuality is imperfect, all the same for its                          pure   will and
knowledge duty counts as the essence; in the concept, therefore, so far as the concept
is opposed to reality, or in thinking, it is perfect. But the absolute essence is just this
entity that is thought and postulated beyond actuality; the absolute essence is,
therefore, the thought in which morally imperfect knowledge and willing count as
perfect, and which thus, since it regards knowledge and willing as supremely import-
ant, also bestows happiness according to worthiness, viz. according to the                                merit
ascribed to the imperfect moral consciousness.1
   ¶610. In this, the moral world-view is completed; for in the concept of moral self-
consciousness the two aspects, pure duty and actuality, are posited in a single unity,
and consequently the one, like the other, is not posited as being in and for itself, but
as a moment, or as sublated. This becomes explicit for consciousness in the last part
of the moral world-view; that is to say, it posits pure duty in an essence other than
itself, i.e. it posits pure duty partly as something represented, partly as something that
is not what is valid in and for itself, but rather it is the non-moral that counts as
perfect. Similarly, it posits itself as a consciousness whose actuality, which falls short
of duty, is sublated and, as sublated or in the representation of the absolute essence,
no longer contradicts morality.1
   ¶611. For the moral consciousness itself, however, its moral world-view does not
have the signification that consciousness develops its own concept in it and makes
this its object; it has no consciousness of this opposition of form nor of the opposition
in content either; it does not relate and compare the sides of this opposition with one
another, but rolls onward in its development, without being the concept which holds
the moments together. For it knows the pure essence, or the object, so far as it is duty,
---
     (.)   

so far as it is an abstract object of its pure consciousness, only as a pure knowing or as
its own self. It therefore comports itself only as thinking, not as comprehending
conceptually. Consequently, the object of its                actual consciousness is not yet trans-
parent to it; it is not the absolute concept, which alone grasps otherness as such, or its
absolute contrary, as its own self. It does indeed hold its own actuality, like all
objective actuality, to be the           inessential; but its freedom is the freedom of pure
thinking, in contrast to which, therefore, nature has likewise arisen as something
that is equally free. Because both are in it in a like manner, the freedom of Being, and
the inclusion of this Being within consciousness, its object becomes as an object                           in
being, which at the same time is only in thought; in the last part of its world-view, the
content is essentially posited in such a way that its Being is only a represented Being,
and this conjunction of Being and thinking is pronounced to be what in fact it is,
representation. 1
   ¶612. When we consider the moral world-view in such a way that this objective
mode is nothing other than the very concept of moral self-consciousness, which it
makes objective to itself, then through this consciousness concerning the form of the
origin of the moral world-view, there emerges another shape of its exposition.—That
is to say, the first thing from which we set out is the actual moral self-consciousness,
or the fact that there is such a moral self-consciousness. For the concept posits it in the
determination that all actuality in general has essence for it only so far as it is in
conformity with duty, and it posits this essence as knowledge, i.e. in immediate unity
with the actual Self; hence this unity is itself actual, it is a moral, actual conscious-
ness.—Now this, as consciousness, represents its content to itself as an object, viz. as
the final purpose of the world, as harmony of morality and all actuality. But since it
represents this unity as object, and is not yet the concept which has power over the
object as such, the unity is a negative of self-consciousness for it, or it falls outside it,
as a beyond of its actuality, and yet at the same time as something that is also in being,
albeit only in thought.1
   ¶613. What is left over for this self-consciousness which, as self-consciousness,
is something other than the object, is thus the non-harmony between consciousness-
of-duty and actuality, including of course its own actuality. Accordingly, the propos-
ition now runs as follows: There is no morally perfect, actual self-consciousness;—and
since there is morality at all, only insofar as it is perfect, for duty is the                           pure
unadulterated in-itself, and morality consists only in conformity to this purity,—the
second proposition simply claims that there is no moral actuality.
   ¶614. But since, thirdly, it is one Self, it is in itself the unity of duty and actuality;
this unity therefore becomes an object for it as perfect morality,—but as a beyond of
its actuality,—yet a beyond that ought to be actual nevertheless. 1
   ¶615. In this goal of the synthetic unity of the                   first two propositions, the self-
conscious actuality as well as duty is posited only as a sublated moment; for neither
is singular, but each of the pair, whose essential determination includes being free
from the other, is thus in the unity no longer free from the other, and so each of
them is sublated, and with this, as regards content, they become object, such that
each of them passes for the other, and as regards form they become such that this
exchange between them is at the same time only represented.—Or what is actually
not moral, because it is likewise pure thinking and is elevated above its actuality, is
---
                                                                                          .      

in representation moral after all and is taken to be completely valid. In this way, the
first proposition, that there is          a moral self-consciousness, is reinstated, but bound
up with the second, that there is none, viz. that there is                   one, but only in represen-
tation; or there really is none, yet, all the same, it is allowed by another conscious-
ness to pass for one.1
.   
¶616. In the moral world-view we see, on the one hand, consciousness itself gener-
ating its object with consciousness; we see that it neither finds the object before it as
something alien, nor does the object come before it in an unconscious manner either,
but consciousness proceeds everywhere in accordance with a ground on the basis of
which it posits the objective essence; it thus knows this essence as its own self, for it
knows itself as the         active   consciousness that generates it. Consciousness seems,
therefore, to arrive here at its peace and satisfaction, for this can only be found
where it no longer needs to go beyond its object, because the object no longer goes
beyond it. On the other side, however, consciousness itself really posits the object
outside itself as a beyond of itself. But this being-in-and-for-itself is equally posited as
something that is not free from self-consciousness, but is for the sake of self-
consciousness and by means of it.1
    ¶617. The moral world-view is, therefore, in fact nothing other than the cultivation
of this fundamental contradiction in its various aspects; it is, to employ here a
Kantian expression where it is most appropriate, a whole nest of thoughtless contra-
dictions.1    The way in which consciousness proceeds in this development, is to
establish one moment and to pass immediately from it to another, sublating the
first; but now, as soon as it has set up this second moment, it also shifts it aside again,
and makes the contrary the essence instead. At the same time, it is also conscious of
its contradiction and shifting, for it passes from one moment, immediately in relation
to this very moment, over to the opposite moment; because a moment has no reality
for it, it posits that very same moment as real, or, what comes to the same thing, in
order to affirm one moment as being in itself, it affirms the opposite as the one that-
is-in-itself. In so doing it confesses that, in fact, it is in earnest with none of them.
This is what must be considered more closely in the moments of this befuddling
movement.2
    ¶618. Let us, to begin with, take for granted the presupposition that there is an
actual moral consciousness, because the presupposition is made immediately and not
in relation to something preceding, and let us turn to the harmony of morality and
nature, the     first postulate. The harmony is supposed to be in itself, not for actual
consciousness, not present; on the contrary, the present is rather only the contradic-
tion of the two. In the present, morality is assumed as on hand and actuality is so
placed that it is not in harmony with it. The actual moral consciousness, however, is
an acting consciousness; it is just in this that the actuality of its morality consists. But
in the acting itself, this position is immediately shifted; for acting is nothing other
than the actualization of the inner moral purpose, nothing other than the production
of an actuality determined by the purpose or the production of the harmony of the
moral purpose and actuality itself. At the same time, the accomplishment of the action
is for consciousness, it is the          presence    of this unity of actuality and purpose; and
---
     (.)   

because, in the accomplished action, consciousness actualizes itself as this singular
consciousness, or intuits Being-there returned into it, and because enjoyment consists
in this, there is also contained in the actuality of the moral purpose that form of
actuality which is called enjoyment and happiness.—Action, therefore, in fact imme-
diately fulfils what was proposed as not taking place, and was supposed to be only a
postulate, only a beyond. Consciousness thus proclaims through its deed that it is not
in earnest with postulating, because the sense of the action is really this, to make into
presence what was not supposed to be in presence. And since the harmony is postu-
lated for the sake of the action—that is to say, what is supposed to become                   actual
through action, must be so in itself, otherwise actuality would not be possible,—the
connection of action and postulate is so constituted that, for the sake of the action,
i.e. for the sake of the actual harmony of purpose and actuality, this harmony is posited
as not actual, as beyond.1
   ¶619. So when action takes place, the incongruity between purpose and actuality is
not taken seriously at all; action itself by contrast does seem to be taken seriously. In
fact, however, the actual action is only an action of the singular consciousness, and so
itself only something singular, and the work contingent. But the purpose of reason as
the universal, all-embracing purpose, is nothing less than the whole world; a                   final
purpose going far beyond the content of this singular action, and therefore to be placed
altogether beyond all actual acting. Because the universal best ought to be carried out,
nothing good is done. In fact, however, the nullity of actual acting, and the reality of the
whole purpose alone, which are now proposed, these, too, are in every respect again
shifted. The moral action is not something contingent and restricted, for it has as its
essence pure duty; this constitutes the sole entire purpose; and thus the action, amid all
other limitation of its content, is, as actualization of that purpose, the accomplishment
of the entire absolute purpose. Or, again, if actuality is taken as nature, which has its
own laws and stands opposed to pure duty, so that duty cannot realize its law within
nature, then, since duty as such is the essence, what we are in fact concerned with is not
the accomplishment of pure duty, which is the whole purpose; for the accomplishment
would really have as its purpose, not pure duty, but its opposite, actuality. But there is
again a shift from the position that it is not actuality with which we are concerned; for
according to the concept of moral action, pure duty is essentially an active conscious-
ness; thus there certainly ought to be action, absolute duty ought to be expressed in the
whole of nature, and the moral law to become natural law.1
   ¶620. If then we allow that this highest good is the essence, then consciousness is
not in earnest with morality at all. For in this highest good, nature does not have a law
other than that of morality. Hence moral action itself drops out, for action takes place
only under the presupposition of a negative which is to be sublated by the action. But
if nature is in conformity with the ethical law, then this law would in fact be violated
by the action, by the sublation of what is in being.—In that assumption, there is
admitted as the essential situation one in which moral action is superfluous, and does
not take place at all. The postulate of the harmony of morality and actuality,—a
harmony posited by the concept of moral action, a concept which involves bringing
the two into agreement,—is expressed from this point of view, too, as follows:
Because moral action is the absolute purpose, the absolute purpose is that moral
action should not be present at all.1
---
                                                                                         .         

    ¶621. When we put together these moments, which consciousness traversed in its
moral representation, it is clear that consciousness sublates each one again in its contrary.
Consciousness starts from the fact that, for it, morality and actuality do not harmonize,
but it is not in earnest about this, for in the action the presence of this harmony is for it.
But it is not in earnest about this acting either, since the acting is something singular; for it
has such a high purpose, the highest good. But this again is only a shifting of the Thing, for
with this all action and all morality would fall away. Or consciousness is not really in
earnest with moral action, but its heart’s desire, the absolute, is that the highest good be
accomplished, and that moral action be superfluous.1
    ¶622. From this result consciousness must proceed still further in its contradict-
ory movement, and of necessity again shift this sublation of moral action. Morality
is the in-itself; if it is to have a place, the             final purpose of the world cannot be
fulfilled, but rather the moral consciousness must be                         for itself   and    find itself
confronted by a nature opposed to it. But the moral consciousness must be perfected
within its own self. This leads to the second postulate of the harmony of itself and
the nature which is immediately in it, sensibility. Moral self-consciousness proposes
its purpose as pure, as independent of inclinations and impulses, so that the
purpose has eliminated within itself the purposes of sensibility.—But it again shifts
this proposed sublation of the sensory essence. It acts, it brings its purpose into
actuality, and the self-conscious sensibility, which is supposed to be eliminated, is
precisely this middle term between pure consciousness and actuality,—it is the
instrument of pure consciousness for its actualization, or the organ, and it is what is
called impulse, inclination. Moral self-consciousness is not, therefore, in earnest
with the sublation of inclinations and impulses, for it is just these that are the self-
actualizing self-consciousness. But they ought not to be suppressed either, but only to
be   in conformity      with reason. And they are in conformity with reason, for moral
action is nothing else but consciousness actualizing itself, thus giving itself the shape
of an impulse, i.e. it is immediately the present harmony of impulse and morality.
But impulse is not in fact merely this empty shape which could have within it a
spring other than the one it is, and be impelled by it. For sensibility is a nature
which has within itself its own laws and motivating springs; consequently, morality
cannot therefore be in earnest about being itself the mainspring impelling the
impulses, the angle of inclination for inclinations. For since these have their own
fixed determinacy and peculiar content, the consciousness to which they were to
conform would be rather in conformity with them; a conformity which moral
self-consciousness rejects. The harmony of the two is thus merely                              in itself   and
postulated.—In moral action the present                  harmony of morality and the sensibility
was proposed, but           is now     shifted; the harmony is beyond consciousness in a
nebulous remoteness where nothing can any longer be accurately distinguished or
comprehended; for our attempt just now to comprehend this unity failed.—But in
this in-itself consciousness surrenders itself altogether. This in-itself is its moral
perfection, where the struggle of morality and sensibility has ceased, and the latter is
in conformity with morality in a way that is beyond our grasp.—For that reason this
perfection is again only a shifting of the Thing, since in fact it would be rather
morality itself that was abandoned in that perfection, because it is only conscious-
ness of the absolute purpose as the              pure   purpose, and so in opposition            to all other
---
     (.)    

purposes; morality is the           activity   of this pure purpose, and also conscious of its
elevation above sensibility, of the interference of sensibility and of its opposition
and conflict with it.—Consciousness itself immediately announces that it is not in
earnest about moral perfection when it shifts it away into                      infinity, i.e. affirms that
the perfection is never complete.1
    ¶623. Thus for consciousness what really counts is only this intermediate state of
imperfection,—a state that is nevertheless at least supposed to be a                             progression
towards perfection. But it cannot even be that; for progression in morality would
really be a journey towards its disappearance. That is to say, the goal would be the
above-mentioned nothingness or sublation of morality and of consciousness itself;
but to approach ever nearer to nothingness means to diminish. Besides, progression in
general, just like diminishing, would assume quantitative differences in morality; but
there can be no question of these in it. In morality, as the consciousness for which the
ethical purpose is pure duty, there cannot be any thought at all of diversity, least of all
of the superficial diversity of quantity; there is only one virtue, only one pure duty,
only one morality.1
    ¶624. Since, then, it is not moral perfection that is taken seriously, but rather
the intermediate state, i.e. as just discussed, non-morality, we thus return, from
another side, to the content of the first postulate. That is to say, we cannot see how
happiness is to be demanded for this moral consciousness on account of its
worthiness. It is conscious of its imperfection and cannot, therefore, in fact demand
happiness as a desert, as something of which it is worthy, but it can only ask for
happiness from free grace, i.e. it can only ask for happiness as such in and for itself,
and can expect it, not on that absolute ground, but as coming to it by contingence
and wilfulness.—Here, then, non-morality declares just what it is,—that it is
concerned not about morality, but solely about happiness in and for itself without
relation to morality.1
    ¶625. By this second aspect of the moral world-view, the other affirmation of the
first aspect, in which the disharmony of morality and happiness is presupposed, is
again also sublated.—That is to say, it is a fact of experience that in this present world
what is moral often fares badly, whereas the immoral often                             flourishes. But the
intermediate state of an imperfect morality, which has emerged as what is essential,
shows manifestly that this perception, this supposed experience, is merely a shifting
of the Thing. For since morality is imperfect, i.e. morality in fact is not, what can we
make of the experience that morality fares badly?—Since, at the same time, it has
turned out that we are dealing with happiness in and for itself, it is evident that with
the judgement that immorality prospers, we were not thinking of an injustice that
occurs here. The designation of an individual as immoral falls away in itself, when
morality in general is imperfect, and has therefore only an arbitrary basis. Therefore,
the sense and content of the judgement of experience is solely this, that happiness
in and for itself should not befall some people, i.e. it is envy, which covers itself with
the cloak of morality. The reason, however, why so-called good luck should fall to the
lot of others, is good friendship, which grants and wishes them, and itself, this grace,
i.e. this lucky chance.1
    ¶626. Morality, then, in the moral consciousness is imperfect; this is what is now
proposed. But it is the essence of morality to be only the perfectly pure; imperfect
---
                                                                                          .        

morality is therefore impure, or it is immorality. Morality itself is thus in another
essence than the actual consciousness; this other essence is a holy moral lawgiver.—
The imperfect       morality in consciousness, which is the ground of this postulating,
initially   has the significance that morality, when it is posited in consciousness as
actual, stands in relation to an           other, to a Being-there, and therefore itself receives
within it otherness or difference, giving rise to a whole variety of moral commands.
The moral self-consciousness at the same time, however, holds these many duties to
be unessential; for it is concerned only with the one pure duty, and the many duties
have no truth for it insofar as they are determinate duties. They can therefore have
their truth only in an other and are made sacred, which they are not for the moral
consciousness, by a holy lawgiver.—But this itself is again only a shifting of the
Thing. For the moral self-consciousness is, to itself, the absolute, and duty is purely
and simply only what it knows as duty. But it knows as duty only pure duty; what is
not sacred for it is not sacred in itself, and what is not in itself sacred, cannot be
sanctified by the holy essence. The moral consciousness, too, is not all in earnest at
all about getting something sanctified by another consciousness than itself; for what
is sacred to it is purely and simply only what is sacred through itself and within it.—
It is, therefore, no more in earnest about the holiness of this other essence, for in
this essence something was supposed to attain to essentiality, when for the moral
consciousness, i.e. in itself, it has no essentiality.1
    ¶627. If the holy essence was postulated in order that in it duty might have its
validity, not as pure duty, but as a multiplicity of determinate duties, then this again
must be shifted, and the other essence must be holy only insofar as only pure duty has
validity in it. In fact pure duty also has validity only in another essence, not in the
moral consciousness. Although in the moral consciousness pure morality alone
seems to be valid, this moral consciousness must nevertheless be put in another
way, for it is at the same time a natural consciousness. In it, morality is affected and
conditioned by sensibility, and so is not in and for itself, but a contingency of free
will; but in it as pure will, morality is a contingency of                  knowledge; in and for itself,
therefore, morality is in another essence.1
    ¶628. This essence, then, is here the purely perfect morality, because in it morality
does not stand in relation to nature and sensibility. But the reality of pure duty is its
actualization in nature and sensibility. The moral consciousness posits its imperfec-
tion in the fact that in it morality has a positive relation to nature and sensibility,
when it counts it as an essential moment of morality that it should have simply a
negative relation to them. The pure moral essence, on the other hand, because it is
elevated above the struggle with nature and sensibility, does not stand in a negative
relation to them. Therefore, in fact, there remains for it only the positive relation to
them, i.e. precisely what just now counted as the imperfect, as the immoral. But pure
morality     completely separated from actuality, so that it was likewise without any
positive relation to it, would be an unconscious, unactual abstraction, in which the
concept of morality, which involves thinking of pure duty and a will and a doing,
would be utterly sublated. Such a purely moral essence is therefore again a shifting of
the Thing, and has to be given up.1
    ¶629. In this purely moral essence, however, the moments of the contradiction, in
which this synthetic representation                flounders about, draw near, and so do the
---
      (.)   

opposed      Also’s, which this representation, without bringing its thoughts together,
makes follow after each other, and one contrary always give way to the other, to the
point where it has to give up its moral world-view and seek refuge within itself.1
    ¶630. The moral consciousness recognizes that its morality is not perfect for the
reason that it is affected by a sensibility and nature opposed to it, which in part
tarnishes morality itself as such, and in part gives rise to a host of duties, through
which in the concrete case of actual action it gets into difficulty; for each case is the
concrescence of many moral relations, just as an object of perception in general is a
thing of many properties; and since the                   determinate      duty is a purpose, it has a
content, and its content is part of the purpose, and morality is not pure.—Morality
therefore has its       reality   in another essence. This reality, however, means nothing
other than that morality is here in and for itself,—for itself, i.e. being the morality of a
consciousness, in itself, i.e. having Being-there and actuality.—In that first imperfect
consciousness morality is not carried out; therein it is the in-itself in the sense of a
thought-thing; for it is associated with nature and sensibility, with the actuality of
Being and of consciousness that constitutes its content, and nature and sensibility are
the morally null.—In the second consciousness morality is present as                                  perfectly
accomplished        and not as an unfulfilled thought-thing. But this accomplishment
consists precisely in the fact that morality has actuality in a                     consciousness, as well
as  free actuality, Being-there in general, and is not the void but the fulfilled, the
contentful; i.e. the accomplishment of morality is posited in the fact that what has just
been determined as the morally null is present within it and in it. At one time
morality is supposed to have validity simply and solely as the unactual thought-thing
of pure abstraction, but then again equally to have no validity in this mode; its truth is
supposed to consist in its being opposed to actuality and to be entirely free and empty
of it, and then again, to consist in its being actuality.1
    ¶631. The syncretism of these contradictions, which is expounded in the moral
world-view, collapses internally, since the distinction on which it rests, the distinc-
tion between what must necessarily be thought and posited, and yet is at the same
time inessential, becomes a distinction which no longer lies even in the words. What
in the end is posited as something diverse, both as the null and also as the real, is one
and the same thing, Being-there and actuality; and what is supposed to be absolutely
only as the beyond of actual Being and consciousness, and yet equally to be only in
consciousness, and as a beyond to be the null, is pure duty and the knowledge of duty
as the essence. The consciousness which draws this distinction that is no distinction,
which declares that actuality is the null and the real at the same time,—that pure
morality is both the true essence and also devoid of essence, such a consciousness
expresses in one and the same breath the thoughts which it previously separated, and
itself proclaims that it is not in earnest about this determination and segregation of
the moments of the Self and the in-itself, but that on the contrary, what it declares as
the absolute being        outside consciousness, it really keeps enclosed within the Self of
self-consciousness, and that what it declares as what is absolutely                          thought    or the
absolute in-itself, it for that very reason takes to be something that has no truth.—It
dawns on consciousness that the segregation of these moments is a shifting, and that
it would be       hypocrisy     if it were to retain them after all. But as moral pure self-
consciousness, it        flees with abhorrence back into itself, away from this disparity
---
                                                                                          .       

between its representation and that which is its essence, away from this untruth which
declares as true what counts for it as untrue. It is pure conscience which disdains such
a moral world-representation; it is              within its own self       the simple spirit, certain of
itself, that immediately acts conscientiously without the mediation of those repre-
sentations, and in this immediacy has its truth.—But if this world of shifting is
nothing other than the development of moral self-consciousness in its moments, and
hence is its reality, then, by retreating into itself, it will not become anything else in its
essence; its retreat into itself is really only the attained consciousness that its truth is a
pretence. It would always have to pass off this pretended truth anew as its truth, for it
would have to express and present itself as an objective representation, but would
know that this is merely a shifting; it would therefore be, in fact, hypocrisy, and this
contempt for that shifting would already be the first expression of hypocrisy. 1

¶632. The antinomy of the moral world-view, that there is a moral consciousness,
and that there is none,—or that the validity of duty is a beyond of consciousness and,
conversely, takes place only within consciousness, this antinomy was condensed
in the representation in which the non-moral consciousness counts as moral, its
contingent knowing and willing are assumed to have full weight, and happiness
is granted to it as a gift of grace. Moral self-consciousness did not take this self-
contradictory representation upon itself, but transferred it to an essence other than
itself. But this transposition beyond itself of what it must think of as necessary is as
much the contradiction in form, as the other was in content. But because what
appears as contradictory, and in whose separation and subsequent resolution the
moral world-view flounders about, is in itself the same thing, viz. pure duty as pure
knowing, is nothing other than the Self of consciousness, and the Self of conscious-
ness is Being and actuality,—and similarly, because what is supposed to lie beyond
actual consciousness is nothing other than pure thinking and thus is, in fact, the Self,
because this is so, self-consciousness, for us or in itself, retreats into itself, and knows
as its own self that essence, in which what is actual is at the same time pure knowing
and pure duty. It itself is what is, in its contingency, completely valid in its own eyes,
and knows its immediate singularity as pure knowing and acting, as true actuality
and harmony.1
    ¶633. This      Self of conscience, spirit immediately certain of itself as the absolute
truth and Being, is the third Self, which has come about for us from the third world of
the spirit and must be briefly compared with the preceding Selves. The totality or
actuality that presents itself as the truth of the ethical world is the Self of the person;
its Being-there is being-recognized. Just as the person is the Self devoid of substance,
so is its Being-there abstract actuality too; the person                  counts, and does so immedi-
ately; the Self is the point immediately reposing in the element of its Being; this point
is without separation from its universality, and therefore the two are not in motion
and relation to one another: the universal is in it without differentiation, and is
neither the content of the Self, nor is the Self filled by itself.—The second Self is the
world of culture which has arrived at its truth, or the spirit of division restored to
itself,—absolute freedom. In this Self, that first immediate unity of singularity and
universality breaks apart; the universal, which equally remains a purely spiritual
---
     (.)    

essence, being-recognized or universal will and knowing, is object and content of the
Self and its universal actuality. But it does not have the form of Being-there free from
the Self; in this Self, therefore, it arrives at no filling and at no positive content, at no
world. Moral self-consciousness does indeed let its universality go free, so that it
becomes a nature of its own, and equally it holds it fast within itself as sublated. It is,
however, merely the shifting play of the alternation of these two determinations. It is
as conscience that it first has, in its self-certainty, the content for the previously empty
duty, as well as for the empty right and the empty universal will; and because this self-
certainty is equally the immediate, it has Being-there itself. 1
    ¶634. Having arrived at its truth, moral self-consciousness therefore abandons,
or rather sublates, the separation within itself which gave rise to the shifting, the
separation between the in-itself and the Self, between pure duty as pure purpose, and
actuality    as a nature and sensibility opposed to the pure purpose. It is, when thus
returned into itself, concrete moral spirit which does not, in the consciousness of pure
duty, set itself an empty standard opposed to actual consciousness; on the contrary,
pure duty, as also the nature opposed to it, are sublated moments; spirit is, in an
immediate unity, a self-actualizing moral essence, and the action is immediately a
concrete moral shape. 1
    ¶635. Suppose a given case of action; it is an objective actuality for the knowing
consciousness. This consciousness, as conscience, knows it in an immediate, con-
crete manner, and at the same time the case is only as conscience knows it. Knowing
is contingent insofar as it is something other than the object; but the spirit certain
of itself is no longer such a contingent knowing and creation of thoughts within
itself, thoughts at variance with actuality, but since the separation of the in-itself and
the Self is sublated, the case is, in the sensory certainty of knowing, immediately as
it is in itself, and it is in itself only in the way that it is in this knowing.—Action as
actualization is thereby the pure form of will; the simple conversion of an actuality,
as a case that is,      into an actuality that is done, the conversion of the bare mode of
objective knowing into the mode of knowing of actuality as a product of conscious-
ness. Just as sensory certainty is immediately taken up, or rather converted, into the
in-itself of spirit, so this conversion, too, is simple and unmediated, a transition
through the pure concept without alteration of the content, the content being
determined by the interest of the consciousness that knows it.—Further, conscience
does not split up the circumstances of the case into a variety of duties. It does not
behave as a positive universal medium, wherein the many duties would acquire, each
for itself, unshakeable substantiality, such that either no action could take place at
all, because each concrete case involves opposition in general, and, in a case of
morality, opposition of duties, and so, in the determination of action, one side, one
duty would always be violated;—or else, if action does take place, violation of one of
the conflicting duties would actually intervene. Conscience is rather the negative
One, or absolute Self, which eliminates these various moral substances; it is simple
dutiful action, which fulfils not this or that duty, but knows and does what is
concretely right. Only now, therefore, is it moral action as action at all, an action
into which the preceding deedless consciousness of morality has passed.—The
concrete shape of the deed may be analysed by the differentiating consciousness
into various properties, i.e. here, into various moral relations, and these may either
---
                                                                                         .         

each be declared to be absolutely valid (as it must be if it is supposed to be duty), or
else compared and tested. In the simple moral action of conscience, duties are
lumped together in such a way that all these single essences are immediately
demolished, and the testing and sifting of duty has no place at all in the unwavering
certainty of conscience.1
    ¶636. Just as little is there present in conscience that fluctuating uncertainty of
consciousness which now posits so-called pure morality outside itself into another,
holy essence and takes itself to be unholy, but then again posits moral purity within
itself, and the connection of the sensory with the moral in that other essence.
    ¶637. It renounces all these postures and impostures of the moral world-view,
when it renounces the consciousness that takes duty and actuality to be contradict-
ory. According to this consciousness, I act morally when I am                        conscious of accom-
plishing only pure duty and nothing else whatsoever, and this means, in fact, when
I do not     act. But when I actually act, I am conscious of an                    other, of an actuality,
which is present, and of an actuality I want to produce, I have a                               determinate
purpose and fulfil a determinate duty; and in this there is something other than the
pure duty which alone should be intended.—Conscience, on the other hand, is
consciousness concerning the fact that, when the moral consciousness declares
pure duty to be the essence of its action, this pure purpose is a shifting of the Thing;
for the Thing itself is that pure duty consists in the empty abstraction of pure
thinking, and has its reality and content only in a determinate actuality, in an
actuality which is the actuality of consciousness itself, and of consciousness not as a
thought-thing but as a singleton. Conscience has for itself its truth in the immediate
certainty of itself. This immediate concrete certainty of itself is the essence; looking
at this certainty from the point of view of the opposition of consciousness, it is
one’s own immediate            singularity    that is the content of the moral doing; and the
form of that doing is just this Self as a pure movement, viz. as the knowing or one’s
own conviction. 1
    ¶638. Looking at this more closely in its unity and in the significance of its
moments, the moral consciousness apprehended itself only as the in-itself or essence;
but as conscience it apprehends its Being-for-itself or its Self.—The contradiction of
the moral world-view resolves itself, i.e. the difference which lies at its base proves to
be no difference, and it converges on pure negativity; but this is just the Self; a simple
Self, which is a      pure   knowing, as well as knowledge of itself as                 this singular     con-
sciousness. Consequently, this Self constitutes the content of the previously empty
essence; for it is the actual Self, which no longer has the significance of being a nature
alien to the essence and independent in laws of its own. As the negative, it is the
difference of the pure essence, a content and, moreover, a content that is valid in and
for itself.1
    ¶639. Further, this Self, as pure knowing equal to itself, is the utterly universal, so
that just this knowing,         as its own     knowing, as conviction, is the            duty. Duty is no
longer the universal confronting the Self, but it is known to have no validity when
thus separated; it is now the law that is for the sake of the Self, not the Self that is for
the sake of the law. Law and duty, however, have for that reason the significance not
only of    Being-for-itself     but also of Being-in-itself; for this knowing, in virtue of its
likeness-to-itself, is precisely the in-itself. In consciousness this in-itself also separates
---
     (.)    

itself from that immediate unity with Being-for-itself; in this confrontation it is Being,
Being for another.—Duty itself, as duty forsaken by the Self, is now known to be only
a  moment; from its significance of being the                 absolute essence, it has sunk down to
Being, which is not Self, is not for itself, and is therefore                Being for another. But this
Being for another remains an essential moment just because the Self, as conscious-
ness, constitutes the opposition of Being-for-itself and Being for another, and now
duty is within itself something immediately actual, no longer merely abstract pure
consciousness.1
    ¶640. This Being for another            is, therefore, the substance that is-in-itself, distinct
from the Self. Conscience has not given up pure duty or the abstract in-itself, but duty
is the essential moment of comporting itself, as universality, towards others. Con-
science is the common element of the self-consciousnesses, and this element is the
substance in which the deed has subsistence                    and   actuality; the moment of            being-
recognized      by others. The moral self-consciousness does not have this moment of
recognition by others, of pure consciousness which is there; and consequently is not
acting, not actualizing at all. Its in-itself is for it either the abstract, unactual essence,
or Being as an actuality that is not spiritual. The actuality of conscience, however, an
actuality in being, is an actuality that is a Self, i.e. Being-there conscious of itself, the
spiritual element of being-recognized. The doing is thus only the transposition of its
singular    content into the        objective   element, in which the content is universal and
recognized, and it is just the fact that the content is recognized that makes the action
an actuality. The action is recognized and thereby actual, because the actuality that is-
there is immediately linked with the conviction or knowledge, or knowledge of its
purpose is immediately the element of Being-there, is the universal recognition. For
the   essence    of the action, duty, consists in conscience’s                  conviction     about it; this
conviction is the       in-itself  itself; it is the   in itself universal     self-consciousness, or the
being-recognized, and hence the actuality. What is done with the conviction of duty
is, therefore, immediately something that has consistency and Being-there. There
is, then, no more talk of good intentions coming to nothing, or of the good man
faring badly; on the contrary, the duty that is known to be such is fulfilled and
comes to actuality, just because conformity with duty is the universal of all self-
consciousnesses, is that which is recognized and so that which is in being. But
separated and taken on its own, without the content of the Self, this duty is                             Being
for another, the transparent, which has merely the significance of an essentiality in
general, lacking any substance.1
    ¶641. If we look back at the sphere with which spiritual reality made its entry in
general, the concept involved was that the expression of individuality is the                                in-
and-for-itself. But the shape which immediately expressed this concept was the honest
consciousness, which busied itself with the abstract Thing itself. This Thing itself was
there a predicate; but in conscience it is for the first time a subject, which has posited
all the moments of consciousness within it, and for which all these moments,
substantiality in general, external Being-there and essence of thinking, are contained
in this certainty of itself. The Thing itself has substantiality in general in the ethical
realm, external Being-there in culture, the self-knowing essentiality of thinking in
morality; and in conscience it is the subject that knows these moments within it. If the
honest consciousness always seizes only                 the empty Thing itself, conscience, on the
---
                                                                                          .         

other hand, wins the Thing in its fullness, a fullness given to it by conscience by way
of itself. Conscience is this power because it knows the moments of consciousness as
moments, and dominates them as their negative essence. 1
    ¶642. If we consider conscience in relation to the single determinations of the
opposition which appears in action,—and also its consciousness concerning the
nature of those determinations, then first of all conscience comports itself towards
the actuality of the case in which it has to act, as a knower. Insofar as the moment of
universality is in this knowing, it pertains to the knowledge of conscientious action to
embrace the actuality lying before it in an unrestricted manner, and thus to know
accurately the circumstances of the case and take them into consideration. But this
knowing, since it is aware of universality as a moment, is therefore a knowing of these
circumstances that is conscious that it does not embrace them, or that it is not
conscientious about this. The genuinely universal and pure relation of knowing
would be a relation to something not opposed, a relation to itself; but action, in virtue
of the opposition it essentially contains, is related to a negative of consciousness, to
an actuality that is in itself. In contrast to the simplicity of pure consciousness, this
actuality is the absolute other or manifoldness in itself, and is an absolute multiplicity
of circumstances which divides up and spreads out endlessly, backwards into their
conditions, sideways in their coexistence, forwards in their consequences.—The
conscientious consciousness is conscious of this nature of the Thing and of its own
relationship to it, and knows that it is not acquainted with the case in which it acts in
this required universality, and that its pretension to this conscientious assessment of
all the circumstances is vain. However, this acquaintance with, and weighing of, all
the circumstances are not altogether lacking; but only as a moment, as something that
is only for others; and its incomplete knowledge, because it is its knowledge, counts
for it as sufficient and complete knowledge. 1
    ¶643. It comports itself in a like manner with the universality of the essence, or
with the determination of the content by pure consciousness.—The conscience
proceeding to action is related to the many aspects of the case. The case splinters
asunder, and so too does the relation of pure consciousness to it, with the result that
the diversity of the case is a diversity of duties.—Conscience knows that it has to
choose between them, and to make a decision; for none of them, in its determinacy or
in its content, is absolute, but only pure duty is that. But in its reality this abstraction
has attained the significance of the self-conscious I. The spirit certain of itself rests, as
conscience, within itself, and its real universality or its duty lies in its pure conviction
of duty. This pure conviction is, as such, as empty as pure duty, pure in the sense that
nothing in it, no determinate content, is a duty. But action is called for, something
must be determined by the individual; and the spirit certain of itself, in which the in-
itself has attained the significance of the self-conscious I, knows that it has this
determination and content in the immediate certainty                         of itself. This certainty, as
determination and content, is the                 natural     consciousness, i.e. the impulses and
inclinations.—Conscience does not recognize any content as absolute for it, for it is
the absolute negativity of everything determinate. It determines from its own self; but
the sphere of the Self into which the determinacy as such falls is the so-called
sensibility; to have a content from the immediate certainty of itself, nothing is
found at hand except sensibility.—Everything that in previous shapes presented itself

as good or bad, as law and right, is something other than the immediate certainty of
itself; it is a universal which is now a Being for another; or, looked at in another way,
an object which, mediating consciousness with itself, comes between consciousness
and its own truth, and instead of being the immediacy of consciousness, it rather cuts
consciousness off from itself.—For conscience, however, certainty of itself is the pure,
immediate truth; and this truth is thus its immediate certainty of itself, represented as
content, i.e. in general the wilfulness of the singleton, and the contingency of his
unconscious natural Being.1
   ¶644. This content at the same time counts as moral essentiality or as duty. For pure
duty, as already emerged in the testing of laws, is utterly indifferent to any content and
tolerates any content. Here it has, at the same time, the essential form of Being-for-
itself, and this form of individual conviction is nothing other than consciousness of the
emptiness of pure duty and of the fact that pure duty is only a moment, that its
substantiality is a predicate which has its subject in the individual, whose wilfulness
gives it the content, can associate any content with this form and attach its conscien-
tiousness to the content.—An individual increases his property in a certain way; it is a
duty for every individual to care for the support of himself as well as his family, and no
less for the possibility of being useful to his fellow men, and of doing good to those in
need. The individual is conscious that this is a duty, for this content is immediately
contained in his certainty of himself; furthermore, he realizes that he fulfils this duty in
this case. Others, perhaps, regard this mode of certainty as humbug; they hold to other
aspects of the concrete case, but he holds firmly to this aspect, because he is conscious
of the increase of property as a pure duty.—In this way, what others call violence and
wrongdoing, fulfils the duty to maintain his independence in the face of others; what
they call cowardice, fulfils the duty of supporting his life and the possibility of being
useful to his fellow men; but what they call courage really violates both duties. But
cowardice should not be so inept as not to know that the preservation of life and the
possibility of being useful to others are duties,—so inept as not to be convinced of its
action’s conformity with duty, and not to know that conformity with duty consists in
knowing; otherwise it would commit the ineptitude of being immoral. Since morality
lies in the consciousness of having fulfilled duty, this will not be lacking to the action
when it is called cowardice any more than when it is called courage; the abstraction
called duty, as it is capable of any content, is also capable of this content,—the doer,
then, knows what he does to be a duty, and since he knows this, and the conviction of
duty is the dutiful itself, he is thus recognized by the others; the action is thereby
validated and has actual Being-there.1
   ¶645. In the face of this freedom, which inserts any content one likes, just as well as
any other, into the universal passive medium of pure duty and knowing, it is no use
to maintain that another content should be inserted; for any content, whatever it may
be, contains the blemish of determinacy from which pure knowing is free, a deter-
minacy which pure knowing can disdainfully reject, or equally can accept. Every
content, in that it is determinate, stands on a level with any other, even if it does seem
to have the precise characteristic that the particular is sublated in it. It may seem that,
since, in the actual case, duty is divided into opposition in general and thereby into
the opposition of singularity and universality, the duty whose content is the universal
itself thereby immediately contains the nature of pure duty, and form and content are
---
                                                                                          .         

thus in complete accord; so that, then, e.g. action for the universal interest is to
be preferred to action for the individual interest. However, this universal duty is in
general what is present as substance that is in and for itself, as right and law, and is
valid independently of the knowledge and conviction of the singleton, as well as of his
immediate interest; it is, therefore, precisely that against whose                       form    morality in
general is directed. But as regards its               content, that too is a        determinate       content,
insofar as the universal interest is opposed to the singular interest; consequently, its
law is a law from which conscience knows itself to be utterly free, and it assigns itself
the absolute authority to add to it and subtract from it, to neglect as well as fulfil it.—
Then, furthermore, this distinction between duty to the singular and duty to the
universal is, in accordance with the nature of opposition in general, not anything
fixed. On the contrary, what the singleton does for himself is also to the advantage of
the universal; the more he has cared for himself, the greater is not only his possibility
of his usefulness to others; but his actuality itself consists only in his being and living
in cohesion with others; his singular enjoyment essentially has the significance of
thereby surrendering what is his own to others and of helping them to obtain their
enjoyment. Therefore, in the fulfilment of duty to the singleton and so to oneself, the
duty to the universal is also fulfilled.—Any assessment and comparison of duties that
comes into play here would amount to a calculation of the advantage which the
universal derived from an action; but first, morality would thereby devolve on the
necessary     contingency      of  insight, and secondly, it is precisely the essence of con-
science to cut out this calculating and assessment, and to make its decision by itself
without any such reasons.1
    ¶646. In this way, then, conscience acts and preserves itself in the unity of Being-
in-itself and Being-for itself, in the unity of pure thinking and individuality, and is
the spirit certain of itself, which has its truth within itself, in its Self, in its
knowledge, and therein as knowledge of duty. This spirit maintains itself therein
by the very fact that what is positive in the action, the content as well as the form of
duty and the knowledge of it, belongs to the Self, to the certainty of itself; but what
seeks to    confront the Self as an          in-itself of its own      counts as something not true,
only something sublated, only a moment. Consequently, what counts is not
universal knowing in general, but conscience’s information about the circumstances.
Into duty, as the universal Being-in-itself, it inserts the content that it takes from its
natural individuality; for the content is the content present within itself; this
content becomes, in virtue of the universal medium it is in, the                            duty    that con-
science executes, and empty pure duty, just because of this, is posited as something
sublated or as a moment; this content is the sublated emptiness of pure duty, or the
filling.—But in this way conscience is free from any content whatever; it absolves
itself from any determinate duty which is supposed to have the validity of a law; in
the strength of certainty of itself it has the majesty of absolute autarky, to bind and
to loose.—This         self-determination        is therefore immediately what is purely and
simply conformable with duty; duty is the very knowing; but this simple selfhood
is the in-itself; for the in-itself is pure equality-with-itself, and this equality is in this
consciousness.1
    ¶647. This pure knowing is immediately Being for another; for, as pure equality-
with-itself, it is immediacy, or Being. But this Being is at the same time the pure
---
     (.)    

universal, the selfhood of all; or the action is recognized and therefore actual. This
Being is the element whereby conscience stands immediately in a relation of equality
with all self-consciousnesses; and the significance of this relation is not the selfless
law, but the Self of conscience.1
    ¶648. However, in that this right thing which conscience does is at the same time
a  Being for another, it seems that an inequality attaches to conscience. The duty
which it fulfils is a        determinate      content; this content is indeed the               Self  of con-
sciousness, and therein consciousness’s knowledge                     of itself, its   equality   with itself.
But once fulfilled, set in the universal medium of Being, this equality is no longer
knowledge, no longer this differentiating which just as immediately sublates its
differences; on the contrary, in Being the difference is posited as subsistent, and the
action is a determinate action, not equal with the element of the self-consciousness
of all, and so not necessarily recognized. Both sides, the acting conscience and the
universal consciousness recognizing this action as duty, are equally                           free  from the
determinacy of this doing. On account of this freedom, the relation in the common
medium of their connection is really a relationship of complete inequality; whereby
the consciousness for which the action is, finds itself in complete uncertainty about
the acting spirit certain of itself. This spirit acts, it posits a determinacy as in
being; the others hold to this             Being   as this spirit’s truth, and are therein certain
of this spirit; it has declared therein what counts for it as duty. But it is free from
any   determinate       duty whatsoever; it is beyond the point where the others opine
that it actually is; and this medium of Being itself, and duty as being in itself, count
for it only as a moment. Therefore, what it sets before them it also shifts again, or
rather has immediately shifted. For its                 actuality    is for it not this duty and this
determination it has put forward, but the duty and the determination which it has
in the absolute certainty of itself.1
    ¶649. Others, therefore, do not know whether this conscience is morally good or
whether it is evil, or rather they not only cannot know this, but they must also take it
to be evil. For, just as it is free from the determinacy of duty, and from duty as being
in itself, so likewise are they. What conscience places before them, they themselves
know how to shift; it is something expressing only the Self of another, not their own
Self: not only do they know themselves to be free from it, but they must dissolve it in
their own consciousness, reducing it to nothing by judging and explaining, in order
to preserve their own Self.
    ¶650. But the action of conscience is not only this determination of Being which
is forsaken by the pure Self. What is supposed to be valid and to be recognized as
duty, is so only through the knowledge and the conviction of it as duty, through the
knowledge of oneself in the deed. If the deed ceases to have this Self within it, it ceases
to be that which alone is its essence. Its Being-there, forsaken by this consciousness,
would be a common actuality, and the action would appear to us as a fulfilling of
one’s pleasure and desire. What is supposed to be there, is here an essentiality solely
by its being known as self-expressing individuality; and it is this being-known that is
recognized, and which, as such, ought to have Being-there. 1
    ¶651. The Self enters into Being-there, as Self; the spirit certain of itself exists as
such for others. Its          immediate      action is not what is valid and actual; what is
recognized is not the determinate, not the being-in-itself, but solely the self-knowing
---
                                                                                          .         

Self  as such. The element of subsistence is the universal self-consciousness; what
enters into this element cannot be the effect of the action: the effect does not endure
in it, and acquires no permanence; it is only self-consciousness that is recognized and
that obtains actuality.1
    ¶652. Here again, then, we see language as the Being-there of spirit. Language is
self-consciousness as being for others, self-consciousness which is immediately pre-
sent as such and, as this self-consciousness, is universal self-consciousness. Language
is the Self separating itself from itself, which as pure I=I becomes objective to itself,
which in this objectivity equally preserves itself as                  this  Self, just as it immediately
flows together with the others and is their self-consciousness; it hears itself just as it is
heard by the others, and the hearing is just Being-there that has become a Self. 1
    ¶653. The content which language has here acquired is no longer the perverted
and perverting and dismembered Self of the world of culture, but the spirit that has
reverted into itself, certain of itself, and certain in its Self of its truth or of its
recognizing, and recognized as this knowing. The language of the ethical spirit is
the law and the simple command and the complaint, which is more a tear shed over
necessity; the moral consciousness, by contrast, is still                  mute, shut up together with
itself in its interior, for in it the Self does not as yet have Being-there, but Being-there
and the Self stand as yet only in external relation to each other. Language, however,
only    emerges      as   the   middle     term     between      independent        and    recognized      self-
consciousnesses; and the Self             that is-there     is immediately universal recognition, a
recognition that is multiple, and in this multiplicity a simple recognition. The content
of the language of conscience is the Self that knows itself as essence. This alone is what
language declares, and this declaration is the true actuality of the doing and the
validity of the action. Consciousness declares its conviction; it is in this conviction
alone that the action is a duty; also it is valid as duty solely through the conviction’s
being    declared. For the universal self-consciousness is free from the                         determinate
action that      simply is; the      action    as  Being-there      counts for nothing to this self-
consciousness, what counts is the              conviction     that it is a duty, and this is actual in
language.—To actualize the action does not mean here transposing its content
from the form of purpose or of               Being-for-itself into the form of           abstract    actuality,
but transposing it from the form of immediate                        certainty    of itself, which knows
its knowledge or Being-for-itself as the essence, into the form of an assurance that
consciousness is convinced of the duty and, as conscience, knows duty from its own
self. This assurance thus assures that consciousness is convinced that its conviction is
the essence.1
    ¶654. Whether the assurance, of acting from conviction of duty, is true, whether
what is done is actually duty,—these questions or doubts have no sense in the face of
conscience.—The question whether the assurance is true would presuppose that the
inner intention is different from the alleged intention, i.e. that the willing of the
singular Self can be separated from duty, from the will of the universal and pure
consciousness; the latter would be put into words, while the former would be strictly
the true motive of the action. But it is just this distinction between the universal
consciousness and the singular Self that has sublated itself, and whose sublation is
conscience. The immediate knowing of the Self certain of itself is law and duty; its
intention, just because it is its intention, is what is right; all that is required is that it
---
      (.)   

should know this, and should state its conviction that its knowing and willing are
what is right. The declaration of this assurance in itself sublates the form of its
particularity; it recognizes therein the necessary universality of the Self; in calling itself
conscience, it calls itself pure self-knowing and pure abstract willing, i.e. it calls itself a
universal knowing and willing that recognizes the others, is like them, for they are
just this pure self-knowing and willing,—and which for that reason is also recognized
by them. In the willing of the Self that is certain of itself, in this knowledge that the
Self is essence, lies the essence of what is right.—Therefore, whoever says he acts thus
from conscience, speaks truly, for his conscience is the Self that knows and wills. But
it is essential that he should           say   this, for this Self must be at the same time the
universal Self. It is not universal in the content of the act, for the content, owing to its
determinacy, is in itself indifferent; it is in the form of the act that the universality lies;
it is this form which is to be posited as actual; the form is the Self, which as such is
actual in language, declares itself to be the true, and just in so doing recognizes all
Selves and is recognized by them.1
    ¶655. Conscience, then, in the majesty of its elevation above determinate law
and every content of duty, puts whatever content it pleases into its knowing and
willing; it is the moral genius which knows the inner voice of its immediate know-
ledge to be a divine voice, and since in this knowledge genius just as immediately
knows Being-there, it is the divine creative force which has vitality in its concept.
Equally, it is divine service within itself, for its action is the intuiting of this divinity
of its own.1
    ¶656. This solitary divine service is at the same time essentially the divine service
of a   community, and the pure inner                knowing     and perceiving of itself advances to
become a moment of consciousness. The intuition of itself is its objective Being-there,
and this objective element is the declaration of its knowing and willing as a universal.
Through this declaration the Self acquires validity and the act becomes an accom-
plishing deed. The actuality and the subsistence of its doing is the universal self-
consciousness; but the declaration of conscience posits the certainty of itself as a pure
Self, and thereby as a universal Self; on account of this talk, in which the Self is
expressed and recognized as essence, the others allow the act to be valid. The spirit
and the substance of their union is thus the mutual assurance of their conscien-
tiousness, of good intentions, the rejoicing over this reciprocal purity, and their
basking in the splendour of knowing and declaring, of the care they lavish on such
excellence.—Insofar as this conscience still distinguishes its abstract consciousness
from its      self-consciousness, it has only           hidden     its life in God; God is certainly
immediately       present to its mind and heart, to its Self; but what is manifest, its
actual consciousness and the mediating movement of that consciousness, is for it
something other than that hidden interior and the immediacy of the present
essence. However, in the perfection of conscience the difference between its abstract
consciousness and its self-consciousness is sublated. Conscience knows that the
abstract    consciousness is just this Self, this Being-for-itself that is certain of itself,
knows that the diversity is sublated precisely in the immediacy of the relation of the
Self to the in-itself, an in-itself which when posited outside the Self is the abstract
essence and what is hidden from it. For that relation is a                         mediating      relation, in
which the related terms are not one and the same, but each is an                                other   for the
---
                                                                                          .         

other, and only in a third term are they one; but the immediate relation means in
fact nothing other than unity. Consciousness, elevated above the thoughtlessness of
still regarding these differences, which are none, as differences, knows the imme-
diacy of the presence within it of the essence as the unity of the essence and its Self,
it thus knows itself as the living in-itself, and knows this knowledge as religion,
which, as knowledge intuited or being-there, is the speech of the community about
its own spirit.1
   ¶657. Here, then, we see self-consciousness withdrawn into the depths of its
interior, for which all externality as such vanishes,—withdrawn into the intuition
of the I=I, in which this I is the whole of essentiality and Being-there. It plunges
into this concept of itself, for it is driven to the edge of its extremes, and in such a
way, moreover, that the different moments, whereby it is real or is still conscious-
ness, are not these pure extremes only for us, but on the contrary what it is for
itself, and what is for it in itself and what is for it Being-there, have evaporated into
abstractions which no longer have any stability, any substance, for this conscious-
ness itself; and everything that hitherto was essence for consciousness has reverted
into these abstractions.—Refined into this purity, consciousness is its poorest
shape, and the poverty which constitutes its unique possession is itself a vanishing;
this absolute     certainty    into which substance has dissolved is the absolute                     untruth
which collapses internally; it is the absolute self-consciousness in which conscious-
ness is submerged1.
   ¶658. Looking at this submergence of consciousness in its interior, the substance
that is-in-itself is, for consciousness, knowledge as its knowledge. As consciousness, it
is separated into the opposition of itself and the object which is, for it, the essence; but
it is just this object that is perfectly transparent, is its own Self, and its consciousness is
only the knowledge of itself. All life and all spiritual essentiality have withdrawn into
this Self and have lost diversity from the I itself. The moments of consciousness are,
therefore, these extreme abstractions, none of which remains standing but loses itself
in the other and engenders it. It is the exchange of the unhappy consciousness with
itself, but here this exchange proceeds for consciousness itself in its interior, and is
conscious of being the concept of reason, whereas the unhappy consciousness is that
concept only in itself. The absolute certainty of itself thus finds itself, as conscious-
ness, changed immediately into a sound dying away, into objectivity of its Being-for-
itself; but this world created is its talk, which it has just as immediately heard and
only the echo of which returns to it. This return, therefore, does not have the
significance that the Self is         in   and   for itself  in it; for the essence is for it not in-
itself, but only itself; just as little has consciousness                Being-there, for the objective
element does not get as far as being a negative of the actual Self, any more than this
Self attains to actuality. It lacks the force of estrangement, the force to make itself into
a thing, and to endure Being. It lives in dread of besmirching the splendour of its
interior by action and Being-there; and, in order to preserve the purity of its heart, it
shuns contact with actuality, and persists in its obstinate impotence, impotence to
renounce its Self, whittled down to ultimate abstraction, and to give itself substan-
tiality, or to transform its thinking into Being and put its trust in the absolute
difference. The hollow object which it creates for itself now                      fills it, therefore, with
the consciousness of emptiness; its doing is a yearning which merely loses itself in its
---
     (.)   

becoming an object devoid of essence, and, falling back into itself beyond this loss,
only   finds itself as lost;—in this transparent purity of its moments, it becomes an
unhappy, so-called beautiful soul, its light fades away within it, and it vanishes like
a shapeless vapour that dissolves into thin air.1
   ¶659. This silent confluence of the pithless essentialities of the evaporated life has,
however, still to be taken in the other significance of the actuality of conscience and
in the appearance of its movement, and conscience has to be considered as acting.—
The objective moment in this consciousness has determined itself above as universal
consciousness; the knowledge that knows itself is, as                     this  Self, distinct from other
Selves; the language in which all reciprocally recognize each other as acting con-
scientiously, this universal likeness, falls apart into the unlikeness of singular Being-
for-itself, each consciousness is just as much simply reflected out of its universality
into itself; thereby the opposition of singularity to the other singletons, and to the
universal, necessarily comes on the scene, and we have to consider this relationship
and its movement.—Or this universality and duty have the very opposite signifi-
cance, that of the determinate              singularity    exempting itself from the universal, a
singularity for which pure duty is only universality that has come to the                              surface
and is turned outwards; duty lies only in words and is valid as a Being for another.
Conscience, which is initially directed only                  negatively     against duty as this         given
determinate duty, knows itself free from it; but when it fills up the empty duty with
a determinate content from itself, it has the positive consciousness of the fact that it,
as this Self, makes its own content; its pure Self, as empty knowing, is something
devoid of content and determination; the content which it gives to that knowing is
drawn from its own Self, as this determinate Self, from itself as natural individuality,
and, in speaking of the conscientiousness of its action, it may well be conscious of its
pure Self, but in the purpose of its acting, a purpose as actual content, it is conscious
of itself as this particular singleton, and conscious of the opposition between what it
is for itself and what it is for others, the opposition of universality or duty and its
being-reflected out of universality.1
   ¶660. If in this way the opposition, into which conscience enters when it acts,
expresses itself in its interior, the opposition is at the same time an unlikeness
outwardly in the element of Being-there, the unlikeness of its particular singularity
to another singleton.—Its particularity consists in the fact that the two moments
constituting its consciousness, the Self and the in-itself, are unequal in value within it,
and more precisely with the determination that the certainty of itself is the essence, in
contrast to the in-itself or the universal, which counts only as a moment. This internal
determination is thus confronted by the element of Being-there or by the universal
consciousness, for which the essence is rather universality, duty, whereas singularity,
on the other hand, which in contrast to the universal is for itself, counts only as a
sublated moment. For this tenacious adherence to duty, the                             first consciousness
counts as evil, because it is the unlikeness of its Being-within-itself with the universal,
and since, at the same time, this first consciousness declares its doing as likeness with
itself, as duty and conscientiousness, it counts as hypocrisy.1
   ¶661. The      movement       of this opposition is initially the formal establishment of
likeness between what evil is within itself and what it declares; it must come to light
that it is evil, and that its Being-there is thereby equal to its essence, the hypocrisy
---
                                                                                          .        

must be unmasked.—This return of the unlikeness present in hypocrisy into like-
ness has not already come about in the fact that hypocrisy, as is commonly said,
demonstrates its respect for duty and virtue just by adopting the semblance of them
and using it as a mask for its own consciousness, no less than for the consciousness of
others; a recognition in itself of the opposite in which likeness and agreement would
be contained.—Only, hypocrisy is at the same time just as much reflected out of this
verbal recognition and into itself; and the fact that it uses what is-in-itself only as a
Being for another         involves rather its own contempt for it, and the exposure to
everyone of its lack of essence. For what lets itself be used as an external instrument
shows itself to be a thing, which has within it no weight of its own.1
    ¶662. Also, this likeness is not brought about either by the evil consciousness’s
sticking one-sidedly to its guns, or by the judgement of the universal.—If the evil
consciousness disavows itself in face of the consciousness of duty, and asserts that
what this declares to be wickedness, to be absolute unlikeness with the universal, is an
action in accordance with inner law and conscience, then in this one-sided assurance
of likeness its unlikeness with the other remains, since in fact this other does not
believe the assurance or recognize it.—Or since the one-sided persistence in one
extreme cancels itself out, evil would indeed thereby confess to being evil, but in so
doing it would       immediately sublate itself and no longer be hypocrisy, nor would it
unmask itself as such. It admits, in fact, to being evil by asserting that it acts, in
opposition to the recognized universal, according to its inner law and conscience. For
if this law and conscience were not the law of its singularity and wilfuless, it would not
be something inner, something of its own, but what is universally recognized.
Therefore, when anyone says that he acts towards others according to his                              law and
conscience, he is saying, in fact, that he mistreats them. But actual conscience is not
this persistence in the knowledge and will that opposes the universal, but on the
contrary, the universal is the element of its Being-there, and its language declares its
doing as recognized duty. 1
    ¶663. Just as little is the persistence of the universal consciousness in its judgement
an unmasking and dissolution of hypocrisy.—In denouncing hypocrisy as bad, base,
and so on, it appeals in such judgement to                    its law, just as the      evil  consciousness
appeals to     its  law. For the former comes forward in opposition to the latter and
thereby as a particular law. It has, therefore, no advantage over the other law, rather it
legitimizes it; and this zeal does the very contrary of what it opines that it does—that
is, it shows that what it calls true duty and what ought to be universally recognized, is
something unrecognized, and it thereby concedes to the other an equal right of Being-
for-itself.1
    ¶664. This judgement has, however, at the same time another side from which it
becomes the introduction to a resolution of the opposition present.—The conscious-
ness of the universal does not conduct itself as actual and                      acting   towards the first
consciousness,—for the latter is rather the actual consciousness,—but in its oppos-
ition to it it behaves as a consciousness that is not entangled in the opposition of
singularity and universality, an opposition that comes into play in action. It remains
in the universality of        thought, behaves as a consciousness that                apprehends, and its
first action is only judgement.—Now, through this judgement, it places itself, as we
have just remarked,          alongside    the   first consciousness, and the latter,            through this
---
     (.)   

likeness, arrives at an intuition of itself in this other consciousness. For the con-
sciousness of duty maintains an attitude of apprehension, passivity; but it is thereby in
contradiction with itself as the absolute will of duty, with itself as a consciousness
whose determining comes simply from itself. It has no difficulty in preserving its
purity, for it does not act; it is the hypocrisy which wants to see its judging taken for
an actual deed, and instead of proving its rectitude by action, it does so by uttering
fine sentiments. It is constituted, then, in entirely the same way as the consciousness
which is reproached with making duty a mere matter of talk. In both of them the side
of actuality is equally distinct from the talk, in one of them, through the self-serving
purpose of the action, in the other, through the failure to act at all, when the necessity
of action is involved in the very fact of speaking of duty, for duty without deeds is
utterly meaningless.1
   ¶665. Judging, however, is also to be considered as a positive act of thought and
has a positive content; through this aspect, the contradiction present in the appre-
hending consciousness, and its likeness with the                     first consciousness, become still
more complete.—The consciousness that acts declares its determinate doing to be
duty, and the consciousness that judges cannot gainsay this; for duty itself is the form
which lacks all content but is capable of any,—or the concrete action, in all its many-
sidedness and intrinsic diversity, has in it the universal aspect, the aspect that is taken
as duty, just as much as the particular aspect which constitutes the share and the
interest of the individual. Now, the judging consciousness does not stop short at
the former aspect of duty and at the agent’s knowledge of the fact that this is his
duty, the situation and the status of his actuality. On the contrary, it holds to the
other aspect, pursues the action into the interior, and explains it by its intention at
variance with the action itself, and by selfish motives. Just as every action is capable
of being considered in its conformity to duty, so too can it be considered in this
other way, in its      particularity; for, as action, it is the actuality of the individual.—
This judging of the action thus takes it out of its Being-there and reflects it into the
interior, or into the form of its own particularity.—If the act is attended by glory,
then the judging knows this interior as thirst for glory;—if it is altogether in keeping
with the station of the individual, without going beyond this station, and so
constituted that the individuality does not have its station attached to it as an
external determination, but through its own efforts gives filling to this universality,
thereby showing itself capable of something higher, then judging knows the interior
of the act as ambition, and so on. When, in the action in general, the agent attains to
an intuition of itself in objectivity, or to self-feeling, a feeling of itself in its Being-
there, and thus to enjoyment; then judgement knows the interior as an urge towards
one’s own happiness, even if this were to consist merely in an inner moral vanity, in
the enjoyment of the consciousness of one’s own excellence and in the foretaste of
the hope of a future happiness.—No action can escape such judgement, for duty for
duty’s sake, this pure purpose, is nothing actual; it has its actuality in the doing of
the individuality, and the action thereby has in it the aspect of particularity.—No
man is a hero to his valet; not, however, because the man is not a hero, but because
the valet—is a valet, whose dealings are with the man, not as a hero, but as one who
eats, drinks, and wears clothes, in general in the singularity of needs and of represen-
tation. Thus, for judging, there is no action in which it could not oppose the aspect
---
                                                                                          .       

of the individuality’s singularity to the universal aspect of the action and, with regard
to the agent, play the part of the valet of morality.1
   ¶666. This judging consciousness is thus itself                    base, because it divides up the
action, and produces and sticks              firmly to the unlikeness of the action with itself.
It is, moreover, hypocrisy, because it passes off such judging, not as another manner
of being evil, but as the          just consciousness        of the action and, in this unactuality
and vanity of knowing well and better, sets itself up above the deeds it runs down,
and wants to have its deedless talk taken for a superior actuality.—By putting itself,
then, on an equal footing with the agent, on which it passes judgement, it is
recognized by the agent as the same as himself. The agent does not merely                                 find
himself apprehended by the other as something alien and unlike it, but rather finds
the other, in its own constitution, like himself. Intuiting this likeness and expressing
it, he confesses to the other, and equally expects that the other, as he has in fact put
himself on a par with it, will also respond in                    words    expressing its      likeness  with
himself, and expects that the Being-there of recognition will now come into play.
His confession is not an abasement, a humiliation, a degradation relatively to the
other; for this utterance is not a one-sided affair, in which he posits his unlikeness
with the other; on the contrary, he expresses himself solely on account of his
intuition of the other’s likeness with him; he, on his side, gives expression to their
likeness   in his confession, and he expresses it for the reason that language is the
Being-there of spirit as immediate Self; he therefore expects that the other will make
his contribution to this Being-there.1
   ¶667. But the admission of the one who is evil,                     It’s me, is not followed by the
response of a like admission. This is not what the judging consciousness meant; quite
the contrary! It repulses this community away from itself, and is the hard heart that is
for itself and rejects continuity with the other.—As a result, the scene is reversed. The
one who made the confession sees himself repulsed, and sees the other in the wrong
when it refuses to let its interior come forth into the Being-there of speech, when the
other opposes to evil the beauty of its own soul, opposes to the confession the stiff
neck of the character that remains like itself and the silence in which it keeps to itself
and refuses to humble itself before anyone else. Here there is posited the supreme
rebellion of the spirit certain of itself; for it intuits itself, as this simple knowledge of
the Self, in the other, and that too, in such a way that even the outer shape of this
other is not, as in the case of wealth, what is lacking in essence, is not a thing, but it is
rather the thought, the knowledge itself, that is pitted against it, it is this absolutely
fluid continuity of pure knowing which refuses to enter into communication with the
other,—with the other who, in its confession, already renounced isolated Being-for-
itself, and posited itself as sublated particularity and thereby as continuity with the
other, as a universal. But the other, within itself, keeps to itself its uncommunicative
Being-for-itself; within the confessant, it nevertheless retains the very same thing that
the penitent has already discarded. The judging consciousness thereby reveals itself
as the spirit-forsaken and spirit-denying consciousness; for it does not recognize that
spirit, in the absolute certainty of itself, is master over every deed and actuality, and
can reject them and make them as if they had never happened. At the same time, it
does not recognize the contradiction it falls into in not letting the rejection which has
happened in words, count as a true rejection, while it itself has the certainty of its
---
     (.)   

spirit, not in an actual action, but in its interior, and has its Being-there in the words
of its judgement. It is thus itself which hinders the other’s return from the deed into
the spiritual Being-there of speech and into the likeness of spirit, and by this
harshness produces the unlikeness which is still present.1
   ¶668. Now, insofar as the spirit certain of itself, as a beautiful soul, does not possess
the force to estrange the knowledge of itself remaining in itself, it cannot attain to
likeness with the repulsed consciousness, nor therefore to an intuited unity of itself in
the other, cannot attain to Being-there; consequently, the likeness comes about only
negatively, as a spiritless Being. The beautiful soul, devoid of actuality, in the
contradiction between its pure Self and the necessity of that Self to estrange
itself into Being and to change into actuality, in the immediacy                        of this entrenched
opposition—an immediacy which alone is the middle term and reconciliation of the
opposition, intensified to its pure abstraction, and is pure Being or empty nothing—
this beautiful soul, then, as consciousness of this contradiction in its unreconciled
immediacy, is disordered to the point of derangement, and wastes away in nostalgic
consumption. Thereby it in fact abandons the tenacious grip on
and produces only the spiritless unity of Being.1                                        its Being-for-itself,
   ¶669. The true equalization, viz. the equalization that is self-conscious and is-there,
is already contained in the foregoing in accordance with its necessity. The breaking of
the hard heart, and its elevation to universality, is the same movement which was
expressed in the consciousness that made confession of itself. The wounds of the
spirit heal, and leave no scars behind; the deed is not the imperishable, but is taken
back by spirit into itself, and the aspect of singularity that is present in it, whether as
intention or as negativity that-is-there and limitation of this negativity, is what
immediately vanishes. The actualizing Self, the form of its action, is only a moment
of the whole, and so likewise is the knowledge, that determines by judgement and
establishes the distinction between the singular and universal aspects of the action.
This evil posits this estrangement of itself or posits itself as a moment, being enticed
into the Being-there of confession by the intuition of itself in the other. But just as the
former had to have its one-sided, unrecognized Being-there of particular Being-for-
itself broken, so too must this other have its one-sided, unrecognized judgement
broken; and just as the former exhibits the power of spirit over its actuality, so does
this other exhibit the power of spirit over its determinate concept.1
   ¶670. The latter, however, renounces the dividing thought, and the hardness of the
Being-for-itself which clings to it, because it in fact intuits itself in the first. This first
consciousness, which discards its actuality and makes itself into a sublated This, in
fact presents itself thereby as a universal; it returns from its external actuality back
into itself as essence; the universal consciousness thus recognizes itself in it.—The
forgiveness which it extends to the first consciousness is the renunciation of itself, of
its unactual      essence, the essence with which it equates that other consciousness
which was actual action, and it recognizes as good that which, from the determin-
ation that the action received in thought, was called evil, or rather it abandons this
distinction of the determinate thought as well as its determining judgement that is-
for-itself, just as the other abandons its determining of the action, a determining that
is-for-itself too.—The word of reconciliation is the spirit that is-there, the spirit that
intuits the pure knowledge of itself as universal essence in its contrary, in the pure
---
                                                                                           .         

knowledge of itself as the           singularity that is absolutely within itself,—a reciprocal
recognition which is the absolute spirit. 1
   ¶671. Absolute spirit enters into Being-there only at the highest point, where its
pure knowledge about itself is the opposition and exchange with itself. Knowing that
its pure knowledge is the abstract essence, absolute spirit is this duty that knows, in
absolute opposition to the knowledge that knows itself, as absolute singularity of the
Self, to be the essence. The former knowledge is the pure continuity of the universal,
which knows as a nullity in itself, as evil, the singularity that knows itself as essence.
The latter knowledge, however, is the absolute discretion which knows itself abso-
lutely in its pure oneness, and knows that universal as what is unactual, which is only
for others. Both sides are refined to the purity in which there is no longer in them any
selfless Being-there, any negative of consciousness, but where the duty is the charac-
ter, remaining equal to itself, of its knowing itself, and the evil equally has its purpose
in its Being-within-itself, and its actuality in its talk; the content of this talk is the
substance of its subsistence; it is the assurance of the certainty of spirit within itself.—
Each of these two self-certain spirits has no other purpose than its pure Self, and no
other reality and Being-there than just this pure Self. But they are still diverse; and
the diversity is absolute diversity because it is posited in this element of the pure
concept. It is absolute, too, not only for us, but for the concepts themselves which
stand in this opposition. For these concepts are certainly determinate with regard to
one another, but are at the same time in themselves universal, so that they fill out the
whole range of the Self, and this Self has no other content than this its determinacy,
which neither goes beyond it nor is more restricted than it; because one of them, the
absolute universal, is just as much the pure knowing-of-itself as the other, the
absolute discretion of singularity, and both are only this pure self-knowing. Both
determinacies are thus the knowing pure concepts, whose determinacy is itself
immediately a knowing, or whose relationship and opposition is the I. Consequently,
they are these sheer opposites            for one another; it is that which is perfectly interior
which thus confronts itself and has entered into Being-there; they constitute                               pure
knowledge which, through this opposition, is posited as consciousness. But it is still
not yet self-consciousness. It has this actualization in the movement of this oppos-
ition. For this opposition is rather itself the indiscrete continuity and equality of the
I=I; and each for itself, just through the contradiction of its pure universality, which at
the same time still resists its equality with the other and cuts itself off from it, sublates
itself within itself. Through this estrangement, this knowledge, divided in its Being-
there, returns into the unity of the Self; it is the actual I, the universal knowing of itself
in its absolute contrary, in the knowledge that is-within-itself, and which, on account
of the purity of its isolated Being-within-self, is itself the perfectly universal. The
reconciling     Yes, in which the two I’s desist from their opposed                      Being-there, is the
Being-there of the I expanded into duality, an I which therein remains equal to itself
and, in its complete estrangement and contrary, has the certainty of itself;—it is God
appearing in the midst of those who know themselves as pure knowledge.1

        VII. Religion
¶672. In the configurations so far, which are distinguished broadly as consciousness,
self-consciousness,      reason, and      spirit,  religion   too as consciousness of the             absolute
essence    in general, has indeed occurred,—but only from the standpoint of the con-
sciousness that is conscious of the absolute essence; but the absolute essence in and for
itself, the self-consciousness of spirit, has not appeared in those forms. 1
    ¶673. Even consciousness, insofar as it is understanding, becomes consciousness of
the supersensible or the interior           of objective Being-there. But the supersensible, the
eternal, or whatever else we may call it, is                  self-less; to begin with it is only the
universal, which is still far from being the spirit that knows itself as spirit.—And
then    self-consciousness, which reaches its completion in the shape of                             unhappy
consciousness, was only the pain               of the spirit    fighting its way towards objectivity
again, but failing to reach it. The unity of the                  singular   self-consciousness and its
changeless      essence, a unity towards which self-consciousness proceeds, therefore
remains a      Beyond for it. The immediate Being-there of                  reason, which emerged for
us from that pain, and its peculiar shapes, involve no religion, because their self-
consciousness knows or seeks itself in the immediate present. 1
    ¶674. On the other hand, in the ethical world we did see a religion, namely, the
religion of the underworld; it is the belief in the terrible, unknown night of fate and in
the Eumenides of the           departed spirit: the former is pure negativity in the form of
universality, the latter the same negativity in the form of singularity. So in the latter
form the absolute essence is in fact the Self, and present, since the Self cannot be other
than present; but the singular            Self is  this singular shade which has separated from
itself the universality which is fate. It is indeed a shade, a sublated This, and thus a
universal Self; but its negative meaning has not yet turned into this positive meaning,
and therefore the sublated Self still immediately signifies this particular and essence-
less entity as well. But fate without the Self remains the unconscious night which does
not attain to differentiation within itself, nor to the clarity of self-knowledge.1
    ¶675. This belief in the nothing of necessity and in the underworld becomes belief in
heaven, because the departed Self must unite with its universality, display what it
contains within this universality, and so become clear to itself. But we saw this realm
of faith unfold its content only in the element of thinking without the concept, and
consequently perish in its fate, namely, in the religion of enlightenment. In this religion,
the supersensible beyond of the understanding is restored, but in such a way that self-
consciousness remains satisfied in this world and knows the supersensible beyond—the
empty, impenetrable and innocuous beyond—neither as Self nor as power.1
---
                                                                                     .            

   ¶676. In the religion of morality, the absolute essence finally has a positive content
restored to it; but this content is combined with the negativity of the enlightenment.
It is a Being that is at the same time taken back into the Self and remains enclosed in
it, and a differentiated content whose parts are immediately negated as soon as they
are put in place. But the fate that engulfs this contradictory movement is the Self,
conscious of itself as the fate of essentiality and actuality. 1
   ¶677. In religion the spirit that knows itself is immediately its own pure                                self-
consciousness. The shapes of spirit that we have considered—the true spirit, the
self-alienated spirit, and the spirit certain of itself—together constitute spirit in its
consciousness, which, confronting its               world, does not recognize itself in it. But in
conscience it subjugates to itself its objective world in general as well as its represen-
tation and its determinate concepts, and is now self-consciousness that is at one with
itself. In this self-consciousness, spirit has for itself, represented as object, the signifi-
cance of being the universal spirit that contains within itself all essence and all
actuality; but it is not in the form of free actuality or of nature appearing as
independent. It does have shape or the form of Being, in that it is                         object of its own
consciousness; but because in religion consciousness is posited in the essential
determination of being self-consciousness, the shape is perfectly transparent to itself;
and the actuality that spirit contains is enclosed within it and sublated within it, in
just the same way as when we speak of                      all actuality; this is universal actuality,
actuality in thought.1
   ¶678. Since, then, in religion the determination of spirit’s consciousness proper
does not have the form of free otherness, the Being-there of spirit is distinct from its
self-consciousness, and its actuality proper falls outside religion; there is indeed one
spirit of both, but its consciousness does not embrace both together, and religion
appears as a part of Being-there, of doing and dealing, whose other part is life in its
actual world. As we now know that spirit in its world and spirit conscious of itself as
spirit, or spirit in religion, are the same, the completion of religion consists in the two
becoming equal to each other: it requires not only that spirit’s actuality be embraced
by religion, but, conversely, that spirit, as spirit conscious of itself, become actual to
itself and object of its own consciousness.—Insofar as spirit in religion represents itself
to itself, it is indeed consciousness, and the actuality enclosed within religion is the
shape and the clothing of its representation. But, in this representation, actuality does
not receive its full entitlement, its right to be not merely clothing but independent
free Being-there; and, conversely, because actuality lacks completion within itself, it is
a determinate shape which does not attain what it is supposed to display, viz. spirit
conscious of itself. For its shape to express spirit itself, the shape would have to be
nothing other than spirit, and spirit would have to appear to itself, or actually be, as it
is in its essence. Only in this way could something else be achieved as well, something
that may seem to be the requirement of the contrary, viz. that the                                object   of its
consciousness has at the same time the form of free actuality; but only the spirit
that is object to itself as absolute spirit is aware of itself as free actuality while also
remaining conscious of itself therein.1
   ¶679. Since self-consciousness and consciousness proper, religion and spirit in its
world, or the       Being-there      of spirit, are initially distinct, the Being-there of spirit
consists in the whole of spirit insofar as its moments present themselves separately,
---
     (.) 

each for itself. But the moments are                consciousness,      self-consciousness,      reason, and
spirit,—spirit, that is, as immediate spirit, which is not yet consciousness of spirit.
Their totality, taken together, constitutes spirit in its worldly Being-there in general;
spirit as such contains the foregoing configurations in universal determinations, in
the moments just mentioned. Religion presupposes the whole sequence of these
moments and is their           simple    totality or absolute Self.—Incidentally, the course of
these moments, in their relationship to religion, is not to be represented in time. Only
the whole spirit is in time, and the shapes, which are shapes of the whole spirit                             as
such, present themselves in a succession; for only the whole has proper actuality and
therefore the form of pure freedom in face of another thing, a form that expresses
itself as time. But the          moments      of this whole, consciousness, self-consciousness,
reason, and spirit, just because they are moments, have no Being-there different
from one another.—Just as spirit was distinguished from its moments, so again, in
the third place, the singularized determination of these moments must be distin-
guished from the moments themselves. That is, we saw each of those moments
differentiate itself again internally in a course of its own, and assume diverse shapes:
as, e.g., in consciousness, sensory certainty and perception were distinct. These latter
aspects separate from each other in time and belong to a particular whole.—For spirit
descends from its universality through determination to                      singularity. The determin-
ation, or middle term, is consciousness, self-consciousness, and so on. But singularity is
constituted by the shapes of these moments. These shapes therefore present spirit in
its singularity or actuality, and are distinguished from one another in time, though in
such a way that the succeeding shape retains its predecessors in it.1
    ¶680. If, therefore, religion is the completion of spirit into which the singular
moments of spirit—consciousness, self-consciousness, reason, and spirit—return and
have returned as into their ground, together they constitute the actuality that is-there
of the whole spirit, which only               is as the movement of these aspects of itself¸ a
movement that distinguishes them and returns into itself. The becoming of religion
in general is contained in the movement of the universal moments. But since each of
these attributes was presented, not only as it determines itself in general, but as it is in
and for itself, i.e. as it runs its course within itself as a whole, what has arisen as a
result is not only the becoming of religion in general, but those complete courses of
the singular aspects also contain the determinacies of religion itself. The whole spirit,
the spirit of religion, is again the movement by which it ascends from its immediacy
to the knowledge of what it is in itself or immediately, and eventually ensures that the
shape in which it appears for its consciousness is perfectly equal to its essence, and
that it intuits itself as it is.—So in this becoming, spirit itself is in determinate shapes
which constitute the differences of this movement; at the same time, the determinate
religion thereby has a         determinate actual spirit as well. Thus if consciousness, self-
consciousness, reason, and spirit belong to self-knowing spirit in general, then to the
determinate shapes of self-knowing spirit there belong the determinate forms which
developed within consciousness, self-consciousness, reason, and spirit, developed in
each in its own particular way. From the shapes of each one of spirit’s moments, the
determinate shape of religion picks out for its actual spirit the one that corresponds to
it. The one determinacy of the religion penetrates every aspect of its actual Being-
there and impresses on them this common stamp.1

                                                                                     .         

   ¶681. In this way, the shapes that have arisen so far arrange themselves differently
from the order in which they appeared in their sequence, and on this point we should
briefly note in advance what is needed.—In the series we considered, each moment,
delving into its own depths, cultivated itself into a whole within its own peculiar
principle; and cognition was the depth, or the spirit, in which the moments, which for
themselves have no subsistence, had their substance. But this substance has now
come to light; it is the depth of spirit certain of itself, a depth that does not allow the
singular principle to isolate itself and to make itself a whole within itself, but
gathering and holding together all these moments within itself, it advances within
this entire wealth of its actual spirit, and all the particular moments of this spirit take
into themselves and receive in common the same determinacy of the whole.—This
spirit certain of itself and the movement of this spirit is their genuine actuality and
the Being-in-and-for-itself which pertains to each singular moment.—Thus while the
previous single series in its advance marked the reversions in it by nodes, but
continued on again from them in one direction, from now on it is, as it were, broken
at these nodes, the universal moments, and split up into many lines which, gathered
together into a single bundle, at the same time combine symmetrically, so that the
similar differences, into which each particular line shaped itself inside itself, con-
verge.—Incidentally, it is self-evident from the whole presentation how this co-
ordination of the universal directions here represented is to be understood; so that
it is superfluous to remark that these differences are to be conceived essentially only
as moments of the becoming, not as parts; in the actual spirit, they are attributes of its
substance, but in religion they are only predicates of the subject.—Similarly,                               in
themselves     or  for us all forms in general are contained in spirit and in each spirit,
but as regards spirit’s actuality in general, all that matters is which determinacy is for
it in its consciousness, in which determinacy it knows its Self expressed or in which
shape it knows its essence.1
   ¶682. The distinction which was drawn between actual spirit and spirit that knows
itself as spirit, or between itself as consciousness and self-consciousness, is sublated in
the spirit that knows itself according to its truth; its consciousness and its self-
consciousness are equalized. But as religion here is at first immediate, this distinction
has not yet returned into spirit. It is only the concept of religion that is posited; in this
concept the essence is self-consciousness, which is to itself all truth and in this truth
contains all actuality. This self-consciousness has, as consciousness, itself as object;
spirit, which at      first knows itself immediately, is thus to itself spirit in the                form    of
immediacy, and the determinacy of the shape in which it appears to itself is that of
Being. Certainly, this Being is filled neither with sensation or manifold material, nor
with other one-sided moments, purposes, and determinations: it is filled with spirit
and is known by itself as all truth and actuality. In this way this filling is not equal to
its shape, spirit as essence is not equal to its consciousness. Spirit is actual only as
absolute spirit, when it is also for itself in its truth as it is in the certainty of itself, or
when the extremes into which it divides itself as consciousness are for each other in
spirit’s-shape. The configuration which spirit assumes as object of its consciousness
remains filled by the certainty of spirit as by the substance; through this content, the
degeneration of the object to pure objectivity, to the form of negativity of self-
consciousness, is averted. The immediate unity of spirit with itself is the foundation,
---

or pure consciousness, within which consciousness splits asunder. Enclosed in this
way in its pure self-consciousness, spirit does not exist in religion as the creator of a
nature in general; what it produces in this movement are its shapes as spirits, which
together constitute the entirety of its appearance; and this movement itself is the
becoming of its complete actuality through the singular aspects of this actuality, or
through the incomplete actualities of spirit.1
   ¶683. The      first  actuality of spirit is the concept of religion itself, or religion as
immediate and thus natural religion. In this religion, spirit knows itself as its object
in a natural or immediate shape. The second actuality, however, is necessarily that in
which spirit knows itself in the shape of                 sublated naturalness         or of the    Self. This,
then, is the religion of art; for the shape raises itself to the form of the Self through
the   productivity     of consciousness whereby consciousness intuits in its object its
doing or the Self. Finally, the third            actuality sublates the one-sidedness of the first
two; the Self is just as much an immediate Self, as the immediacy is Self. If in the first
actuality spirit in general is in the form of consciousness, and in the second, in the
form of self-consciousness, then in the third it is in the form of the unity of both; it
has the shape of Being-in-and-for-itself; and since it is thus represented as it is in and
for itself, this is the revealed religion. But although in this religion spirit attains its
true shape, yet the very shape itself and the representation are still the unsurmounted
aspect from which spirit must pass over into the concept, in order wholly to dissolve
the form of objectivity in it, in the concept which equally includes this contrary of
itself. Then spirit has grasped the concept of itself, just as we have grasped it for the
first time; and its shape or the element of its Being-there, since it is the concept, is
spirit itself.1
A. Natural religion
¶684. The spirit that knows spirit is consciousness of itself and is present to itself in
the form of the objective; it is; and is at the same time Being-for-itself. It is for itself, it
is the aspect of       self-consciousness, and that too in contrast to the aspect of its
consciousness, or of its relating to itself as                 object. In its consciousness there is
opposition, and therefore the determinacy of the shape in which it appears to itself
and knows itself. It is only this determinacy that concerns us in this treatment of
religion; for the unshaped essence of spirit, or its pure concept, has already emerged.
But at the same time the difference of consciousness and self-consciousness falls
within the latter; the shape of religion does not contain the Being-there of spirit, as it
is nature free of thought, nor as it is thought, free of Being-there; but the shape is
Being-there maintained in thinking, as well as something thought that is there for it.
One religion distinguishes itself from another by the                     determinacy       of this shape in
which spirit knows itself; but we should also note that the presentation of this
knowledge of itself in accordance with this                  singular determinacy          does not in fact
exhaust the whole of an actual religion. The series of diverse religions that will
emerge, just as much presents again only the diverse aspects of a single religion,
and indeed of every singular religion, and the representations that seem to distinguish
one actual religion from another occur in every religion. At the same time, however,
the diversity must also be viewed as a diversity of religion. For since spirit is situated
in the difference between its consciousness and its self-consciousness, the aim of the
---
                                                                                     .           

movement is to sublate this cardinal distinction and to give the form of self-
consciousness to the shape that is object of consciousness. But this difference is not
sublated simply by the fact that the shapes that consciousness contains have in them
also the moment of the Self, and that God is represented                       as self-consciousness. The
represented      Self is not the        actual   Self; if the Self, like any other more specific
determination of the shape, is to belong to this shape in truth, it must,                              first, be
posited in the shape by the doing of self-consciousness and, secondly, the lower
determination must show itself to be sublated and comprehended by the higher. For
what is represented ceases to be something represented and alien to its knowledge,
only because the Self has produced it and therefore intuits the determination of the
object as its own, and so intuits itself in the object.—Through this activity, the lower
determination has at the same time disappeared; for the doing is the negative that is
realized at the expense of something else; insofar as the lower determination still
occurs as well, it has withdrawn into inessentiality; just as, by contrast, where the
lower determination is still dominant but the higher also occurs, the one determin-
ation resides selflessly alongside the other. Accordingly, if the various representations
within a singular religion do indeed present the entire movement of the forms of the
religion, then the character of each religion is determined by the particular unity of
consciousness and self-consciousness, i.e. by the fact that self-consciousness has
taken into itself the determination of the object of consciousness, has completely
appropriated it by its doing, and knows it as the essential determination in contrast to
the others.—The truth of the belief in a determination of the religious spirit is shown
in the fact that the actual spirit is constituted like the shape in which the spirit intuits
itself in the religion,—as, e.g., the incarnation of God which occurs in oriental
religion has no truth, because the actual spirit of that religion is without this
reconciliation.—This is not the place to return from the totality of determinations
to the singular determination, and to show in which shape within this determination
and its particular religion the others are contained in their entirety. The higher form
downgraded beneath a lower has lost its meaning for the self-conscious spirit,
belongs to it only superficially and belongs to its representation. The higher form is
to be considered in its peculiar meaning and where it is the principle of this particular
religion and is authenticated by its actual spirit.1

¶685. Spirit as the        essence    that is   self-consciousness—or the self-conscious essence
that is all truth and knows all actuality as its own self,—is at first only its own concept
in contrast to the reality which it gives itself in the movement of its consciousness;
and this concept is, in contrast to the day of this unfolding, the night of its essence; in
contrast to the Being-there of its moments as independent shapes, it is the creative
secret of its birth. This secret has its revelation within itself; for the Being-there has its
necessity in this concept, because this concept is the spirit that knows itself and so it
has in its essence the moment of being consciousness and of representing itself
objectively.—It is the pure I, which in its estrangement has within itself as universal
object the certainty of its own self, or this object is for the I the penetration of all
thinking and all actuality.1

    ¶686. In the immediate            first bifurcation of the self-knowing absolute spirit its
shape has the determination appropriate to                   immediate consciousness or to             sensory
certainty. Spirit intuits itself in the form of Being, though not the spiritless Being filled
with the contingent determinations of sensation, the Being that pertains to sense-
certainty, but it is the Being filled with spirit. This Being also includes within itself the
form which occurred in immediate self-consciousness, the form of the master con-
fronting the self-consciousness of spirit that retreats from its object.—This                             Being
replete with the concept of spirit is thus the shape of the simple relation of spirit to
itself, or the shape of shapelessness. In virtue of this determination, this shape is the
pure, all-embracing and all-fulfilling             light-essence of sunrise, which preserves itself
in its formless substantiality. Its otherness is the equally simple negative, darkness;
the movements of its own estrangement, its creations in the unresisting element of
its otherness, are light-showers; in their simplicity, they are at the same time its
becoming-for-itself and return from its Being-there,                       fire-streams consuming the
configuration. The difference which this essence acquires proliferates exuberantly
in the substance of Being-there and shapes itself into the forms of nature; yet the
essential simplicity of its thinking roams about in them without stability and under-
standing, extends its limits beyond measure, and dissolves its beauty, heightened to
splendour, in its sublimity.1
    ¶687. The content that this pure Being develops, or its perceiving, is therefore an
essenceless sideshow in this substance, which only ascends, without descending into
itself, without becoming a subject and consolidating its differences by means of the
Self. The determinations of this substance are only attributes which do not advance to
independence, but remain merely names of the many-named One. This One is
clothed with the manifold forces of Being-there and with the shapes of actuality as
with a selfless adornment; they are merely messengers, with no will of their own,
messengers of its power, visions of its glory, voices in its praise.1
    ¶688. However, this reeling life must determine itself to                    Being-for-itself and give
subsistence to its vanishing shapes. The                  immediate Being          in which it confronts
its consciousness is itself the          negative    power which dissolves its distinctions. It is
thus in truth the        Self; and spirit therefore passes on to know itself in the form of
Self. Pure light disperses its simplicity as an infinity of forms, and offers itself as a
sacrifice to Being-for-itself, so that in its substance the singular entity takes subsist-
ence for itself.1
.       
¶689. The self-conscious spirit, having withdrawn into itself from the shapeless
essence or elevated its immediacy to the Self in general, determines its simplicity as
a diversity of Being-for-itself, and is the religion of spiritual perception, in which spirit
splinters into an innumerable multiplicity of weaker and stronger, richer and poorer
spirits. This pantheism, initially the             peaceful    subsistence of these spiritual atoms,
becomes a hostile movement within itself. The innocence of the religion of flowers,
which is merely selfless representation of the Self, passes into the earnestness of the
life of conflict, into the guilt of the religion of animals; the tranquillity and impotence
of contemplative individuality passes into destructive Being-for-itself.—It is of no
use to have taken from the things of perception the death of abstraction and to have
---
                                                                                    .           

elevated them to essences of spiritual perception; the ensouling of this realm of spirits
has this death in it owing to the determinacy and the negativity which encroach on its
innocent indifference. Through determinacy and negativity, the dispersion into the
multiplicity of peaceful shapes of plants becomes a hostile movement in which the
hatred of their Being-for-self consumes them.—The actual self-consciousness of this
dispersed spirit is a host of singularized, unsociable national spirits which in their
hatred fight each other to the death and become conscious of determinate shapes of
animals as their essence; for they are nothing other than animal-spirits, animal-lives
separating from one another, and conscious of themselves without universality.1
    ¶690. In this hatred, however, the determinacy of purely negative Being-for-self
consumes itself, and through this movement of the concept spirit enters into another
shape. Sublated Being-for-itself is the form of the object, a form which is produced by
the Self, or rather which is the Self produced, the self-consuming Self, i.e. the Self
becoming a thing. The worker therefore retains the upper hand over these merely
rending animal spirits, and his doing is not only negative, but pacified and positive.
So from now on the consciousness of spirit is the movement which is beyond
immediate       Being-in-itself    and beyond abstract Being-for-itself. Since the in-itself is
reduced, through opposition, to a determinacy, it is no longer the proper form of
absolute spirit, but an actuality which its consciousness                       finds confronting it as
common Being-there, and which it sublates; likewise, this consciousness is not just
this sublating Being-for-self, but it also produces its representation, Being-for-self set
forth in the form of an object. This production, however, is not perfect production,
but a conditioned activity and the forming of something at hand.1
.    
¶691. So spirit here appears as the               artisan, and his doing, whereby he produces
himself as object but without having yet grasped the thought of himself, is an
instinctive labour, like that of bees building their cells.1
    ¶692. The first form, since it is the immediate form, is the abstract form of the
understanding, and the work is not yet within itself filled by spirit. The crystals of
pyramids and obelisks, simple combinations of straight lines with plane surfaces and
equal proportions of parts, in which the incommensurability of the curve is elimin-
ated, these are the labours of this artisan of the austere form. Owing to the mere
intelligibility of the form, this form is not its significance within itself, not the
spiritual Self. Thus the works either receive spirit into themselves only as an alien,
departed spirit that has abandoned its living saturation with actuality and, itself dead,
takes up its abode in this lifeless crystal;—or they have an external relation to spirit, as
to a spirit that is itself there externally and not as spirit—as to the dawning light,
which casts its meaning on them.1
    ¶693. The working spirit sets out from the separation between                             Being-in-itself
which becomes the material it works on,—and Being-for-itself, which is the side                              of
the self-consciousness at work. This separation has become objective to it in its
artefact. Its further effort must aim at sublating this separation of soul and body: to
clothe and give shape to the soul in its own self, and to ensoul the body. When the
two sides are brought closer to each other, they still retain, with respect to each other,
the determinacy of represented spirit and of its surrounding envelope; spirit’s union
---
     (.) 

with itself contains this opposition of singularity and universality. While the artefact
comes closer to itself in its two sides, something else happens at the same time as a
result of this: the artefact comes closer to the working self-consciousness, and this
self-consciousness, in the artefact, attains to knowledge of itself as it is in and for
itself. But in this way, the artefact at            first constitutes only the abstract side of the
activity of spirit, an activity which does not yet know its content within itself, but in
its artefact, which is a thing. The artisan himself, the spirit in its entirety, has not yet
appeared, but is the still inner, hidden essence which, as a whole, is present only
divided into active self-consciousness and the object it has produced.1
   ¶694. So the surrounding abode, the outer actuality which is elevated at first only
to the abstract form of understanding, is worked up by the artisan into a more
animated form. For this purpose he employs plant-life, which is no longer sacred as it
was to the earlier, impotent pantheism, but is taken by the artisan, who conceives
himself as the essence that is for itself, as useful material and is reduced to an outer
aspect and an ornament. But it is not used unaltered; for the worker of the self-
conscious form at the same time obliterates the transience inherent in the immediate
existence of this life and brings its organic forms closer to the more rigorous and
more universal forms of thought. The organic form, when left to itself, proliferates
wildly in particularity, but when it is on its side subjugated by the form of thought,
then on the other side it elevates these rectilinear and plane shapes to a more
animated curvature—a mixture that becomes the root of free architecture. 1
   ¶695. This dwelling, the side of the universal element or of the inorganic nature of
spirit, now also encloses a shape of singularity which brings nearer to actuality the
spirit that was previously cut off from Being-there, internal or external to it, and
thereby makes the artefact more like the active self-consciousness. The worker at first
resorts to the form of Being-for-itself            in general, to the animal shape. That he is no
longer conscious of himself immediately in animal life, he proves by constituting
himself in face of it as the force producing it, and by knowing himself in this life as in
his artefact; whereby the animal shape at the same time becomes a sublated shape and
the hieroglyph of another meaning, of a thought. Hence too, the shape is no longer
used alone and entirely by the worker, but blended with the shape of thought, with
the human shape. But the artefact still lacks the shape and Being-there in which the
Self exists as Self;—it still fails to proclaim within its own self that it contains within it
an inner meaning, it lacks the language, the element, in which the fulfilling sense is
itself present. Therefore even when the artefact is wholly purified of animality and
wears only the shape of self-consciousness, it is the still soundless shape which needs
the ray of the rising sun in order to have sound which, engendered by light, is even
then only noise and not language, showing only an outer Self, not the inner Self.1
   ¶696. In contrast to this outer Self of the shape stands the other shape which
indicates that it has in it an interior. Nature, withdrawing into its essence, reduces its
living diversity, singularizing itself and entangling itself in its movement, to an
inessential shell, which is the          covering of the interior; and this interior is initially
still simple darkness, the motionless, the black, formless stone.1
   ¶697. Both presentations contain inwardness and Being-there,—the two moments
of spirit; and both presentations contain the two moments at once in a relationship of
opposition, the Self as inner and the Self as outer. The two have to be united.—The
---
                                                                                    .    

soul of the statue in human form does not yet come from the interior, is not yet
language, the Being-there that is internal within its own self,—and the interior of
multiform Being-there is still the soundless, does not differentiate itself within
itself, and is still separated from its exterior, to which all differences belong.—The
artisan therefore unites the two in blending the natural shape and the self-
conscious shape, and these ambiguous essences, enigmatic to themselves, the
conscious struggling with the unconscious, the simple inner struggling with the
variously shaped outer, the darkness of the thought pairing with the clarity of
expression, these break out into the language of a profound wisdom hard to
understand.1
    ¶698. In this work the instinctive labour that produced the unconscious work
confronting self-consciousness, comes to end; for in this artefact, the activity of
the artisan, which constitutes the self-consciousness, encounters an equally self-
conscious, self-expressive interior. In it he has worked his way up to the division of
his consciousness, where spirit meets spirit. In this unity of self-conscious spirit with
itself, insofar as it is the shape and the object of its own consciousness, its mixtures
with the unconscious mode purify themselves of the immediate natural shape. These
monstrosities in shape, word, and deed dissolve into spiritual configuration,—into an
exterior that has retreated into itself, into an interior that expresses itself out of itself
and in its own self; they dissolve into a thought, which is a Being-there engendering
itself and preserving its shape in conformity with thought and is a lucid reality. Spirit
is artist.1
B. Religion of art
¶699. Spirit has raised the shape in which it is for its own consciousness into the form
of consciousness itself and it produces such a form before itself. The artisan has given
up   synthetic    working, the        mixing    of the alien forms of thought and of nature;
now that the shape has gained the form of self-conscious activity, he has become a
spiritual worker.1
    ¶700. If we ask, what is the actual spirit which has the consciousness of its absolute
essence in the religion of art, then the answer is that it is the ethical or the true spirit.
This spirit is not only the universal substance of all singletons; since this substance
has for actual consciousness the shape of consciousness, this means, in addition, that
this substance, which has individualization, is known by the singletons as their own
essence and product. So for them it is not the light-essence in whose unity the Being-
for-self of self-consciousness is contained only negatively, only in a transitory way,
and beholds the master of its actuality,—nor is it the consuming and relentless hatred
of hostile peoples,—nor their subjugation to castes which together constitute the
semblance of organization of a completed whole, but a whole that lacks the universal
freedom of the individuals. No, this spirit is the free people in which custom
constitutes the substance of all, whose actuality and Being-there each and everyone
knows as their own will and deed.1
    ¶701. The religion of the ethical spirit is, however, the elevation of this spirit above
its actuality, the withdrawal from its truth into the pure knowledge of itself. Since the
ethical people lives in immediate unity with its substance and does not have in it the
principle of the pure singularity of self-consciousness, its religion emerges in its
---
     (.) 

perfection only in its detachment from its subsistence. For the actuality of the ethical
substance depends partly on its tranquil                 immutability       in contrast to the absolute
movement of self-consciousness, and consequently on the fact that this self-
consciousness has not yet withdrawn into itself from its tranquil custom and from
its firm trust;—partly, it depends on the organization of self-consciousness into a
multiplicity of rights and duties, as well as into the distribution into the masses of the
estates and their particular doings which work together to form the whole; and hence
it depends on the fact that the singleton is contented with the limitation of his Being-
there and has not yet grasped the boundless thought of his free Self. But that tranquil
immediate trust in the substance turns back into trust in oneself and into the certainty
of oneself, and the multiplicity of rights and duties, like the restricted doing, is the
same dialectical movement of the ethical sphere as the multiplicity of things and their
determinations—a movement which finds its rest and stability only in the simplicity
of the spirit certain of itself.—The completion of the ethical sphere to free self-
consciousness, and the fate of the ethical world, are therefore the individuality that
has withdrawn into itself, the absolute levity of the ethical spirit which has dissolved
within itself all     firm distinctions of its subsistence and the masses of its organic
articulation and, entirely sure of itself, has attained to boundless jubilation and the
freest enjoyment of itself. This simple certainty of spirit within itself has a twofold
significance: it is tranquil subsistence and settled truth, as well as absolute unrest and
the expiry of the ethical order. But it changes round into the latter; for the truth of the
ethical spirit is at first still only this substantial essence and trust, in which the Self
does not know itself as free singularity, and which therefore goes to ruin in this
inwardness or in the liberation of the Self. So when the trust is broken, when the
substance of the people is crushed within itself, then spirit, which was the mean
between the unstable extremes, has now come forth into an extreme, that of self-
consciousness conceiving itself as essence. This is spirit certain within itself, which
mourns the loss of its world and now produces its essence from the purity of the Self,
an essence raised above actuality.1
   ¶702. In such an epoch absolute art arises; before this, art is an instinctive type of
labour, which, submerged in Being-there, works its way out of Being-there and
into Being-there; it does not have its substance in the free ethical order and therefore
does not have free spiritual activity for the Self at work either. Later on, spirit goes
beyond art in order to gain its higher presentation;—in order to be, that is, not only
the substance born of the Self, but to be, in its presentation as object, this Self, not only
to give birth to itself from its concept, but to have its very concept for its shape, so
that the concept and the work of art produced know each other mutually as one
and the same.1
   ¶703. Since the ethical substance has withdrawn from its Being-there back into its
pure self-consciousness, this is the side of the concept or of the activity with which
spirit produces itself as object. This activity is pure form, because the singleton, in
ethical obedience and service, has worked off all unconscious Being-there and rigid
determination, just as that substance itself has become this fluid essence. This form is
the night in which substance was betrayed and made itself into subject; it is out of this
night of pure certainty of itself that the ethical spirit is resurrected as the shape freed
from nature and its own immediate Being-there.1

    ¶704. The existence of the pure concept into which spirit has fled from its body is
an individual which spirit chooses as the vessel of its grief. In this individual, spirit
is as his universal and as his power from which he suffers violence,—as his pathos, by
his surrender to which his self-consciousness loses its freedom. But this positive
power of universality is subdued by the pure Self of the individual, the negative
power. This pure activity, conscious of its inalienable force, struggles with the
shapeless essence; becoming its master, it has made the pathos into its own material
and given itself its content, and this unity emerges as a work, as universal spirit
individualized and represented.1

¶705. The first work of art, as the immediate work of art, is the abstract and singular
work. For its part, it has to move away from this immediate and objective mode
towards self-consciousness, while on the other hand self-consciousness for itself
aims, in the cult, at sublating the differentiation it at first adopts towards its spirit,
and in this way at producing a work of art that is intrinsically animate.1
    ¶706. The      first way in which the artistic spirit keeps its shape and its active
consciousness as far apart as possible is the immediate way: the shape                            is there   as
thing    in general.—The shape divides within itself into the distinction between
singularity, which has in it the shape of the Self,—and universality, which presents
the inorganic essence in relation to the shape, as its environment and habitation. By
the elevation of the whole into the pure concept, this shape acquires its pure form,
appropriate to the spirit. It is neither the understanding-derived crystal, which
houses what is dead or is illumined by the external soul,—nor the mixture, proceed-
ing first from the plant, of the forms of nature and of thought, a thought whose
activity here is still an        imitation. No, the concept strips off the traces of root,
branches, and leaves still adhering to the forms and purifies these forms into
structures in which the straight line and plane surface of the crystal are elevated
into incommensurable relationships, so that the ensouling of the organic is taken up
into the abstract form of the understanding and at the same time the essence of this
ensouling, incommensurability, is preserved for the understanding.1
    ¶707. But the indwelling god is the black stone removed from its animal covering
and now pervaded with the light of consciousness. The human shape strips off the
animal shape with which it was mixed; the animal is for the god only a contingent
disguise; it steps alongside its true shape and no longer has any worth for itself, but is
reduced to the meaning of something other than itself, to a mere sign. For this very
reason, the shape of the god within its own self strips off also the poverty of the
natural conditions of animal Being-there, and hints at the internal dispositions of
organic life fused into its surface and belonging only to this surface.—But the essence
of the god is the unity of the universal Being-there of nature and the self-conscious
spirit that in its actuality appears in opposition to nature. At the same time, being
initially a singular shape, its Being-there is one of the elements of nature, just as its
self-conscious actuality is a singular national spirit. But this Being-there is, in this
unity, the element reflected into spirit, nature transfigured by thought, nature united
with self-conscious life. The shape of the gods therefore has its nature-element within
it as a sublated element, as a dim recollection. The chaotic essence and confused
---
     (.) 

struggle of the free Being-there of the elements, the unethical realm of the Titans, is
conquered and banished to the border of an actuality that has become clear to
itself, to the bleak boundaries of a world that                 finds itself in spirit and is there at
peace. These ancient gods, into which the light-essence, procreating with darkness,
initially particularizes itself, the heaven, the earth, the ocean, the sun, the earth’s blind
typhonic fire, and so on, are replaced by shapes that now have in them only a dimly
reminiscent suggestion of those Titans, and which are no longer essences of nature,
but lucid, ethical spirits of self-conscious peoples.1
   ¶708. This simple shape has thus obliterated in itself the unrest of endless
singularization—the singularization of the nature-element, which acts necessarily
only as universal essence, but in its Being-there and movement acts contingently, as
well as the singularization of the people which, dispersed into the particular masses of
activity and into individual points of self-consciousness, has a Being-there of mani-
fold sense and activity—and condensed it into tranquil individuality. This individu-
ality is therefore confronted by the moment of unrest, it—the essence—is confronted
by  self-consciousness, for which, as the birthplace of that individuality, has nothing
left for itself except to be pure activity. What belongs to the substance, the artist
imparted entirely to his product, but to himself as a determinate individuality he
gave no actuality in his product; he could confer perfection on his product only by
discarding his particularity, by disembodying himself and ascending to the
abstraction of pure activity.—In this first immediate production, the separation
of the work from his self-conscious activity has not yet given way to their
reunification; therefore the artefact is not for itself the actually ensouled artefact,
it is a whole only together with its becoming. The common factor in the work of art,
viz. that it is engendered in consciousness and made by human hands, is the
moment of the concept existing as concept, which stands in contrast to the work.
And if this concept, as artist or as spectator, is disinterested enough to declare the
work of art as in its own self absolutely ensouled, and to forget himself, the agent
or viewer, then we must offset this by insisting on the concept of spirit which
cannot dispense with the moment of being conscious of itself. But this moment
stands in opposition to the artefact because in this initial division of itself the
concept gives the two sides their abstract, contrasting determinations of doing and
of being-a-thing, and their return into the unity from which they set out has not
yet come about.1
   ¶709. The artist, then, learns from experience of his work that he did not produce
an essence equal to himself. From it, no doubt, there comes back to him a conscious-
ness, in that an admiring crowd reveres it as the spirit which is their own essence. But
since this ensouling returns his self-consciousness to him only as admiration, it is
rather a confession that this ensouling makes to the artist that it is not his equal. Since
his product comes back to him as joyfulness in general, he does not find in it the pain
of its fashioning and generation, nor the effort of his labour. They may well judge the
work or bring it offerings, repose their consciousness in it, in any way whatsoever,—if
they in their acquaintance with it set themselves above it, he knows how much more
his deed is worth than their talk and understanding; if they place themselves below it
and recognize in it the essence that dominates them, he knows himself as the master
of this essence.1

   ¶710. The work of art therefore requires another element of its Being-there, the
god requires another mode of emergence than this, in which, out of the depths of his
creative night, he descends into the contrary, into externality, into the determination
of the unselfconscious thing. This higher element is language,—a Being-there that is
immediately self-conscious existence. Just as the singular self-consciousness is there
in language, so it is also immediately present as a universal contagion; the complete
particularization of Being-for-itself is at the same time the fluidity and the universally
communicated unity of the many Selves; language is the soul existing as soul. So the
god, who has language as the element of his shape, is the intrinsically ensouled work
of art which has immediately in its Being-there the pure activity that stood in contrast
to the god, when he existed as a thing. Or self-consciousness, in the objectification of
its essence, remains immediately together with itself. Being thus together with itself
in its essence, it is      pure thinking, or the devotion whose                 inwardness       at the same
time has Being-there in the hymn. The hymn retains within itself the singularity of
self-consciousness, and, when heard, this singularity is at the same time there as
universal; devotion, kindled in everyone, is the spiritual stream which, in the multi-
plicity of self-consciousness, is conscious of itself as a uniform doing of all, and as
simple Being; spirit, as this universal self-consciousness of all, has in a single unity its
pure inwardness, as well as Being for others and the Being-for-self of the singletons.1
   ¶711. This language is distinct from another language of the god which is not the
language of universal self-consciousness. The oracle, both of the god of the religions
of art and of preceding religions, is his necessary first language; for it is implied in the
concept of the god that he is the essence both of nature and of spirit, and therefore has
not only natural but spiritual Being-there as well. Insofar as this moment is at first
implied in his concept and not yet realized in religion, the language is, for the religious
self-consciousness, language of an              alien  self-consciousness. The self-consciousness
that is still alien to its community is not yet there in the way its concept requires. The
Self is simple Being-for-itself and thereby a purely universal Being-for-itself; but the
Self that is separated from the self-consciousness of the community is at first only a
singular self-consciousness.—The content of this singular language of its own stems
from the universal determinacy in which the absolute spirit in general is posited in its
religion.—Thus the universal spirit of the sunrise, which has not yet particularized its
Being-there, utters equally simple and universal statements about the essence; their
substantial content is sublime in its simple truth, but because of this universality at
the same time appears trivial to self-consciousness as it becomes more cultivated.1
   ¶712. The more cultivated Self which rises to                       Being-for-itself     is master over
the pure pathos of substance, over the objectivity of the dawning light-essence,
and knows this simplicity of truth as the being-in-itself that does not have the form
of contingent Being-there through an alien tongue, but knows it                            as the sure and
unwritten law of the gods, a law that lives eternally and of which no one knows when
it appeared.—The universal truth that was revealed by the light-essence has here
withdrawn into the interior or into the depths, and is thus released from the form
of contingent appearance, but, on the other hand, in the religion of art, since
the shape of the god has taken on consciousness and hence singularity in general,
the god’s own language—the god who is the spirit of the ethical people—is the oracle,
which knows the particular affairs of the people and discloses what is useful in this
---

regard. The universal truths, however, because they are known as what-is-in-itself, are
claimed by thinking in its knowledge, and the language of these truths is no longer a
language alien to thinking but a language of its own. That wise man of antiquity
searched in his own thinking for what is good and                       fine, whereas he left it to the
daemon to know the petty contingent content of knowledge—whether it was good
for him to associate with this or that person, or good for an acquaintance to go on a
journey, and suchlike insignificant things; in the same way the universal conscious-
ness derives knowledge of the contingent from birds or trees or the fermenting earth,
whose vapour robs self-consciousness of its wits; for the contingent is the witless
and alien, and therefore the ethical consciousness lets itself be determined in such
matters too, as by a throw of dice, in a witless and alien manner. When the singleton
determines himself by his understanding and chooses with deliberation what is useful
for him, this self-determination is based on the determinacy of the particular
character; this determinacy is itself the contingent, and therefore this knowledge
supplied by the understanding as to what is useful for the singleton is knowledge of
the same sort as knowledge derived from those oracles or from the lot; except that
someone who consults the oracle or lot thereby expresses the ethical sentiment of
indifference to contingency, whereas the knowledge of the understanding, by contrast,
treats what is in itself contingent as an essential interest of its thinking and knowing.
But there is something higher than both, and this is to make deliberation the oracle for
contingent activity, but to know that this deliberated action is itself something
contingent owing to its relation, on one side, to its utility and to the particular.1
    ¶713. The true self-conscious Being-there that spirit acquires in speech, which is
not the speech of an alien, and therefore contingent, non-universal self-consciousness,
is the work of art we met with before. It stands in contrast to the thingly artwork of
the statue. While the statue is a Being-there in repose, that of speech is a vanishing
Being-there; while in the statue’s Being-there the objectivity set free lacks an imme-
diate Self of its own, in speech, by contrast, objectivity remains too much enclosed in
the Self, falls too far short of a shaping and is, like time, no longer immediately there
when it is there.1
    ¶714. In the movement of the two sides, the divine shape in motion in the pure
sensitive element of self-consciousness, and the divine shape at rest in the element of
thinghood, mutually surrender their diverse determinations, and the unity which is
the concept of their essence comes to Being-there. This movement is constituted by
the cult. In the cult the Self assumes the consciousness of the descent of the divine
essence from its other-worldliness to itself, and this divine essence, which before that
is an essence lacking actuality and only objective, thereby acquires the genuine
actuality of self-consciousness.1
    ¶715. This concept of the cult is already implicitly contained and present in the
stream of the hymnal song. This devotion is the immediate, pure satisfaction of
the Self by and within itself. The Self is the purified soul which, in this purity, is
immediately only essence and is one with the essence. Because it is abstract, the soul
is not the consciousness that distinguishes its object from itself; it is thus only the
night of its Being-there and the site prepared for its shape. The abstract cult therefore
elevates the Self to being this pure                divine element. The soul accomplishes this
purification with consciousness; yet it is still not the Self that has descended into its
---
                                                                                     .         

depths and knows itself as evil; it is something that just is, a soul that purifies its
exterior by washing, clads it in white garments, and its interior passes along the
represented path of labours, punishments, and rewards, the path of cultivation in
general, the cultivation that sheds particularity; by this path it reaches the dwellings
and the community of bliss.1
   ¶716. This cult is, at first, only a secret accomplishment, i.e. an accomplishment
that is only represented, not actual; it must be an actual action, for an action that is
not actual contradicts itself. Consciousness proper                  thereby raises itself into its pure
self-consciousness. The essence has in it the significance of a free object; through the
actual cult this object returns into the Self—and insofar as the object has, in pure
consciousness, the significance of the pure essence dwelling beyond actuality, this
essence descends from its universality, through this mediation, to singularity, and
thus joins together with actuality.1
   ¶717. The entry of the two sides into the action determines itself in such a way that
for the self-conscious side, insofar as it is actual consciousness, the essence presents
itself as actual nature; on the one hand, nature belongs to consciousness as possession
and property, and amounts to the Being-there that is not in itself; on the other hand,
nature is    consciousness’s own         immediate actuality and singularity, which it equally
regards as inessential and sublates. But for its pure consciousness, this external nature
has at the same time the opposite significance, the significance, namely, of being the
essence that is in itself, to which the Self sacrifices its inessentiality, just as, conversely,
it sacrifices the unessential aspect of nature to itself. The action is thereby a spiritual
movement, because it is two-sided: on the one hand, it sublates the abstraction of the
essence (in the way in which devotion determines the object) and makes it actual,
while on the other hand, it sublates the                  actual    (in the way in which the agent
determines the object and himself) and elevates it to universality.1
   ¶718. The action of the cult itself therefore begins with the pure                         surrender   of a
possession which the owner, seemingly with no profit at all to himself, pours away or
lets rise up in smoke. In so doing, before the essence of his pure consciousness he
renounces possession and right of property and of the enjoyment of it, renounces
personality and the return of his doing into the Self; and he reflects the action into the
universal or into the essence, rather than into himself.—But conversely the essence
that simply is also perishes in this action. The animal that is sacrificed is the sign of a
god; the fruits that are consumed are the living Ceres and Bacchus themselves;—in the
animal, the powers of the higher right, which has blood and actual life, die; in the
fruits, die the powers of the lower right, which bloodlessly possesses the secret
cunning power.—The sacrifice of the divine substance, insofar as it is doing, belongs
to the self-conscious side; for this actual doing to be possible, the essence must
already have sacrificed itself in itself. This it has done by giving itself Being-there and
making itself into a        singular animal         and into     fruit. This renunciation, which the
essence has thus already accomplished in itself, the acting Self displays in Being-there
and for his consciousness, and replaces that immediate actuality of the essence by the
higher actuality, viz. the actuality of himself. For the unity that has arisen, which is the
result of the sublated singularity and separation of the two sides, is not merely a
negative fate, but has a positive significance. It is only to the abstract subterranean
essence that the sacrificial offering is wholly surrendered, and the reflection of the
---
     (.) 

possession and of Being-for-self into the universal is marked as distinct from the Self
as such. But at the same time this is only a small part, and the rest of the sacrifice is
merely the destruction of what cannot be used and rather the preparation of the
offering for a meal, the feast that cheats the action out of its negative significance. At
that  first sacrifice, the person making the offering reserves the greatest share, and
from the latter sacrifice he keeps what is useful for his enjoyment. This enjoyment is
the negative power which sublates both the essence and the singularity, and it is at the
same time the positive actuality in which the                 objective Being-there of the essence is
transformed into
unity with the essence.1self-conscious     Being-there, and the Self has consciousness of its
   ¶719. Incidentally, although this cult is an actual action, its significance lies mostly
just in devotion; what pertains to devotion is not objectively produced, just as the
result, in the    enjoyment, divests itself of its Being-there. The cult, therefore, goes
further and repairs this deficiency initially by giving its devotion an                       objective sub-
sistence, since the cult is the common task or the singular task that everyone can do, a
task that produces the dwelling and the adornment of the god in his honour.—In this
way, on the one hand the objectivity of the statue is sublated; for by this dedication of
his gifts and labours the labourer makes the god favourable to him, and contemplates
his Self as belonging to the god; on the other hand too, this doing is not the singular
labour of the artist: this particularity is dissolved in universality. But it is not only the
honour of the god that comes about, and the blessing of his favour is not shed on
the labourer only in representation: the labour has also a significance the reverse of
the first, which was that of estrangement and of alien honour. The dwellings and halls
of the god are for the use of man, the treasures stored in them are his own in time of
need; the honour enjoyed by the god in his adornment is the honour of the artistic
and magnanimous people. At the festival, this people also adorns its own dwellings
and garments, as well as its performances, with graceful furnishings. In this way, it
receives from the grateful god a return for their gifts and proofs of his favour, in
which through their labour they became united with him, not in hope and in an
actualization after the event, but rather, in witnessing to his honour and in offering
gifts, the people has immediately the enjoyment of its own wealth and adornment.1

¶720. The people that approaches its god in the cult of the religion of art is the ethical
people that knows its State and the actions of the State as the will and the accom-
plishment of its own self. This spirit, confronting the self-conscious people, is
therefore not the light-essence, which, devoid of Self, does not contain within it the
certainty of the singletons, but is only their universal essence and the imperious
power in which they disappear. The cult of the religion of this simple, shapeless
essence gives back to its votaries, therefore, nothing at all except that they are the
people of their god; the cult secures for them only their subsistence and their simple
substance in general, not, however, their actual Self which, on the contrary, is
rejected. For they revere their god as the empty depth, not as spirit. But the cult of
the religion of art, on the other hand, lacks that abstract simplicity of the essence and
therefore its depth. The essence, however, which is immediately united with the Self, is
in itself the spirit and the knowing truth, though not yet the known truth, or the truth
---
                                                                                     .         

that knows itself in its depth. So because the essence here contains the Self, its
appearance is friendly to consciousness, and in the cult consciousness receives not
only the universal justification of its subsistence, but also its conscious Being-there in
the essence itself; just as, conversely, the essence does not have an actuality devoid of
Self, in a rejected people whose substance alone is recognized, but in the people
whose Self is recognized in its substance. 1
   ¶721. Self-consciousness, then, emerges from the cult satisfied in its essence, with
the god lodged in it as its abode. For itself this abode is the night of substance or its
pure individuality, but no longer the tense individuality of the artist, an individuality
which has not yet reconciled itself with its essence that is becoming objective; it is the
satisfied night which has its pathos within it and its needs fulfilled, because it returns
from intuition, from sublated objectivity.—This pathos is, for itself, the essence of the
rising sun, but this essence has now               descended      into itself, and has within itself its
sundown, self-consciousness, and hence Being-there and actuality.—The essence has
here run through the movement of its actualization. Descending from its pure
essentiality to an objective force of nature and the expressions of that force, it is a
Being-there for the other, for the Self, by which it is consumed. The silent essence of
selfless nature reaches in its fruit the stage where, preparing itself and digested, it
offers itself to selfish life; in its utility as food and drink nature attains its highest
perfection; for in this it is the possibility of a higher existence and makes contact with
spiritual Being-there;—in its metamorphosis, the earth-spirit has advanced partly to
the silently powerful substance, but partly to spiritual fermentation, in the first case to
the feminine principle of nourishment, in the other to the masculine principle of the
self-impelling force of self-conscious Being-there.1
   ¶722. In this enjoyment, then, that rising light-essence is exposed for what it is;
enjoyment is the mystery of this essence. For the mystical is not concealment of a
secret, or ignorance, but consists in the fact that the Self knows itself at one with the
essence and that the essence is thus revealed. Only the Self is manifest to itself; or
what is manifest is so only in the immediate certainty of itself. But it is in this
immediate certainty that the simple essence has been posited by the cult; as a thing
that can be used the essence not only has a Being-there that is seen, felt, smelt, tasted,
but it is also an object of desire, and through the actual enjoyment becomes one
with the Self and thereby completely exposed to the Self and manifest to it.—That
which is said to be manifest to reason, to the heart, is in fact still secret, for the
actual certainty of immediate Being-there is still lacking, objective certainty as well as
the certainty of enjoyment, a certainty which in religion, however, is not merely
thoughtless and immediate, but is at the same time the purely knowing certainty
of the Self.1
   ¶723. What has thus, through the cult, become manifest to self-conscious spirit
within itself, is the      simple essence, as the movement in which, on the one hand, it
emerges from its nocturnal concealment up into consciousness, there to be its silently
nourishing substance, while, on the other hand, it also loses itself again in the sub-
terranean night, in the Self, and lingers above only with a silent maternal yearning.—
But the lucid impulse is the many-named light-essence of the rising sun, and its
tumultuous life which, likewise relinquished by its abstract Being, at first deals with the
objective Being-there of the fruit, and then, surrendering to self-consciousness, attains
---
     (.) 

to genuine actuality in it,—and now roams about as a horde of frenzied women, the
unrestrained revelry of nature in self-conscious shape.1
    ¶724. But what is disclosed to consciousness is still only absolute spirit, which
is this simple essence, not spirit as the spirit within its own self; or it is only the
immediate       spirit, the spirit of nature. Its self-conscious life is therefore only the
mystery of bread and wine, of Ceres and Bacchus, not of the other, the strictly higher,
gods whose individuality includes, as an essential moment, self-consciousness as
such. So spirit has not yet sacrificed itself as self-conscious spirit to self-consciousness,
and the mystery of bread and wine is not yet the mystery of flesh and blood. 1
    ¶725. This unruly revelry of the god must settle down to become an object, and the
enthusiasm which did not attain to consciousness must produce a work confronting
it, as the statue confronted the enthusiasm of the foregoing artist, a work that is
equally complete of course, only not as an intrinsically lifeless Self, but as a                         living
Self.—Such a cult is the festival which man presents to himself in his own honour,
though not yet conferring on this sort of cult the significance of the absolute essence;
for it is the essence that is manifest to him at first, not yet spirit; not as an essence that
essentially takes on human shape. But this cult lays the foundation for this revelation
and sets out its moments one by one. So here the abstract                          moment of the living
corporeality     of the essence, just as previously the unity of the two in unconscious
enthusiasm. Man thus puts himself in the place of the statue as the shape that has
been reared and elaborated for perfectly free movement, just as the statue is perfectly
free repose. If each singleton knows how to play at least the part of a torch-bearer,
then one of them comes forward who is the shaped movement, the smooth elabor-
ation and fluid force of all the members;—an ensouled, living work of art that couples
strength with its beauty; and on him is bestowed, as a reward for his force, the
decoration with which the statue was honoured, and the honour, among his people,
of being, in place of the god in stone, the highest bodily presentation of their essence.1
    ¶726. In both of the presentations that have just come before us there is present the
unity of self-consciousness and the spiritual essence; but their equilibrium is still
lacking. In Bacchic enthusiasm the Self is beside itself, but in corporeal beauty the
spiritual essence is beside itself. The stupor of consciousness and its wild stammering
in the former must be taken up into the clear Being-there of the latter, and the
spiritless clarity of the latter must be taken up into the inwardness of the former. The
perfect element in which inwardness is just as external as externality is inward is
once again language, but neither the language of the oracle, wholly contingent and
singular in its content, nor the sentimental hymn praising only the singular god, nor
the stammering of Bacchic frenzy, devoid of content. No, it has acquired its lucid
and universal content: its lucid content, because the artist has worked his way out of
the initial, wholly substantial enthusiasm into a shape that is his own Being-there,
permeated in all its vibrations by the self-conscious soul and living in harmony;—its
universal content, for in this festival, which is the honour of man, the one-sidedness
of the statues, which contain only a national spirit, only a determinate character of
divinity, disappears. The handsome warrior is indeed the honour of his particular
people, but he is a corporeal singularity, in which the fulness and seriousness of
significance and the inner character of the spirit that bears the particular life,
concerns, needs, and customs of his people, have disappeared. In this estrangement
---
                                                                                    .           

into complete corporeality, spirit has discarded the particular impressions and
resonances of nature that, as the actual spirit of the people, it encompassed. Its
people is, therefore, no longer conscious in this spirit of its particularity but conscious
rather of having laid this aside and of the universality of its human Being-there.1

¶727. The national spirits which become conscious of the shape of their essence in a
particular animal coalesce into one spirit; thus the particular beautiful national spirits
unite into a single pantheon, the element and dwelling of which is language. The pure
intuition of itself as universal humanity has, in the actuality of the national spirit, this
form: the national spirit combines with the others, with which it constitutes through
nature a single nation, for a common undertaking, and for this work forms a
complete people and therewith a complete heaven. This universality, to which spirit
in its Being-there attains, is, however, only this first universality which                       first issues
from the individuality of the ethical, which has not yet overcome its immediacy, has
not yet formed a single State out of these populations. The ethical life of the actual
national spirit rests partly on the immediate trust of the singletons in their people as a
whole, partly on the immediate share which all, regardless of differences of rank, take
in the resolutions and actions of the government. In the union, which to begin with is
not a permanent arrangement but only for a common action, that freedom of
participation by each and everyone is, for the time being, put on one side. This first
community is therefore more an assembly of individualities than the dominion of
abstract thought, which would rob the singletons of their self-conscious participation
in the will and deed of the whole.1
    ¶728. The gathering of the national spirits constitutes a circle of shapes which now
embraces the whole of nature as well as the whole ethical world. They stand, too,
under the      supreme command of the one, rather than under his supreme dominion.
For themselves they are the universal substances of what the self-conscious essence in
itself  is and does. But this essence constitutes the force and initially at least the
midpoint on which the endeavours of those universal essences turn, and which at
first seems to combine their enterprises only contingently. But it is the return of the
divine essence into self-consciousness that already contains the reason why this
essence forms the midpoint for those divine forces and conceals the essential unity,
initially, under the form of a friendly, external relation of the two worlds.1
    ¶729. The form of the consciousness, in which the content arises, also necessarily
has the same universality that pertains to this content itself. Consciousness is no
longer the actual doing of the cult, but a doing that is elevated, not yet indeed into the
concept, but at first into representation, into the synthetic linkage of self-conscious
Being-there and external Being-there. The Being-there of this representation,                              lan-
guage, is the first language, the epos as such, which contains the universal content, at
least as completeness of the world, though not as the universality of thought. The bard
is the singular and the actual entity, from which, as the subject of this world, the
world is engendered and borne. His pathos is not the stupefying power of nature but
Mnemosyne, reflection and the inwardness that has come about, the recollection of
the formerly immediate essence. He is the organ that vanishes in its content; what
counts is not his own Self but his Muse, his universal song. But what is in fact present
---
     (.) 

is the syllogism in which the extreme of universality, the world of gods, is linked
with singularity, with the bard, through the middle term of particularity. The middle
term is the people in its heroes, who are singular men like the bard, but only
represented, and thereby at the same time universal, like the free extreme of univer-
sality, the gods.1
    ¶730. In this epic, then, what comes about in itself in the cult, the relation of the
divine to the human, presents             itself in general to consciousness. The content is an
action    of the essence conscious of itself. The acting               disturbs the tranquillity of the
substance and excites the essence so that its simplicity is divided and opened up into
the variegated world of natural and ethical forces. The action is the wound of the
peaceful earth, the pit which, ensouled by blood, evokes the departed spirits, who,
thirsting for life, obtain it in the doing of self-consciousness. The enterprise on which
the universal endeavour turns has two sides: the selfish side, where the enterprise is
accomplished by a totality of actual peoples and the individualities standing at their
head, and the universal side, where it is accomplished by their substantial powers. But
the   relation   of the two sides determined itself earlier like this: it is the                    synthetic
combination of the universal and singular, or representation. On this determinacy the
judgement of this world depends.—The relationship of the two is thus a mixture,
which shares out the unity of the doing in an inconsistent way, and superfluously
switches the action over from one side to the other. The universal powers have the
shape of individuality and hence the principle of action in them; their operation
appears, therefore, as a free doing, proceeding entirely from them, just as much as
that of men. Consequently, one and the same thing has been done both by the gods
and by men. The earnestness of those powers is a ridiculous superfluity, since these
powers are in fact the force of the acting individuality;—and the exertion and labour
of the individuality is an equally useless effort, since it is rather the powers who
manage everything. Ephemeral mortals, who are nothing, are at the same time the
powerful Self that subjugates the universal essences, offends the gods, and in general
procures actuality for them and an interest in the doing; while conversely, these
impotent universalities, who nourish themselves on the gifts of men and through
them alone get something to do, are the natural essence and the stuff of all the events,
and also the ethical matter and the pathos of the doing. If their elemental natures are
first brought into actuality and activated relationship by the free Self of individuality,
they are equally the universal that withdraws from this connection, that remains
unrestricted in its determination, and through the invincible elasticity of its unity
effaces the punctuality of the active party and its figurations, keeps itself pure and
dissolves everything individual in its fluidity. 1
    ¶731. Just as the gods fall into this contradictory relation with the selfish nature
opposed to their own, so too their universality comes into conflict with their own
determination and its relationship to others. They are the eternal, beautiful individ-
uals who, reposing in their own Being-there, are exempt from transience and alien
power.—But at the same time they are determinate                       elements, particular       gods, who
therefore enter into relationship to others. But the relationship to others which, in
virtue of its opposition, is a conflict with them, is a comical self-forgetfulness of their
eternal nature.—The determinacy is rooted in the divine subsistence and has in
its limitation the independence of the whole individuality; at the same time because
---
                                                                                  .           

of this independence their characters lose the sharpness of peculiarity and blend
together in their ambiguity.—One purpose of the activity, and their activity itself,
since it is directed against an other, and hence against an invincible divine force, is a
contingent and empty bravado, which at once melts away and transforms the
seeming earnestness of the action into a risk-free, self-assured play, without result
or outcome. But if in the nature of their divinity the negative or the determinacy of
this nature appears merely as the inconsequence of their activity and the contradic-
tion between purpose and outcome, and if that independent security retains the
preponderance over the determinate, then by that very fact the                         pure force     of the
negative    confronts it, and, moreover, as the ultimate power over them and about
which they can do nothing. They are the universal and the positive over against the
singular Self of mortals which does not hold out against their power; but the universal
Self, for that reason, hovers over them and over this whole world of representation to
which the entire content belongs, as the unconceptual void of necessity,—a happening
which they face selflessly and sorrowfully, for these determinate natures do not find
themselves in this purity.1
   ¶732. But this necessity is the unity             of the   concept, to which the contradictory
substantiality of the singular moments is subjugated, in which the inconsequence and
contingency of their doing get in good order and the play of their actions acquires its
earnestness and worth in the actions themselves. The content of the world of
representation unrestrainedly plays its movement for itself in the                           middle term,
assembled around the individuality of a hero who, however, in his strength and
beauty feels his life broken and sorrowfully expects an early death. For the intrinsic-
ally  firm and actual singularity is banished to the extremity and split up into its
moments which have not yet found and unified themselves. One singleton, the
abstract non-actual, is necessity, which does not participate in the life of the middle
term, no more than the other does, the                    actual   singleton, the bard, who keeps
outside it and is lost in his representation. Both extremes must draw near to the
content; one of them, the necessity, has to                 fill itself with the content, while the
other, the language of the bard, must participate in it; and the content formerly left
to itself must receive in it the certainty and the fixed determination of the negative. 1
   ¶733. This higher language, tragedy, thus brings closer together the dispersion of
the moments of the essential world and the world of action; the                         substance     of the
divine sunders into its shapes in accordance with the nature of the concept, and their
movement likewise conforms to the concept. In regard to form, the language ceases
to be narrative because it enters into the content, and the content ceases to be an
imaginatively represented content. The hero is himself the speaker, and the repre-
sentation shows to the audience—who are also spectators—self-conscious                              human
beings who       know    their right and their purpose, the power and the will of their
determinacy, and know how to say it. They are artists, who do not express uncon-
sciously, naturally and naively the external aspect of their resolution and undertak-
ing, like the language accompanying ordinary doing in actual life: they give outward
voice to the inner essence, they demonstrate the right of their actions, and they
reflectively affirm and determinately express the pathos that possesses them, in its
universal individuality, free from contingent circumstances and from the particular-
ity of personalities. Finally, it is actual human beings who are the Being-there of these
---
     (.) 

characters, human beings who assume the personae of the heroes and portray them
in actual speech, not narrative speech, but in their own speech. Just as it is essential
for the statue to be the work of human hands, so the actor is essential to his mask,—
not as an external condition from which we must abstract when viewing art;—or
insofar as we nevertheless have to abstract from it in the art, this amounts to saying
that the art does not yet contain the true authentic Self.1
    ¶734. The      universal terrain on which the movement of these shapes generated
from the concept proceeds, is the consciousness of the                       first representational lan-
guage and its selfless content, abandoned to its dispersion. It is the common people in
general whose wisdom finds expression in the chorus of the ancients; in the weakness
of the chorus the people has its representative, because the common people itself
constitutes merely the positive and passive material of the individuality of the
government confronting it. Lacking the power of the negative, it is unable to hold
together and subdue the riches and varied abundance of the divine life, but lets it drift
apart, and in its reverential hymns it extols each singular moment as an independent
god, first one and then again another. But where it discerns the earnestness of the
concept—how it smashes these shapes to pieces as it marches on above them—and
comes to see how ill it fares with its venerated gods who venture onto this territory
where the concept holds sway, then it is not itself the negative power that actively
intervenes; it keeps to the selfless thought of such power, to the consciousness of an
alien fate, and introduces the empty wish for tranquillity and feeble talk of appease-
ment. In its fear of the higher powers which are the immediate arms of the substance,
its fear of their struggle among themselves, and of the simple Self of necessity which
crushes them as well as the living beings linked with them;—in its compassion for
these living beings which at the same time it knows to be the same as itself, there is for
the people only the paralysing dread of this movement, only the equally helpless pity,
and as the end of it all, the empty repose of submission to necessity, whose work is
not grasped as the necessary action of the character, nor as the activity of the absolute
essence within itself.1
    ¶735. For this consciousness of the spectator, as the indifferent terrain of repre-
sentation, spirit does not enter the scene in its dispersed multiplicity, but in the
simple partition of the concept. Its substance therefore shows itself torn asunder
merely into its two extreme powers. These elemental                       universal    essences are at the
same time self-conscious           individualities,—heroes, who posit their consciousness in
one of these powers, have in it determinacy of character and constitute the operation
and actuality of these powers.—This universal individualization descends again, as
we have mentioned, to the immediate actuality of authentic Being-there and presents
itself to a crowd of spectators who have in the chorus their counterpart, or rather the
expression of their own representation.1
    ¶736. The content and movement of spirit, which here is object to itself, has
already been considered as the nature and realization of the ethical substance. In its
religion, this spirit attains to consciousness of itself, or presents itself to its conscious-
ness in its purer form and simpler configuration. So if the ethical substance, in virtue
of its concept and in accordance with its content, divided into the two powers which
were determined as divine right and               human right, or right of the nether world and
right of the upper world—the former the family, the latter the State power,—and the
---
                                                                                    .          

first of which was the          feminine    and the second the          masculine character, then the
previously multiform circle of gods, fluctuating in its determinations, confines itself
to these powers which in virtue of this determination come closer to genuine
individuality. For the earlier dispersion of the whole into manifold and abstract
forces, which appear substantialized, is the dissolution of the subject, which compre-
hends them only as moments within its Self, and therefore individuality is merely the
superficial form of these essences. Conversely, a further distinction of characters, in
addition to the one we have mentioned, is to be attributed to contingent and in itself
external personality.1
    ¶737. At the same time, the essence divides with respect to its form or to knowledge.
The acting spirit confronts as consciousness the object on which it is active and which
is thus determined as the negative of the knower; the agent is thereby involved in the
opposition of knowing and not-knowing. He derives his purpose from his character
and knows it as the ethical essentiality; but in virtue of the determinacy of his
character he knows only the             one power of substance, the other remaining hidden
from him. The actuality present is therefore one thing in itself, and another thing for
consciousness; the upper right and the nether right in this connection acquire the
meaning of the power that knows and reveals itself to consciousness, and the power
that conceals itself and lurks in ambush. The                    one   is the  side of light, the god of
the oracle who, in accordance with his natural moment, has sprung from the all-
illuminating sun, knows all and reveals all,—Phoebus, and Zeus who is his father. But
the commands of this truth-speaking god, and his proclamations of what is, are really
deceptive.1     For this knowing is, in its concept, immediately not-knowing, because
consciousness, in acting, is in itself this opposition. He who was able to solve the
riddle of the sphinx itself,2           and he who trusted with childlike confidence, 3                    are
therefore sent to destruction by what the god reveals to them. This priestess through
whom the beautiful god speaks is in no way different from the equivocating sisters of
fate who drive to crime by their promises and who by the double-tongued ambiguity
of what they announced as a certainty deceive him who relied on the manifest sense.4
Therefore the consciousness that is purer than the latter, which believes the witches,
and more prudent and profound than the former, which trusts the priestess and the
beautiful god, hesitates over revenge on receiving a revelation from the spirit of his own
father about the crime that murdered him, and still arranges other proofs,—for the
reason that this revelatory spirit could also be the devil.5
    ¶738. The basis of this mistrust is that the knowing consciousness posits itself
in the opposition between the certainty of itself and the objective essence. The right
of the ethical law, that actuality is            in itself  nothing in opposition to the absolute
law, learns by experience that its knowledge is one-sided, its law only a law of its
character, that it latched onto only one of the powers of the substance. The action
itself is this inversion of what is known into its contrary, into Being, the turnabout of
the right of character and of knowledge into the right of the opposite with which the
former is bound up in the essence of the substance—a turnabout into the Erinyes of
the other power and character aroused to hostility. This nether right sits with Zeus on
the throne and enjoys equal authority with the god who is revealed and who knows.1
    ¶739. The world of the gods of the chorus is restricted to these three essences by
the acting individuality. One of them is the substance, the power of the hearth and the
---

spirit of family piety, as well as the universal power of the State and the government.
This distinction, since it belongs to the substance as such, does not individualize itself
for representation into two distinct shapes, but has in actuality the two persons of its
characters. On the other hand, the distinction between knowing and not-knowing
falls within    each of the actual self-consciousnesses—and only in abstraction, in the
element of universality, does it apportion itself to two individual shapes. For the Self
of the hero has Being-there only as a whole consciousness and is therefore essentially
the whole of the distinction belonging to the form; but its substance is determinate
and only one side of the distinction of the content belongs to him. Therefore, while in
actuality neither of the two sides of consciousness has a separate individuality of its
own, in the      representation each of them receives its own particular shape, one the
shape of the revelatory god, the other the shape of the Erinyes who keep themselves
concealed. On the one hand, both enjoy equal honour, while on the other hand, the
shape    of the   substance, Zeus, is the necessity of the                relation   of the two to each
other. The substance is the relation where the knowledge is for itself, but has its
truth in the simple; where the distinction, through which actual consciousness is, has
its ground in the inner essence that annihilates the distinction; and where the clear
self-assurance of certainty has its confirmation in oblivion. 1
    ¶740. Consciousness disclosed this opposition through action; acting in accord-
ance with the revealed knowledge it learns by experience the deception of this
knowledge, and being devoted as regards the content to one of the attributes of
substance, it violated the other attribute and so gave it the right against itself. In
following the god who knows, it instead got hold of what was not revealed, and
atones for having trusted a knowledge whose ambiguity, since such is its nature,
should have been present for consciousness as well, and should have been a warning
against it. The frenzy of the priestess, the inhuman shape of the witches, the voice of
the tree and the bird, the dream and so forth, are not the ways in which truth appears;
they are warning signs of deception, of lack of self-possession, of the singularity and
contingency of the knowledge. Or, what is the same thing, the opposite power which
is violated by consciousness is present as express law and valid right, whether it be
law of the family or of the State; consciousness, on the contrary, followed its own
knowledge and concealed from itself what was revealed. The truth, however, of the
antagonistic powers of the content and consciousness is the result that both are
equally in the right, and therefore in their opposition, which is brought about by
action, are equally in the wrong. The movement of the doing demonstrates their
unity in the mutual downfall of the two powers and of the self-conscious characters.
The reconciliation of the opposition with itself is the                    Lethe   of the   underworld   in
death,—or the Lethe of the upper world, as absolution, not from guilt (for conscious-
ness, since it acted, cannot deny guilt), but absolution from crime, and its expiatory
appeasement. Both are oblivion, the disappearance of the actuality and the doing of
the powers of substance, of their individualities, and of the powers of the abstract
thought of good and evil; for none of them for itself is the essence; the essence is
rather the repose of the whole within itself, the immobile unity of fate, the calm
Being-there and consequent inactivity and lack of vitality of family and government,
and the equal honour and consequent indifferent unactuality of Apollo and the
Erinyes, and the return of their spirituality and activity into simple Zeus.1

    ¶741. This fate completes the depopulation of heaven,—of the thoughtless min-
gling of individuality and essence,—a mingling whereby the doing of the essence
appears as inconsequent, contingent, unworthy of itself; for individuality that is only
superficially attached to the essence is unessential individuality. The expulsion of
such essenceless representations, which was demanded by the philosophers of
antiquity, thus already begins in tragedy in general in virtue of the fact that the
division of the substance is governed by the concept, and consequently individuality
is essential individuality, and the determinations are the absolute characters. The self-
consciousness that is represented in tragedy therefore knows and acknowledges only
one supreme power, and knows and acknowledges this Zeus only as the power of
the State or of the hearth, and, in the opposition pertaining to knowledge, only as the
father of the knowledge of the particular that is taking shape,—and as the Zeus of the
oath and of the Erinyes, of the universal, of the interior dwelling in concealment. On
the other hand, the further moments dispersing from the concept into representa-
tion, moments which the chorus emphasizes one after the other, are not the pathos of
the hero; they sink to the level of passion in him,—to contingent, essenceless
moments which the selfless chorus praises, but are not capable of constituting the
character of heroes, nor of being expressed and esteemed by them as their essence.1
    ¶742. But also the persons of the divine essence itself, as well as the characters of its
substance, coalesce into the simplicity of the unconscious. Vis-à-vis self-consciousness
this necessity has the determination of being the negative power of all the shapes that
arise, a power in which they do not recognize themselves but rather perish in it. The
Self arises only as assigned to the characters, not as the centre of the movement. But
self-consciousness, the simple certainty of oneself, is in fact the negative power, the
unity of Zeus, of the substantial essence and of abstract necessity; it is the spiritual unity
into which everything returns. Because actual self-consciousness is still distinguished
from the substance and from fate, it is on the one hand the chorus, or rather the crowd
of spectators, whom this movement of the divine life, as something alien, fills with fear,
or in whom this movement, as something near to them, produces only the emotion of
helpless compassion. On the other hand, insofar as consciousness joins in the action
and belongs to the characters, this unification is an external unification, a hypocrisy,
because the true unification, that of the Self, fate, and substance, is not yet present; the
hero who appears before the spectator splits up into his mask and the actor, into the
persona and the actual Self.1
    ¶743. The self-consciousness of the heroes must step forth from its mask and
display itself as knowing itself to be the fate both of the gods of the chorus and of the
absolute powers themselves, and as being no longer separated from the chorus, from
the universal consciousness.1
    ¶744. Thus comedy has, first of all, the aspect that actual self-consciousness displays
itself as the fate of the gods. These elemental essences, as universal moments, are not
a Self and not actual. They are, indeed, invested with the form of individuality, but this
is only imaginatively projected onto them and does not pertain to them in and for
themselves; the actual Self does not have such an abstract moment for its substance
and content. It, the subject, is raised above such a moment, as above a singular
property, and attired in this mask it proclaims the irony of this property that purports
to be something for itself. The pretension of universal essentiality is exposed to the
---
     (.) 

Self; the Self shows itself caught up in an actuality, and drops the mask just because it
wants to be something straight. The Self, presenting itself here in its significance as
something actual, plays with the mask which it once puts on in order to be its
persona,—but it dispels this illusion right away and stands exposed in its own
nakedness and ordinariness, which it shows to be not distinct from the Self proper,
from the actor as well as the spectator.1
   ¶745. This universal dissolution of essentiality in general, when it takes the shape
of individuality, becomes in its content more serious and thus more petulant and
more bitter insofar as the content has its more serious and more necessary signifi-
cance. The divine substance unites within it the significance of natural and ethical
essentiality. As regards the natural element, actual self-consciousness already shows
in its employment of it for its adornment, for its dwelling, etc., and in the feast of its
sacrifice, that it is itself the fate to which is betrayed the secret about the case of the
self-essentiality of nature; in the mystery of bread and wine, it makes this self-
essentiality its own, along with the meaning of the inner essence, and in comedy, it
is fully conscious of the irony of this meaning.—Now insofar as this meaning
contains ethical essentiality, it is partly the people in its two aspects, that of the
State or the demos proper, and that of family singularity, but partly it is self-
conscious pure knowledge or the rational thinking of the universal.—This                              demos,
the universal mass, which knows itself as master and regent, and also as the
understanding and insight which demand respect, constrains and dupes itself
through the particularity of its actuality, and exhibits the ludicrous contrast between
its opinion of itself and its immediate Being-there, between its necessity and contin-
gency, its universality and vulgarity. If the principle of its singularity, separated from
the universal, thrusts forward in the authentic shape of actuality and openly usurps
the commonwealth, whose secret bane it is, and administers it, then the contrast
between the universal as a theory and what we have to deal with in practice betrays
itself more immediately, the complete emancipation of the aims of immediate
singularity from the universal order, and the contempt of singularity for that order.1
   ¶746. Rational thinking delivers the divine essence from its contingent shape and,
in opposition to the unconceptual wisdom of the chorus which advances all sorts of
ethical saws and gives currency to a host of laws and determinate concepts of duty
and of right, raises them up into the simple Ideas of the beautiful and the good.—The
movement of this abstraction is the consciousness of the dialectic that these maxims
and laws have in them, and consequently the consciousness of the vanishing of the
absolute validity in which they formerly appeared. With the vanishing of the con-
tingent determination and superficial individuality which representation lent to the
divine essentialities, all they still have on their natural side is the nakedness of their
immediate Being-there; they are clouds, an evanescent mist, like those representa-
tions. When their essentialness has been refined by                    thinking and accordingly they
have become the simple thoughts of the beautiful and the good, they tolerate being
filled with any content whatsoever. The force of dialectical knowledge surrenders the
determinate laws and maxims of action to the pleasure and frivolity of youth led
astray—by it—and supplies weapons of deception to the anxiety and care of old age,
restricted as it is to the singularity of life. The pure thoughts of the beautiful and the
good thus display a comic spectacle: through their liberation from the opinion which
---
                                                                                    .            

contains both their determinacy as content and also their absolute determinacy, the
firm hold of consciousness, they become empty, and for that very reason the
plaything of opinion and the wilfulness of contingent individuality.1
    ¶747. So the formerly unconscious fate, which consists in empty repose and oblivion,
and is separated from self-consciousness, is here united with self-consciousness. The
singular Self is the negative force through which and in which the gods, and also
their moments—nature as being-there and the thoughts of their determinations—
disappear; at the same time, the singular Self is not the emptiness of disappear-
ance, but preserves itself in this very nothingness, is at home with itself and is the
sole actuality. The religion of art has consummated itself in it and has completely
returned into itself. In virtue of the fact that it is the singular consciousness in the
certainty of itself that presents itself as this absolute power, this power has lost the
form of something           represented, something altogether               separated      from    conscious-
ness and alien to it, as were the statue, also the living and beautiful corporeality, or
the content of the epic and the powers and persons of tragedy;—the unity, too, is
not the unconscious unity of the cult and the mysteries, but the authentic Self of
the actor coincides with his persona, just like the spectator, who is completely at
home in what is represented to him and sees himself playing in it. What this self-
consciousness intuitively beholds is that what assumes the form of essentiality
confronting it, instead dissolves in it and is surrendered to its mercy in its
thinking, its Being-there, and its doing; it is the return of everything universal
into the certainty of itself, and this certainty is, in consequence, this complete lack
of terror, this complete lack of essence on the part of everything alien, and a well-
being and contentment of consciousness, such as is no longer to be found outside
this comedy.1
C. The revealed religion
¶748. Through the religion of art, spirit has passed from the form of substance into
the form of subject, for the religion of art produces the shape of the subject and thus
posits in this shape the          activity or the self-consciousness that, in the dreadful sub-
stance, simply vanishes and does not apprehend its own Self in its trust. This human
incarnation of the divine essence starts from the statue which has in it only the outer
shape of the Self, while the interior, its activity, falls outside it; but in the cult the two
sides have become one; and in the result of the religion of art this unity, in its
completion, has at the same time also passed over to the extreme of the Self; in spirit,
which is completely certain of itself in the singularity of consciousness, all essentiality
is submerged. The proposition that expresses this light-heartedness runs thus: the Self
is the absolute essence; the essence, which was substance and in which the Self was
accidentality, has sunk to the level of a predicate; and in this self-consciousness, which
nothing confronts in the form of essence, spirit has lost its consciousness. 1
    ¶749. This proposition:          the Self is the absolute essence, belongs, self-evidently, to
the non-religious spirit, to the actual spirit; and we have to recall which is the shape of
spirit that expresses it. This shape will contain at the same time the movement of the
proposition and its inversion, which reduces the Self to the predicate and elevates
substance to the subject. This happens in the following way: the inverse proposition

way, reinstate substance in such a manner that spirit’s consciousness is led back to its
beginning, to natural religion; on the contrary, this inversion is brought about for and
by self-consciousness itself. Since self-consciousness abandons itself with conscious-
ness, it is preserved in its estrangement and remains the subject of substance, but
as it is also estranged from itself, it has consciousness of substance at the same time;
or since self-consciousness by its sacrifice produces                                       the substance as subject, this
subject remains its own Self. This gives rise to the following result: if, in the two
propositions,—in that of the first substantiality, the subject just vanishes,—and in
the second, substance is only a predicate, and both sides are thus present in each
proposition with an opposite inequality of value,—then the result is the union
and interpenetration of the two natures, in which both are, with equal value, just
as essential and both are only moments as well; in this way spirit is both conscious-

    ¶750. The religion of art belongs to the ethical spirit which we earlier saw perish in
the state of right, i.e. in the proposition: the Self as such, the abstract person, is absolute
essence. In the ethical life, the Self is submerged in the spirit of its people, it is
universality         filled. But        simple singularity              arises out of this content, and its levity
refines it into a person, into the abstract universality of right. In this universality the
reality of the ethical spirit is lost and, empty of content, the spirits of the national
individuals are gathered into a single pantheon, not a pantheon of representation
whose powerless form lets each spirit go its own way, but the pantheon of abstract
universality, of pure thought, which disembodies them and assigns Being in- and for-
itself to the spiritless Self, to the singular person.1
    ¶751. But this Self has, through its emptiness, let the content go free; consciousness
is the essence only within itself; its own Being-there, the juridical recognition of the
person, is the unfilled abstraction; it possesses, therefore, rather only the thought of
itself; or as it        is there and knows itself as object, it is the consciousness that is                                            not
actual. Hence it is only the stoical independence of thinking, and this, passing through
the movement of the sceptical consciousness, finds its truth in that shape which was
called the unhappy self-consciousness.1
    ¶752. This self-consciousness knows all about the actual validity of the abstract
person and all about its validity in pure thought. It knows that such a validity is rather
a complete loss; it is itself this conscious loss of itself and the estrangement of its
knowledge of itself.—We see that this unhappy consciousness constitutes the coun-
terpart and completion of the consciousness that is perfectly happy within itself, the
comic consciousness. Into the latter consciousness all the divine essence returns, or it
is the complete estrangement of substance. The unhappy consciousness, on the other
hand, is conversely the tragic fate of the certainty of itself that is supposed to be in and
for itself. It is the consciousness of the loss of all essentiality in this certainty of itself,
and the loss in fact of this knowledge of itself—the loss of substance as well as of the
Self, it is the grief that expresses itself in the harsh words: God is dead.1
    ¶753. In the state of right, then, the ethical world and the religion of that world
are submerged in the comic consciousness, and the unhappy consciousness is
the knowledge of this                   total    loss. It has lost the self-worth both of its immediate
personality and of its mediated personality, its personality in                                            thought. The oracles

that imparted knowledge of the particular have fallen silent, and so likewise has trust
in the eternal laws of the gods. The statues are now corpses from which the animating
soul has flown, just as the hymns are words which faith has deserted; the tables of the
gods are without spiritual food and drink, and from its games and festivals con-
sciousness does not get in return the joyful unity of itself with the essence. The works
of the muse lack the force of the spirit, for which the certainty of itself sprang from
the crushing of gods and men. They are now what they are for us,—beautiful fruit
detached from the tree, a friendly fate offered it to us, as a girl presents the fruit; it
does not give the actual life of their Being-there, not the tree that bore them, not the
earth and the elements which constituted their substance, nor the climate that gave
them their determinacy, or the alternation of the seasons that governed the process of
their growth.—So fate does not give their world to us along with the works of this art,
not the spring and summer of the ethical life in which they bloomed and ripened, but
only the veiled recollection of this actuality.—Our doing in the enjoyment of them is
therefore not the doing of divine worship which would secure for our consciousness
its perfect truth to fill it up; it is the external doing that wipes some drops of rain, say,
or specks of dust off these fruits and, in place of the inner elements of the surround-
ing, engendering, and inspiring actuality of the ethical, erects a vast scaffolding of the
dead elements of their external existence, the language, the historical element, etc.,
not in order to enter into their life but only to represent them within oneself. But
as the girl who offers the plucked fruits is more than their nature that immediately
presented them—nature spread out into their conditions and elements, the tree, air,
light, and so on—because she sums all this up in a higher mode, in the gleam of the
self-conscious eye and in the offering gesture, so too the spirit of the fate that presents
those works of art to us is more than the ethical life and actuality of that people, for it
is the re-collection of the spirit that in them was still externalized,—it is the spirit of
the tragic fate that gathers all those individual gods and attributes of the substance
into the single pantheon, into spirit conscious of itself as spirit.1
   ¶754. All the conditions for its emergence are present, and this totality of its
conditions constitutes the becoming, the concept or the emergence of spirit, an emer-
gence that is in itself.—The circle of the productions of art embraces the forms of the
estrangements of the absolute substance; this substance is in the form of individuality,
as a thing, as an object of sensory consciousness that simply is,—as the pure language
or the becoming of the shape whose Being-there does not go outside the Self, and is
a purely    vanishing object;—as immediate unity with the universal self-consciousness
in its inspiration, and as mediated unity in the doing of cult;—as beautiful, selfish
corporeality; and lastly as the Being-there elevated into representation and the expan-
sion of this Being-there into a world which at last collects itself together into the
universality which is also pure certainty of itself.—These forms, and on the other side
the world of the person and of right, the destructive savagery of the liberated elements
of the content, also the person as thought in Stoicism and the unstable restlessness of
sceptical consciousness, constitute the periphery of the shapes that stand, waiting and
pressing, round the birthplace of spirit as it becomes self-consciousness. The grief and
yearning of the unhappy self-consciousness, which permeates them all, is their centre
and the common birth-pang of its emergence,—the simplicity of the pure concept,
which contains those shapes as its moments.1

    ¶755. The concept has in it the two sides which are represented above as the two
converse propositions; one is this, that                substance     estranges itself from itself and
becomes self-consciousness, the other is conversely, that self-consciousness estranges
itself from itself and makes itself into thinghood or into the universal Self. The two
sides have in this way come to meet each other, and their true union has thereby
arisen. The estrangement of substance, its becoming self-consciousness, expresses
the transition into the opposite, the unconscious transition of necessity, or expresses
the fact that substance is in itself self-consciousness. Conversely, the estrangement of
self-consciousness expresses the fact that it is in itself the universal essence, or—since
the Self is pure Being-for-itself which remains at home with itself in its contrary,—that
it is for self-consciousness that substance is self-consciousness, and is spirit for that very
reason. Of this spirit, which has abandoned the form of substance and enters into
Being-there in the shape of self-consciousness, it may therefore be said—if we wish to
employ relationships derived from natural generation,—that it has an actual mother
but a father that is in itself; for         actuality    or self-consciousness, and the            in-itself  as
substance, are its two moments through whose reciprocal estrangement, each becom-
ing the other, spirit enters into Being-there as their unity.1
    ¶756. Insofar as self-consciousness one-sidedly grasps only its own estrangement,
even though its object is for it thus Being as well as Self and it knows all Being-there
as spiritual essence, nevertheless the true spirit has not yet thereby come to be for it,
insofar, that is, as Being in general, or substance, has not likewise, on its side, in itself
estranged itself and become self-consciousness. For in this case all Being-there is
spiritual essence only from the standpoint of consciousness, not in its own self. Spirit is
in this way only         imaginatively projected          onto Being-there; this imagining is the
enthusiasm which attributes to nature as well as to history, to the world as well as
to the mythical representations of earlier religions, an inner sense other than that
which they immediately present to consciousness in their appearance, and in the case
of religions, a sense other than the one known in them by the self-consciousness
whose religions they were. But this meaning is a borrowed meaning and a garment
that does not cover the nakedness of the appearance and deserves no faith and
reverence; it remains the murky night of consciousness and its own ecstasy.1
    ¶757. So if this meaning of the objective is not to be mere imagination, it must be
in itself, i.e. must,     in the    first place, arise for consciousness from the                concept    and
emerge in its necessity. That is how the self-knowing spirit has arisen for us through
the cognition of immediate consciousness, or of the consciousness of the object that
simply     is, through its necessary movement. This concept which, as immediate, had
also the shape of immediacy for its consciousness, has, in the second place, assumed
the shape of self-consciousness in itself, i.e. by just the same necessity of the concept
by which       Being    or the     immediacy       which is the content-less object of sensory
consciousness, estranges itself and becomes I for consciousness.—But the immediate
in-itself or the necessity that simply is, is itself different from the thinking in-itself or
the cognition of necessity,—a difference, however, that at the same time does not lie
outside the concept, for the simple unity of the concept is immediate Being itself; the
concept is at once what estranges itself or the becoming of intuited necessity, and it is
also at home with itself in this necessity and knows and comprehends it.—The
immediate in-itself        of spirit that assumes the shape of self-consciousness means

                                                                                     .            

nothing else than that the actual world-spirit has attained to this knowledge of itself;
only then does this knowledge also enter its consciousness, and enter it as truth. How
that came about we have already seen.1
   ¶758. That the absolute spirit has assumed the shape of self-consciousness in itself,
and therefore also for its consciousness, now appears thus: that it is the                         faith of the
world    that spirit is there     as a self-consciousness, i.e. as an actual man, that it is for
immediate certainty, that the believing consciousness sees                       and feels    and    hears this
divinity. So this self-consciousness is not imagination, but is actually in him. Con-
sciousness does not start then from                  its  interior, setting out from thought, and
combine within itself the thought of God with Being-there; on the contrary, it starts
from immediate present Being-there and recognizes God in it.—The moment of
immediate Being         is present in the content of the concept in such a way that the
religious spirit, in the return of all essentiality into consciousness, has become a
simple positive Self, just as the actual spirit as such in the unhappy consciousness
became just this simple self-conscious negativity. Because of this, the Self of the spirit
that is there has the form of complete immediacy; it is posited neither as something
thought or represented, nor as something produced, as is the case with the immediate
Self both in natural religion and in the religion of art. On the contrary, this god is
intuited sensorily, immediately as a Self, as an actual singular man; only so is he self-
consciousness.1
   ¶759. This incarnation of the divine essence, or the fact that it essentially and
immediately has the shape of self-consciousness, is the simple content of the absolute
religion. In the absolute religion the essence is known as spirit, or this religion is the
consciousness of the essence about itself, consciousness that it is spirit. For spirit is
the knowledge of itself in its estrangement; the essence that is the movement of
retaining its equality with itself in its otherness. But this is the substance, insofar as in
its accidentality substance is at the same time reflected into itself, not indifferent to it
as something unessential and thus situated in it as in an alien element, but in it
reflected    within itself, i.e. substance insofar as it is              subject   or   Self. Consequently,
in this religion the divine essence is revealed. Its being revealed manifestly consists in
this, that what it is, is known. But it is known precisely in its being known as spirit, as
essence that is essentially         self-consciousness.—For          consciousness there is something
secret in its object if the object is an other or something alien for it, and if it does not
know it as its own self. This secrecy ceases when the absolute essence as spirit is object
of consciousness; for then the object is as a Self in its relationship to consciousness,
i.e. consciousness knows itself immediately in the object, or is manifest to itself in the
object. Consciousness is manifest to itself only in its own certainty of itself; its object
is the Self, but the Self is nothing alien; on the contrary, it is the indissoluble unity
with itself, the immediately universal. The Self is the pure concept, pure thinking or
Being-for-itself, which is immediately Being, and consequently Being for an other, and
as this Being for an other has immediately returned into itself and is at home with
itself; it is thus that which is genuinely and alone revealed. The good, the righteous,
the holy, creator of heaven and earth, and so on, are predicates of a subject—universal
moments which have their support in this point and are only in the return of
consciousness into thinking.—When they are known, their ground and essence, the
subject itself, is not yet revealed; and similarly the determinations of the universal are
---
     (.) 

revealed, not this universal itself. But the subject itself, and consequently this pure
universal too, is revealed as Self, for this Self is just this interior reflected into itself,
which is immediately there and is that Self ’s own self-certainty, the Self for which it is
there. To be what is revealed in accordance with its concept,—this is thus the true
shape of spirit, and this shape, the concept, is likewise its sole essence and substance.
Spirit is known as self-consciousness and to this self-consciousness it is immediately
revealed, for spirit is this self-consciousness itself; the divine nature is the same as
human nature, and it is this unity that is intuited.1
   ¶760. So here consciousness, or the manner in which the essence is for conscious-
ness itself, its shape, is in fact equal to its self-consciousness; this shape is itself a self-
consciousness; it is thus at the same time an object that simply is, and this Being has,
just as immediately, the meaning of                 pure thinking, of the absolute essence.—The
absolute essence, which is there as an actual self-consciousness, seems to have descended
from its eternal simplicity, but in fact it has thereby attained its supreme essence for the
first time. For only when the concept of essence has reached its simple purity is it the
absolute abstraction which is pure thinking, and hence the pure singularity of the Self,
just as in virtue of its simplicity it is the immediate or Being.—What is called sensory
consciousness is just this pure            abstraction, it is this thinking for which               Being, the
immediate, is. Thus the lowest is at the same time the highest; the revealed that has
emerged entirely on the surface is precisely therein the most profound. That the supreme
essence is seen, heard, etc. as a self-consciousness that simply is, is thus in fact the
completion of its concept; and through this completion the essence is immediately there,
as much as it is the essence.1
   ¶761. This immediate Being-there is at the same time not solely and simply
immediate consciousness, it is religious consciousness; the immediacy has insepar-
ably the meaning not only of a self-consciousness that just is, but of the essence purely
in thought or the absolute essence. What we are conscious of in our concept—that
Being is essence—the religious consciousness is conscious of too. This unity of Being
and essence, of thinking which             is immediately Being-there, is the immediate know-
ledge of this religious consciousness, as well as its thought or its mediated knowledge;
for this unity of Being and thinking is               self-consciousness and is itself           there, or the
unity in thought has at the same time this shape of what it is. Thus God is here
revealed    as  he is;  he is there     just as he is      in himself, he is there as spirit. God is
attainable in pure speculative knowledge alone and is only in that knowledge, and is
only that knowledge itself, for he is spirit, and this speculative knowledge is the
knowledge of the revealed religion. Speculative knowledge knows God as thinking or
pure essence, and knows this thinking as Being and as Being-there, and it knows
Being-there as the negativity of itself, hence as Self, as this Self and universal Self; it
is precisely this that the revealed religion knows.—The hopes and expectations of
the preceding world pressed on towards this revelation alone, to intuit what abso-
lute essence is, and in it to find itself; this joy enters self-consciousness and seizes the
whole world, the joy of beholding itself in absolute knowledge; for it is spirit, it is the
simple movement of those pure moments, which expresses this very fact: that only
when the essence is intuited as immediate self-consciousness is it known as spirit. 1
   ¶762. This concept of spirit that knows itself as spirit is itself the immediate
concept and is not yet developed. The essence is spirit, or it has appeared, it is
---
                                                                                   .            

revealed; this first revelation is itself immediate; but the immediacy is equally pure
mediation or thinking; it must therefore exhibit this in its own Self as such.—Looking
at this more determinately, spirit, in the immediacy of self-consciousness, is                             this
singular self-consciousness, in opposition to the universal self-consciousness; spirit is
exclusive One, which has the still unresolved form of a                           sensory other       for the
consciousness for which           it is there; this consciousness does not as yet know spirit
as its own, or spirit, while it is there as              singular    Self, is not yet equally there as
universal Self, as every Self. Or the shape has not yet the form of the concept, i.e. of the
universal Self, of the Self that in its immediate actuality is equally a sublated Self, is
thinking, universality, without losing its actuality in this universality.—But the
proximate and itself immediate form of this universality is not yet the form                                 of
thinking itself, of the concept as concept, but the universality of actuality, the allness
of the Selves, and the elevation of Being-there into representation; as everywhere, and
to cite a determinate example, the sublated
perception, not yet the universal of the understanding. 1sensory This            is at  first the thing of
    ¶763. This singular man, then, in whose form the absolute essence is revealed,
accomplishes in himself as a singleton the movement of                         sensory Being. He is the
immediately present god; in this way his Being passes over into having-been-ness. The
consciousness, for which he has this sensory presence, ceases to see him, to hear him;
it has seen and heard him; and only in virtue of the fact that it merely has seen and
heard him does it become itself spiritual consciousness, or, as formerly he rose for
consciousness as sensory Being-there, now he has risen in the spirit.—For as the sort
of consciousness that sensorily sees and hears him, it is itself only immediate
consciousness, which has not sublated the disparity of objectivity, has not taken it
back into pure thinking: it knows this objective singleton as spirit, but not itself. In
the vanishing of the immediate Being-there of what is known as absolute essence the
immediate receives its negative moment; spirit remains immediate Self of actuality,
but as the universal self-consciousness of the community, a self-consciousness which
reposes in its own substance, just as in it this substance is universal subject; not the
singleton for himself, but the singleton together with the consciousness of the
community, and what he is for this community, is the complete whole of this spirit.1
    ¶764. But past and distance are only the imperfect form in which the immediate
mode is mediated or posited universally; the immediate mode is dipped only
superficially in the element of thinking, it is preserved in it as                    sensory mode, and
not made one with the nature of thinking itself. It is merely an elevation into
representation, for this is the synthetic combination of sensory immediacy and its
universality or thinking.1
    ¶765. This form, that of representation, constitutes the determinacy in which spirit,
in this its community, becomes conscious of itself. This form is not yet spirit’s self-
consciousness matured to its concept as concept: the mediation is still incomplete.
Thus this combination of Being and thinking contains the defect that the spiritual
essence is still burdened with an unreconciled bifurcation into a Here and a Beyond.
The content is the true content, but all its moments, when posited in the element of
representation, have the character of being uncomprehended, of appearing as com-
pletely independent sides which are related to each other                         externally. If the true
content is to receive also its true form for consciousness, then the higher culture of
---
     (.) 

consciousness is necessary; it must elevate its intuition of the absolute substance into
the concept, and equalize its consciousness with its self-consciousness for itself, just
as this has happened for us or in itself. 1
   ¶766. This content is to be considered in the way in which it is in its consciousness.—
The absolute spirit is content, and is thus in the shape of its truth. But its truth is not only
to be the substance of the community or its in-itself, nor merely to emerge from this
inwardness into the objectivity of representation, but to become an actual Self, to reflect
itself into itself and to be subject. This, then, is the movement which it accomplishes in
its community, or this is the life of the absolute spirit. Consequently, what this self-
revealing spirit is in and for itself, is not elicited by, as it were, unravelling the rich life of
spirit in the community and tracing it back to its first thread, to the representations, say,
of the   first imperfect community, or even to the utterances of the actual man. This
tracing-back is based on the instinct to get to the concept; but it confuses the origin as
the  immediate Being-there of the first appearance with the                     simplicity   of the   concept.
What results from this impoverishment of the life of the spirit, from removing the
representation of the community and its action with regard to its representation, is not
the concept, but rather bare externality and singularity, the historical manner of the
immediate appearance, and the spiritless recollection of a supposed singular shape and
of its past.1
   ¶767. In the      first place, spirit is content of its consciousness in the form of pure
substance, or is content of its pure consciousness. This element of thinking is the
movement of descending into Being-there or into singularity. The middle term
between them is their synthetic combination, the consciousness of becoming-other,
or representation as such.—The third term is the return from representation and
otherness, or the element of self-consciousness itself.—These three moments consti-
tute spirit; its dispersal in the representation consists in its being in a determinate
mode; but this determinacy is nothing other than one of its moments. Its thorough-
going movement is therefore this, to expand its nature in each of its moments as in
an element; since each of these circles completes itself within itself, spirit’s reflection
into itself is at the same time the transition into the other circle.                        Representation
constitutes the middle term between pure thinking and self-consciousness as such,
and is only      one   of the determinacies; but at the same time, as we have seen, its
character of being a synthetic combination is spread over all these elements and is
their common determinacy.1
   ¶768. The content itself which we have to consider has partly occurred already
as the representation of the            unhappy      and the     faithful   consciousness,—but in the
unhappy consciousness, it occurred in the determination of a content                                produced
from   consciousness and         longed for, a content in which spirit cannot be satiated or
find rest, because the content is not yet its content in itself or as its substance; in the
faithful consciousness, on the other hand, the content was regarded as the selfless
essence   of the world, or as essentially              objective   content of representation,—of a
representation that         flees from actuality in general and is therefore without the
certainty of self-consciousness, a certainty that separates from the content partly as
vanity of knowledge, partly as pure insight.—The consciousness of the community,
on the other hand, has the content for its                    substance, just as the content is the
community’s certainty of its own spirit. 1

   ¶769. When spirit is at            first  represented      as substance in the          element of pure
thinking, it is herewith immediately the eternal                  essence, simple and equal to itself,
which does not, however, have this abstract meaning of the essence, but the meaning
of absolute spirit. But spirit is this—not to be meaning, not the inner, but to be the
actual. The simple, eternal essence would therefore be spirit in empty name only, if it
went no further than the representation and the expression of the simple, eternal
essence. But the simple essence, because it is the abstraction, is in fact the negative
in its own self and indeed the negativity of thinking, or negativity as it is in the essence
in itself; i.e. the simple essence is the absolute                 difference    from itself, or its pure
becoming-other. As          essence    it is only     in itself  or for us; but since this purity is
precisely the abstraction or negativity, it is             for itself, or is the     Self, the   concept.—It
is thus    objective; and since representation conceives and expresses the above-
mentioned      necessity    of the concept as a         happening, it will be said that the eternal
essence begets its own other. But in this otherness it has just as immediately returned
into itself; for the difference is the difference in itself; i.e. the difference is immediately
differentiated only from itself, it is thus the unity that has returned into itself.1
   ¶770. There are thus three different moments: that of the essence, that of the Being-
for-itself which is the otherness of essence and for which the essence is, and that of
Being-for-itself or of knowing itself in the other. The essence intuits only its own Self
in its Being-for-itself; in this estrangement of itself it is only at home with itself: the
Being-for-itself that excludes itself from the essence is essence’s knowledge of its own
self; it is the word which, when uttered, estranges him who utters it and leaves him
emptied behind, but which is just as immediately heard, and only this hearing of its
own self is the Being-there of the word. Thus the distinctions that are made are just as
immediately dissolved as they are made, and are just as immediately made as they are
dissolved, and the true and actual is precisely this movement circling within itself.1
   ¶771. This movement within itself proclaims the absolute essence as                              spirit; the
absolute essence that is not grasped as spirit is only the abstract void, just as the spirit
that is not grasped as this movement is only an empty word. If its                             moments       are
grasped in their purity, then they are the restless concepts which are only insofar as
they are in themselves their contrary and have their repose in the whole. But the
community’s representation is not this conceptual thinking; it has the content without
its necessity, and instead of the form of the concept it brings into the realm of pure
consciousness the natural relationships of father and son. Since this consciousness
thus comports itself in a          representational       way even in its thinking, the essence is
indeed revealed to it, but the moments of the essence, owing to this synthetic
representation, partly themselves fall asunder for it, so that they are not related to
one another through their own concept, and partly this consciousness withdraws
from this its pure object, relating to it only externally; the object is revealed to it by an
alien source, and in this thought of the spirit it does not recognize itself, does not
recognize the nature of pure self-consciousness. Insofar as the form of representa-
tion and of those relationships that are derived from the natural must be transcended,
and particularly also the way of taking the moments of the movement, which is spirit,
as isolated unyielding substances or subjects, instead of transient moments—this
transcending is to be regarded as an impulsion of the concept, as we remarked
earlier in the case of another aspect; but since this impulsion is only instinct, it
---
     (.) 

misunderstands itself, rejects the content as well as the form and, what amounts to
the same thing, reduces the content to a historical representation and to an heirloom
of tradition; in this, only the pure externality of faith is retained and so retained as
something dead and non-cognitive; but its interior has vanished, because this would
be the concept that knows itself as concept.1
   ¶772. The absolute spirit, represented in the pure essence, is not indeed the
abstract pure essence; on the contrary, the abstract essence has been reduced to an
element, precisely because it is only a moment in the spirit. But the presentation of
spirit in this element has in itself, with regard to form, the same defect that the essence
as essence has. The essence is the abstract and therefore the negative of its simplicity,
an other; similarly, spirit in the element of essence is the form of simple unity, which is
therefore equally essentially a becoming-other.—Or, what is the same thing, the
relation of the eternal essence to its Being-for-itself is the immediately-simple relation
of pure thinking; in this simple intuition of itself in the other, the otherness is therefore
not posited as such; it is the difference which, in pure thinking, is immediately                             no
difference; a recognition         of the love in which, as regards their essence, the two did
not oppose to each other.—The spirit that is expressed in the element of pure thinking
is itself essentially this: to be not merely in this element, but to be actual spirit, for in
its concept lies
in thought.1          otherness    itself, i.e. the sublation of the pure concept that is only
   ¶773. The element of pure thinking, because it is the abstract element, is itself
rather the other of its simplicity, and therefore passes over into the authentic element
of representation—the element in which the moments of the pure concept obtain a
substantial Being-there in the face of each other, and are also subjects which do not
have for a third party the indifference of Being towards each other but, reflected into
themselves, separate from each other themselves and oppose each other.1
   ¶774. Thus the merely eternal or abstract spirit becomes an other to itself, or enters
into Being-there, and immediately into immediate Being-there. Accordingly, it creates
a world. This creating is representation’s word for the concept                        itself in its absolute
movement or for the fact that the simple declared as absolute, or pure thinking,
because it is the abstract, is rather the negative, and hence what is opposed to itself or
other;—or because, to say the same thing in another form, that which is posited as
essence is simple immediacy or Being, but as immediacy or Being lacks the Self and so,
deficient in inwardness, is passive or Being for another.—This Being for another is at
the same time a world; spirit in the determination of Being for another is the calm
subsistence of the moments formerly enclosed in pure thinking, hence the dissolution
of their simple universality and their divergence into their own particularity.1
   ¶775. However, the world is not only this spirit cast asunder out into the great
whole and its external order, but since spirit is essentially the simple Self, this Self is
equally present in the world: the spirit that is there, which is the singular Self that has
consciousness and distinguishes itself as other, or as world, from itself.—This
singular Self, as it is thus posited at first in an immediate way, is not yet spirit for
itself; so it is not as spirit; it can be called innocent but can hardly be called good. For it
in fact to be Self and spirit, it must first of all become an other to its own self, just as
the eternal essence presents itself as the movement of being equal to itself in its
otherness. Since this spirit is determined as                   first immediately being-there or as
---
                                                                                    .        

dispersed into the multiplicity of its consciousness, its becoming-other is the with-
drawal-into-itself of knowledge in general. Immediate Being-there turns into thought,
or mere sensory consciousness turns into consciousness of the thought; and, moreover,
because it is thought stemming from immediacy or conditioned thought, it is not pure
knowledge, but the thought that has otherness in it and thus the self-opposed thought
of good and evil. Man is represented like this: it                happened as something not neces-
sary,—that he lost the form of equality-with-himself through plucking the fruit of the
tree of the cognition of         good and     evil, and was expelled from the state of innocent
consciousness, from nature offering itself without toil and from paradise, from the
garden of animals.1
    ¶776. Since this withdrawal-into-itself of the consciousness that is there immedi-
ately determines itself as becoming-unequal to itself, Evil appears as the first Being-
there of the consciousness that has withdrawn into itself; and because the thoughts of
Good and Evil are straightforwardly opposed and this opposition is not yet resolved,
this consciousness is essentially only Evil. But at the same time, just because of this
opposition, the good consciousness is also present in the face of it, and so too is their
relationship to each other.—Insofar as the immediate Being-there turns into thought,
and the Being-within-itself          is on the one hand itself a thinking, while on the other
hand the moment of the              becoming-other       of the essence is thereby more precisely
determined by it, the becoming-evil can be transferred further back out of the world
that is there and into the first realm of thinking. It can thus be said that it was already
the   first-born son of light who fell, by withdrawing into himself, but in his place
another was at once produced. Such a form as                     falling, belongs, like son, merely to
representation, not to the concept; they equally distort the moments of the concept,
by reducing them to representation or, conversely, by transferring representation
over into the realm of thought.—Likewise it makes no difference if we assign a
multiplicity of other shapes to the simple thought of otherness in the eternal essence
and transfer the withdrawal-into-itself into them. This assignment must at the same
time be approved, since by means of it this moment of otherness at the same time
expresses diversity, as it should, and indeed not as plurality in general, but at the same
time as determinate diversity, so that the one part, the son, is the simple element that
knows itself as essence, while the other part is the estrangement of Being-for-itself,
which lives only in adoration of the essence; in this part, then, we can place the
recovery of the estranged Being-for-itself and the withdrawal-into-itself of Evil.
Insofar as the otherness divides into two, spirit would be expressed in its moments
more determinately and, if they are counted, expressed as a quartet or, because the
quantity itself again divides into two parts, namely those that have remained good
and those that have become evil, even as a quintet.—But to count the moments can be
reckoned as altogether useless, since on the one hand what is differentiated is itself
only one thing, viz. the thought of the difference, which is only one thought, just as
much as this thought is this differentiation, the second in contrast to the first,—but,
on the other hand, because the thought that encompasses the many in unity must
be dissolved out of its universality and differentiated into more than three or
four distinct components,—and this universality, in contrast to the absolute deter-
minacy of the abstract unit, of the principle of number, appears as indeterminacy
in relation to number itself, so that we could speak only of numbers in general, i.e.
---
      (.) 

not of a specific number of differences. Thus here it is entirely superfluous to think of
number and counting at all, just as in other respects the mere difference of quantity
and amount is unconceptual and insignificant. 1
    ¶777. Good and Evil emerged as the determinate differences of the thought. Since
their opposition has not yet been resolved and they are represented as essences of
thought, each of which is independent for itself, man is the essence-less Self and the
synthetic terrain of their Being-there and conflict. But these universal powers belong
just as much to the Self, or the Self is their actuality. In accordance with this moment,
it therefore happens that, just as Evil is nothing other than the withdrawal-into-itself
of the natural Being-there of spirit, conversely the Good enters into actuality and
appears as a self-consciousness that is there.—That which, in the pure thought of
spirit, is only indicated as the becoming-other of the divine essence in general, here
comes nearer to its realization for representation; this realization consists for repre-
sentation in the self-abasement of the divine essence which renounces its abstraction
and non-actuality.—As for the other aspect, Evil, representation takes it to be a
happening alien to the divine essence; to grasp Evil in the essence itself, as its wrath, is
the highest, hardest effort of representation struggling with itself, an effort which,
since it lacks the concept, remains fruitless.1
    ¶778. The alienation of the divine essence is thus posited in its twofold manner; the
Self of the spirit and its simple thought are the two moments whose absolute unity is
spirit itself; its alienation consists in the fact that the moments separate and one of
them has an unequal value compared with the other. This inequality is therefore the
twofold inequality, and there arise two combinations whose common moments are
those specified. In one of them, the divine essence counts as the essential, while the
natural Being-there and the Self count as the inessential and as what is to be sublated;
in the other, by contrast,            Being-for-itself     counts as the essential and the simple
divinity as the inessential. Their still empty middle term is                     Being-there      in general,
the bare communality of the two moments of the combinations.1
    ¶779. The resolution of this opposition happens not so much through the conflict
between the two moments which are represented as separate and independent
essences. It is involved in their independence that in itself, through its concept, each
of them must dissolve itself within its own self; the conflict first comes to pass where
both cease to be these mixtures of thought and independent Being-there, and where
they confront each other only as thoughts. For then they are, as determinate
concepts, essentially only in the relation of opposition; as independent, by contrast,
they have their essentiality outside of the opposition; their movement is thus their
own free movement. As, then, the movement of the two sides is the movement                                    in
itself, since it is to be considered in the sides themselves, it is initiated by the side that
is determined as that-which-is-in-itself as contrasted with the other. This is repre-
sented as a freely willed doing; but the necessity of its estrangement lies in the
concept, according to which that-which-is-in-itself, which is so determined only in
the opposition, for that very reason does not have genuine subsistence;—so it is the
one for which the Simple, and not Being-for-itself, counts as the essence, that
estranges itself, goes to its death, and thereby reconciles the absolute essence with
itself. For, in this movement, it displays itself as spirit; the abstract essence is alienated
from itself, it has natural Being-there and selfish actuality; this its otherness, or its
---
                                                                                    .           

sensory presence, is taken back by the second becoming-other and posited as
sublated, as      universal; the essence has thereby come to be itself in its sensory
presence; the immediate Being-there of actuality has ceased to be a Being-there
alien and external to it, since that Being-there is sublated, universal; this death is
therefore its arising as spirit.1
    ¶780. The sublated immediate presence of the self-conscious essence is the essence
as universal self-consciousness; this concept of the sublated singular Self, which is
absolute essence, therefore immediately expresses the establishing of a community
which, lingering so far in representation, now returns into itself, as into the Self; and
thus the spirit passes over from the second element of its determination, represen-
tation, into the third, self-consciousness as such.—If we go on to consider how that
representation behaves in its progression,                 first of all we see it expressed that the
divine essence takes on human nature. In this it is already declared that in themselves
the two are not separate;—likewise in the fact that                    from the beginning        the essence
estranges itself, that its Being-there withdraws into itself and becomes evil, it is there
implied, though not declared, that in itself this evil Being-there is not something alien
to the essence; the absolute essence would have only this empty name, if in truth
there were something           other    for it, if there were a        fall from it;—on the contrary,
the moment of Being-within-itself constitutes the essential moment of the Self of the
spirit.—That       Being-within-itself      and, only thereby,        actuality    belong to the essence
itself, this, which is for us the concept and insofar as it is concept, appears to
the representational consciousness as an incomprehensible                         happening; the in-itself
assumes for it the form of indifferent Being. But the thought that those moments that
seem to     flee each other, the absolute essence and the Self that-is-for-itself, are not
separate, also appears to this representation—for it possesses the true content—, but
later,—in the estrangement of the essence that becomes flesh. This representation is
in this way still immediate and therefore not spiritual, or it knows the human shape
of the essence at first only as a particular shape, not yet universal shape; it becomes
spiritual for this consciousness in the movement of the shaped essence, whereby it
sacrifices its immediate Being-there again and returns to the essence: only the essence
as reflected into itself is the spirit.—The reconciliation of the divine essence with the
other   in general, and specifically with the             thought of this other, Evil, is thus repre-
sented in this.—If this reconciliation is expressed in accordance with its concept by
saying that it consists in the fact that Evil is in itself the same thing as the Good, or
again that the divine essence is the same thing as nature in its whole extent, just as
nature separated from the divine essence is only the nothing,—then we must regard
this as an unspiritual mode of expression that must necessarily give rise to misun-
derstandings.—Insofar as Evil is the same thing as the Good, Evil is precisely not Evil,
nor the Good Good, but rather both are sublated, Evil in general the Being-for-itself
that is within-itself; and the Good the selfless Simple. Insofar as both are thus
expressed in terms of their concept, their unity is at once evident; for the Being-
for-itself that is within-itself is simple knowledge, and the selfless Simple is likewise
pure Being-for-itself that is within itself.—Therefore, although it must be said
that, according to this concept of theirs, Good and Evil, i.e. insofar as they are not
Good and Evil, are the same, it must equally be said that they are not the same, but
simply     different, for simple Being-for-itself, or again pure knowledge, are in like

manner pure negativity or the absolute difference within themselves.—Only these
two propositions complete the whole, and the assertion and affirmation of the first
must be confronted by adherence to the other with invincible stubbornness; since
both are equally right, they are both equally wrong, and their wrongness consists in
taking such abstract forms as the same and not the same, identity and non-identity, to
be something true,         fixed, actual, and in relying on them. Neither the one nor the
other has truth, but precisely their movement, in which the simple                              ‘the same’     is
abstraction and hence absolute difference, but this, as difference in itself, differenti-
ated from itself, is therefore equality-to-itself. Precisely this is the case with the
sameness      of the divine essence and of nature in general, and of human nature
in particular; the former is nature insofar as it is not essence; the latter is divine
according to its essence; but it is the spirit in which the two abstract sides are posited
as they are in truth, namely as sublated, a positing that cannot be expressed by the
judgement and the spiritless ‘is’, the copula of the judgement.—Similarly, nature is
nothing apart from its essence; but this nothing itself just as much is; it is the absolute
abstraction, and thus pure thinking or Being-within-itself, and with the moment of
its opposition to the spiritual unity it is                Evil. The difficulty that arises in these
concepts is solely the adherence to the ‘is’ and forgetting the thinking of the concepts
in which the moments just as much are as are not,—are only the movement which is
spirit.—It is this spiritual unity, or the unity in which the differences are present only
as moments or as sublated, that has come to be for the representational consciousness
in this reconciliation; and since this unity is the universality of self-consciousness,
self-consciousness has ceased to be representational; the movement has returned into
self-consciousness.1
    ¶781. Spirit is thus posited in the third element, in universal self-consciousness; it is
its own community. The movement of the community as the movement of the self-
consciousness that differentiates itself from its representation is the movement                              of
bringing to light what has come about in itself. The dead divine man or human god is
in himself      the universal self-consciousness; he has to become this                         for this self-
consciousness. Or, since this self-consciousness constitutes one side of the opposition
of the representation, namely the evil side, for which natural Being-there and the
singular Being-for-itself count as the essence, this side, which is represented as
independent, not yet as a moment, has, because of its independence, to raise itself
in and for itself to spirit, or to present within itself the movement of spirit.1
    ¶782. This side of the opposition is the natural spirit; the Self has to withdraw from
this naturalness and retreat into itself, which would mean to become                            evil. But this
side is already in itself evil; its retreat-into-itself consists, therefore, in convincing itself
that natural Being-there is Evil. The world’s becoming-evil and its being-evil,                               as
being-there, fall within representational consciousness, and so does the reconcili-
ation, as being-there, of the absolute essence; but to self-consciousness as such, what is
thus represented belongs, with regard to form, only as a sublated moment, since the
Self  is the negative; and so it is knowledge,—a knowledge that is a pure activity of
consciousness within itself.—This moment of the                        negative    must likewise express
itself in the content. That is to say, since the essence is already reconciled with itself
in itself and is a spiritual unity in which the parts of representation are sublated or
moments, what presents itself is that each part of the representation here receives the
---
                                                                                    .           

opposite    meaning to what it had before; each meaning thereby completes itself in
the other, and only in this way is the content a spiritual content; since the determin-
acy is just as much its opposite, unity in otherness, the spiritual, is accomplished: just
as for us or in itself the opposite meanings became united previously, and even the
abstract forms of the same and not the same, of identity and                        non-identity     sublated
themselves.1
    ¶783. Thus if in the representational consciousness the becoming-internal                                of
natural self-consciousness was the Being-there of Evil, then in the element of self-
consciousness becoming-internal is the knowledge of Evil as an Evil that is in itself in
Being-there. This knowledge is of course a becoming-of-Evil, but only a becoming of
the thought of Evil, and is therefore recognized as the first moment of reconciliation.
For as a return into itself from the immediacy of nature which is determined as Evil,
it is an abandonment of nature and a dying away to sin. It is not natural Being-there
as such that is abandoned by consciousness, but natural Being-there insofar as it is at
the same time known as Evil. The immediate movement of withdrawal-into-itself is
just as much a mediated movement;—it presupposes itself, or is its own ground; that
is to say, the ground of the withdrawal-into-itself is that in itself nature has already
withdrawn into itself; on account of Evil, man must withdraw into himself; but Evil is
itself the withdrawal-into-itself.—This first movement is for that very reason itself
only the immediate movement, or its simple concept, because it is the same thing as its
ground. The movement or the becoming-other therefore still has to take place in its
more authentic form.1
    ¶784. Besides this immediacy therefore the                   mediation      of the representation is
necessary. In itself the knowledge of nature as the untrue Being-there of spirit, and
this universality of the Self that has come about within itself, is the reconciliation of
the spirit with itself. For the non-conceptualizing self-consciousness this                           in-itself
receives the form of a being and of something represented to it. Thus for it compre-
hension is not a grasping of this concept which knows sublated naturalness as
universal, therefore as reconciled with itself, but rather a grasping of this represen-
tation, according to which through the                    happening      of the divine essence’s own
estrangement, through the happening of its incarnation and death, the essence has
been reconciled with its Being-there.—The grasping of this representation now
expresses more determinately what was previously called, in this representation,
the spiritual resurrection, or the development of its singular self-consciousness into
the universal or into the community.—The                     death    of the divine man, as death, is
abstract negativity, the immediate result of the movement which ends only in natural
universality. Death loses this natural meaning in spiritual self-consciousness, or it
becomes its concept mentioned just now; death is transfigured from what it means
immediately, from the non-Being of this singleton, into the universality of the spirit
that lives in its community, dies and is resurrected in it every day.1
    ¶785. What belongs to the element of                  representation—that absolute spirit as              a
singular spirit, or rather as a particular spirit, represents in its Being-there the nature
of spirit—is thus here transposed into self-consciousness itself, into the knowledge
that preserves itself in its otherness; this self-consciousness therefore does not actually
die, as the particular is       represented as being        actually dead, but its particularity dies
away in its universality, i.e. in its knowledge, which is the essence reconciling itself
---
     (.) 

with itself. The immediately preceding element of representation is thus here posited
as sublated, or it has returned into the Self, into its concept; what was there only a
being has become the subject. By this very fact, the                   first element too, pure thinking
and the eternal spirit in it, is no longer beyond the representational consciousness nor
beyond the Self, but the return of the whole into itself is just this, to contain all
moments within itself. The death of the mediator grasped by the Self is the sublation
of his objectivity or of his particular Being-for-self: this particular Being-for-self has
become universal self-consciousness.—On the other side, the                         universal    has become
self-consciousness just because of this, and the pure or non-actual spirit of mere
thinking has become actual. The death of the mediator is the death not only of his
natural aspect      or of his particular Being-for-self; what dies is not only the already
dead husk removed from the essence, but also the abstraction of the divine essence.
For the mediator, insofar as his death has not yet completed the reconciliation, is the
one-sidedness which knows the simplicity of thinking as the essence                           in contrast to
actuality; this extreme of the Self does not yet have equal value with the essence; the
Self has this only in the spirit. The death of this representation thus contains at the
same time the death of the abstraction of the divine essence which is not posited as
Self. This death is the painful feeling of the unhappy consciousness that God himself
is dead. This hard expression is the expression of the innermost simple self-
knowledge, it is the return of consciousness into the depth of the night of the I =I,
a night that no longer distinguishes or knows anything outside it. Thus this feeling is
in fact the loss of the substance and of its confrontation with consciousness; but it is at
the same time the pure subjectivity of substance, or the pure certainty of itself which it
lacked when it was the object, or the immediate, or pure essence. This knowledge is
thus the    spiritualization, whereby the substance has become subject, by which its
abstraction and lifelessness have died, and by which substance has thus become
actual, and simple and universal self-consciousness. 1
   ¶786. In this way, then, the spirit is spirit knowing itself; it knows itself; that which
is object for it, is, or its representation is the true absolute content; it expresses, as we
saw, the spirit itself. It is at the same time not only content of self-consciousness, and
not only object for it, but it is also actual spirit. It is this because it runs through the
three elements of its nature; this movement through itself constitutes its actuality;—
what is moving is the spirit, it is the subject of the movement, and is equally                              the
moving itself, or the substance that the subject passes through. Just as the concept of
spirit had arisen for us when we entered into religion, namely as the movement of
the self-certain spirit which pardons Evil and in so doing at the same time abandons
its own simplicity and hard unchangeability, or as the movement in which what is
absolutely    opposed     recognizes itself as       the same thing, and this recognition bursts
forth as the     Yes   between these extremes,—this concept is                  intuited    by the religious
consciousness to which the absolute essence is revealed, and this consciousness
sublates the     difference    between its Self and        what it intuits; just as it is the subject,
so also it is the substance, and hence it is itself the spirit, just because and insofar as it
is this movement.1
    ¶787. But this community is not yet perfected in this its self-consciousness; in
general, its content is for it in the form of representation, and the actual spirituality of
the community, its return from its representation, still has this disharmony in it too,
---
                                                                                     .            

just as the element of pure thinking itself was affected with it. The community also
does not have the consciousness of what it is; it is spiritual self-consciousness which is
not an object to itself as this self-consciousness, or which does not open itself up into
consciousness of itself; but rather, insofar as it is consciousness, it has representations
that we have considered.—We see self-consciousness at its last turning-point become
internal to itself and attain to knowledge of its Being-within-itself; we see it estrange its
natural Being-there and acquire pure negativity. But the positive meaning, namely
that this negativity or pure inwardness of knowledge is just as much the essence equal-
to-itself,—or that the substance has here succeeded in becoming absolute self-
consciousness, this is an other for the devotional consciousness. It grasps this aspect,
in which the pure internalization of knowledge is in itself absolute simplicity or the
substance, as the representation of something which is so, not in virtue of the concept,
but as the action of an alien satisfaction. Or it is not for this consciousness that this
depth of the pure Self is the force by which the abstract essence is drawn down from
its abstraction and elevated to the Self by the power of this pure devotion.—The
activity of the Self thereby retains this negative meaning in the face of the devout
consciousness, because the estrangement of substance, for its part, is for this con-
sciousness an in-itself, which it neither grasps nor comprehends, or which it does not
find in its own activity as such.—Since this unity of the essence and the Self has come
about in itself, consciousness too still has this representation of its reconciliation, but
as representation. It obtains satisfaction by externally adding to its pure negativity the
positive meaning of the unity of itself with the essence; its satisfaction thus itself
remains burdened with the opposition of a beyond. Its own reconciliation therefore
enters its consciousness as something distant, as a distance of the future, just as the
reconciliation which the other             Self accomplished appears as a distance of the                   past.
Just as the     singular    divine man has a father who              is-in-himself     and only an        actual
mother, so too the universal divine man, the community, has for its father its own
activity and knowing, but for its mother the eternal love which it only feels, but does
not intuit in its consciousness as an actual, immediate                      object. Its reconciliation is
therefore in its heart, but still split with its consciousness and its actuality still broken.
What enters its consciousness as the                 in-itself  or the side of       pure mediation, is a
reconciliation that lies beyond: but what enters it as present, as the side of immediacy
and Being-there, is the world which has still to await its transfiguration. The world is
indeed reconciled in itself with the essence; and regarding the essence it is known, of
course, that it no longer recognizes the object as alienated from it but as equal to it in
its love. But for self-consciousness this immediate presence does not yet have the
shape-of-spirit. The spirit of the community is thus in its immediate consciousness
separated from its religious consciousness, which declares, it is true, that in them-
selves they are not separated, but an in-itself that has not been realized, or has not yet
become an equally absolute Being-for-itself.1

        (DD.) Absolute Knowledge

        VIII. Absolute Knowledge
¶788. The spirit of revealed religion has not yet overcome its consciousness as such,
or, what amounts to the same thing, its actual self-consciousness is not the object of its
consciousness; the spirit itself in general, and the self-differentiating moments within
it, fall into representation and into the form of objectivity. The                           content    of the
representation is the absolute spirit; and all that still needs to be dealt with is the
sublation of this mere form, or rather, since this form belongs to consciousness as such,
its truth must already have emerged in the configurations of consciousness.—This
overcoming of the object of consciousness is not to be taken as the one-sided process
in which the object shows itself as returning into the Self, but is to be taken in a more
determinate way, thus: the object as such presents itself to the Self as vanishing, but,
more than this, it is the estrangement of self-consciousness that posits thinghood, and
this estrangement has not only a negative but a positive meaning, and has it not only
for us or in itself, but for self-consciousness itself. For self-consciousness the negative of
the object, or its self-sublation, thereby has a positive meaning, or self-consciousness
knows this nullity of the object, on the one hand, because it estranges its own self,—for
in this estrangement it posits itself as object, or, in virtue of the inseparable unity of
Being-for-itself, posits the object as itself. On the other hand, this positing contains
another moment as well, namely, that self-consciousness has equally sublated this
estrangement and objectivity too, and taken it back into itself, so that in its otherness
as such it is at one with itself.—This is the movement of                      consciousness, and in this
movement consciousness is the totality of its moments.—Equally, consciousness must
have entered into relationship with the object in accordance with the totality of its
determinations and have thus grasped it in accordance with each of them. This totality
of its determinations makes the object in itself into the spiritual essence, and it becomes
this in truth for consciousness through the apprehension of each of its singular
determinations as a determination of the Self, or through the aforesaid spiritual
relationship to them.1
    ¶789. Thus the object is first immediate Being, or a thing in general—which corres-
ponds to immediate consciousness; secondly, it is a becoming-other of itself, ts relation-
ship or its      Being for another, and          Being-for-itself, the determinacy—corresponding
to perception,—and thirdly it is essence, or as a universal—corresponding to the under-
standing. The object is, as a whole, the syllogism or the movement of the universal
through determination to singularity, as also the reverse movement from singula-
rity, through singularity as sublated, or determination, and back to the universal.—It
is, therefore, in accordance with these three determinations that consciousness must
---
                                                               .                       

know the object as itself. However, it is not knowledge as pure comprehension of the
object that is in question; this knowledge is to be indicated only in its becoming, or in its
moments on the side that belongs to consciousness as such, and the moments
of the concept proper or of pure knowledge are to be indicated in the form of
configurations of consciousness. For this reason the object does not yet appear in
consciousness as such as the spiritual essentiality we have just affirmed it to be, and
the attitude of consciousness towards it is not the consideration of it in this totality as
such nor in its pure conceptual-form, but is in part a shape of consciousness in general, in
part a number of such shapes which we bring together, and in which the totality of the
moments of the object and of the attitude of consciousness can be indicated only when
resolved into its moments.1
   ¶790. So for this aspect of the apprehension of the object, as it is in the shape of
consciousness, we have only to recall the earlier shapes of consciousness that have
already come up.—Thus, in regard to the object insofar as it is immediate, an
indifferent Being, we saw observing reason                   seek  and    find   itself in this indifferent
thing, i.e. we saw it to be equally conscious of its activity as an external activity, as it is
conscious of the object only as an immediate object.—We also saw observing reason
at its peak express its determination in the infinite judgement that the Being of the I is
a thing.—And in fact a sensory immediate thing: when the I is called                             soul, it is of
course also represented as a thing, but as an invisible, intangible, etc., thing, therefore
in fact not as immediate Being and not as what is meant by a thing.—That judge-
ment, taken as it immediately stands, is spiritless or rather the very absence of spirit.
But in its concept it is in fact the height of spirit, and this interior of the judgement,
which is not yet present in it, is what is expressed in the two other moments to be
considered.1
   ¶791. The thing is I; in fact, in this infinite judgement the thing is sublated; in itself
it is nothing; it has meaning only in the relationship, only                        through the I       and   its
relation   to it.—This moment has emerged for consciousness in pure insight and
enlightenment. Things are simply               useful and to be considered only in their utility.
The   cultivated     self-consciousness which has traversed the world of self-alienated
spirit has, through its estrangement, generated the thing as its own self; therefore,
it still retains its own self in it and knows the dependence of the thing, or it knows
that the thing is essentially only Being for another; or, to give complete expression to
the relationship, i.e. to what alone constitutes the nature of the object here, the thing
counts for it as a being-for-itself, it proclaims sensory certainty as absolute truth, but it
proclaims this very Being-for-itself as a moment that merely vanishes and passes over
into its contrary, into the surrendered Being for another.1
   ¶792. In this, however, knowledge of the thing is still not complete; the thing must
be known not only in the immediacy of its Being and in its determinacy, but also as
essence   or interior, as the Self. This occurs in              moral self-consciousness. Moral self-
consciousness knows its own knowledge as the absolute essentiality, or it knows Being
simply as pure will or knowledge; it is nothing but this will and knowledge; anything
else has only unessential Being, i.e. not Being that is-in-itself, only its empty husk.
Insofar as in its world-representation moral self-consciousness releases Being-there
from the Self, it takes it back again into itself in equal measure. Finally, as conscience,
it is no longer this incessantly alternating placing and shifting of Being-there and of
---
     (.)  

the Self; it knows that its          Being-there     as such is this pure certainty of itself; the
objective element into which it ventures forth when it acts, is nothing other than the
Self ’s pure knowledge of itself. 1
   ¶793. These are the moments of which the reconciliation of spirit with its own
consciousness proper is composed; for themselves they are singular, and it is solely
their spiritual unity that constitutes the force of this reconciliation. The last of these
moments is, however, necessarily this unity itself and, as is evident, in fact it
combines them all in itself. The spirit that, in its Being-there, is certain of itself, has
for the element of Being-there nothing else but this knowledge of itself; the proclam-
ation that it does what it does in accordance with conviction of duty, this language is
the validity of its action.—Action is the first separation, a separation that is-in-itself,
of the simplicity of the concept, and the return out of this separation. This                              first
movement veers round into the second, since the element of recognition posits itself,
as simple knowledge of duty, in the face of the difference and division that lie in action
as such, and in this way it forms an ironclad actuality confronting action. But in
pardon, we saw how this harshness relents and estranges itself. Here, therefore,
actuality, as well as        immediate Being-there,           has for self-consciousness no other
significance than that of being pure knowing;—similarly, as                           determinate      Being-
there, or as relationship, what stands opposed to itself is a knowing, partly of this
purely singular Self, partly of knowledge as universal. In this there is posited at the
same time that the third moment, the universality or essence, counts for each of the
two opposed sides only as             knowledge; and        finally these two sides equally sublate
the empty opposition still remaining and are the knowledge of I= I, this singular Self
that is immediately pure knowledge or universal.1
   ¶794. This reconciliation of consciousness with self-consciousness thus shows
itself as brought about from two sides, once in the religious spirit, and again in
consciousness itself as such. The difference between them is that the former is this
reconciliation in the form of Being-in-itself, the latter in the form of Being-for-itself.
In our consideration of them they at first fall apart; in the order in which the shapes
of consciousness came before us, consciousness arrived at the single moments of
those shapes, and at their unification, long before religion too gave its object the
shape of actual self-consciousness. The unification of the two sides has not yet been
exhibited; it is this that closes the series of the configurations of spirit, for in it spirit
reaches the point of knowing itself, not only as it is                     in itself  or according to its
absolute content, nor only as it is for itself in its form devoid of content or on the side
of self-consciousness, but as it is in and for itself.1
   ¶795. This unification has, however, already happened in itself and that, too, in
religion, in the return of representation into self-consciousness, but not in the proper
form, for the religious side is the side of the                  in-itself  which stands over against
the movement of self-consciousness. Consequently, the unification belongs to this
other side which, by contrast, is the side of reflection into itself, and therefore the
side that contains both itself and its contrary, and not only in itself or in a universal
way, but for itself     or in a developed and differentiated way. The content, as well as
the other side of self-conscious spirit, insofar as it is the other side, has been present
and exhibited in its completeness; the unification that is still lacking is the simple
unity of the concept. The concept, too, is itself already present on the side of
---
                                                               .                        

self-consciousness; but as it has come before us thus far, it has, like all the other
moments, the form of being a particular shape of consciousness.—It is, therefore, that
part of the shape of spirit certain of itself that remains within its concept and was
called the beautiful soul. That is to say, the beautiful soul is its own knowledge of itself
in its pure, transparent unity,—the self-consciousness that knows as spirit this pure
knowledge of pure Being-within-itself,—not only the intuition of the divine, but the
divine’s intuition of itself.—Since this concept remains firmly opposed to its realiza-
tion, it is the one-sided shape which we saw vanish into thin air, but we also saw its
positive estrangement and progression. Through this realization, the self-absorption
of this objectless self-consciousness, the determinacy of the concept in the face of
its fulfilment, sublates itself; its self-consciousness acquires the form of universality,
and what remains to self-consciousness is its genuine concept, or the concept that
has acquired its realization; it is the concept in its truth, that is, in unity with its
estrangement,—the knowledge of pure knowledge, not as the abstract                                essence   that
is duty,—but of knowledge as the essence that is                       this   knowledge,      this  pure self-
consciousness, that is therefore at the same time a genuine object, for the object is the
Self that is-for-itself.1
    ¶796. This concept gained its fulfilment on the one hand in the                          action    of spirit
certain of itself, and on the other, in religion: in religion the concept acquired the
absolute content as content or content in the form of representation, in the form of
otherness for consciousness; in the shape of the acting spirit, by contrast, the form is
the Self itself, for it contains the self-certain spirit in action; the Self accomplishes the
life of absolute spirit. This shape is, as we see, that simple concept which, however,
abandons its eternal essence, is there, or acts. The division or emergence stems from
the   purity   of the concept, for this purity is the absolute abstraction or negativity.
Similarly, the concept has the element of its actuality, or of the Being it contains, in
pure knowledge itself, for this pure knowledge is the simple immediacy that is Being
and Being-there as well as essence, the former, negative thinking, the latter, positive
thinking itself. Finally, this Being-there is just as much the reflectedness into itself
out of pure knowledge—both as Being-there and as duty—or the state of evil. This
withdrawal-into-itself constitutes the                opposition     of the    concept, and is thus the
emergence of the pure knowledge of the essence, a knowing                              without action        and
without actuality. But its emergence in this opposition is participation in it; the pure
knowledge of essence has in itself estranged its simple unity, for it is the division, or
the negativity that the concept is; insofar as this division is the becoming-for-itself, it
is Evil; insofar as it is the         in-itself, it is what remains good.—Now, what at                      first
happens in itself is at the same time for consciousness, and is likewise itself duplicated:
it is both for consciousness          and also its     Being-for-itself     or its own doing. The same
thing that is already posited           in itself now therefore repeats itself as consciousness’s
knowledge of it and as conscious doing. Each party abandons for the other the
independence of the determinacy in which it enters the lists against it. This aban-
donment is the same renunciation of the one-sidedness of the concept that in itself
constituted the beginning; but it is now its own                    renunciation, just as the concept
which it renounces is its own concept.—This                          in-itself   of the beginning is in
truth, as negativity, equally the mediated in-itself, and so it now posits itself as it is
in truth, and the negative is as determinacy                of each for the other and is in itself the

self-sublating in-itself. One of the two parts of the opposition is the disparity between
the Being-within-itself                                         in its             singularity, and the universality,—the other is the
disparity between its abstract universality and the Self. The former dies away to its
Being-for-itself, and estranges itself, makes its confession; the latter renounces the
harshness of its abstract universality, and in so doing dies away to its lifeless Self and
to its unmoved universality; the former has thus completed itself through the
moment of universality that is essence, and the latter through the universality that
is Self. Through this movement of action, spirit—which is only spirit in being there,
in elevating its Being-there into thought                                                                      and thereby into absolute opposition, and
in returning from this opposition through and in this opposition itself,—spirit
has emerged as pure universality of knowing, which is self-consciousness,—as self-
consciousness that is the simple unity of knowing.1
       ¶797. Thus what in religion was content or form of the representation of an other,
this is here the Self ’s own doing; the concept is the bond that makes the content the
Self ’s own doing;—for this concept is, as we see, the knowledge of the Self ’s doing
within itself as knowledge of all essentiality and all Being-there, the knowledge of this
subject as the substance and of the substance as this knowledge of its doing.—What
we have added here is only, on the one hand, the assemblage of the singular moments,
each of which in its principle presents the life of spirit in its entirety, and on the other
hand the firm hold on the concept in the form of the concept, the content of which
had already emerged in these moments and which had already emerged itself in the
form of a shape of consciousness.1
       ¶798. This last shape of spirit—the spirit which at the same time gives its complete
and true content the form of the Self and thereby realizes its concept while remaining
in its concept in this realization—is absolute knowing; it is spirit knowing itself in the
spirit-shape, or conceptual knowing. The truth is not only in itself completely equal to
certainty, but it also has the shape of certainty of itself, or it is in its Being-there, i.e.
for the knowing spirit, in the form of knowledge of itself. The truth is the content,
which in religion is still unequal to its certainty. But this equality consists in the
content’s having received the shape of the Self. As a result, that which is the very
essence, viz. the concept, has become the element of Being-there, or has become the
form of objectivity
element, or what is here the same thing, produced in it by consciousness, is science.1for consciousness. Spirit,               appearing                    to consciousness in this
       ¶799. The nature, moments and movement of this knowing have, then, shown
themselves to be such that this knowing is the pure Being-for-itself of self-consciousness;
it is I, that is this I and no other I, and which is just as immediately mediated or is a
sublated universal I.—It has a content which it differentiates from itself; for it is pure
negativity or self-division; it is consciousness. This content is, in its difference, itself the I,
for the content is the movement of sublating itself, or the same pure negativity that the
I is. In it, as differentiated, the I is reflected into itself; the content is comprehended only in
virtue of the fact that I is together with itself in its otherness. This content, specified more
determinately, is nothing other than the very movement just spoken of; for the content is
the spirit that traverses its own self and does so for itself as spirit by the fact that it has the
shape of the concept in its objectivity.1
       ¶800. But as regards the                                             Being-there of this concept,                                                 science             does not appear in
time and in actuality until spirit has arrived at this consciousness about itself. As the

                                                                .                        

spirit that knows what it is, it does not exist earlier, and nowhere else, than after
completion of the labour of mastering its imperfect configuration, of securing
for its consciousness the shape of its essence, and in this way equalizing its                               self-
consciousness with its consciousness.—The spirit that is in and for itself, differentiated
into its moments, is knowledge that is-for-itself, a comprehension in general that, as
such, has not yet attained the substance or is not in its own self absolute knowledge. 1
   ¶801. Now, in actuality, the knowing substance is there earlier than its form or its
conceptual-shape. For substance is the as yet undeveloped in-itself, or the ground and
concept in its still unmoved simplicity, and therefore the inwardness or the Self of the
spirit, a Self that is not yet there. What is there, is as the still undeveloped simple and
immediate, or as the object of representational consciousness in general. Cognition,
because it is the spiritual consciousness for which what is in itself only is, insofar as
it is Being for the Self, and Being of the Self or concept,—cognition has for this reason
at first only a meagre object, in contrast to which the substance and the consciousness
of this substance are richer. The manifestation which the substance has in this
consciousness is in fact concealment, for substance is still                       selfless Being     and only
the certainty of itself is manifest to itself. At first, therefore, only the abstract moments
of substance belong to          self-consciousness; but since these, as the pure movements,
propel themselves onward, self-consciousness enriches itself until it has wrested from
consciousness the entire substance and has absorbed into itself the entire edifice of the
essentialities of substance, and—since this negative attitude to objectivity is just as much
positive, just as much a positing,—until it has generated them out of itself, and in so
doing has at the same time restored them for consciousness. In the concept that knows
itself as concept, the moments thus enter the scene earlier than the filled whole whose
coming-to-be is the movement of these moments. In consciousness, on the other hand,
the whole, though uncomprehended, is earlier than the moments.1—Time is the concept
itself that   is there, and represents itself to consciousness as empty intuition; for this
reason, spirit necessarily appears in time, and it appears in time just so long as it has not
grasped its pure concept, i.e. has not annulled time. Time is the outer intuited pure Self
which is not grasped by the Self, the merely intuited concept; when this concept grasps
itself it sublates its time-form, comprehends this intuiting, and is a comprehended and
comprehending intuiting.—Time, therefore, appears as the destiny and the necessity of
spirit that is not yet complete within itself,—the necessity to enrich the share which self-
consciousness has in consciousness, to set in motion the immediacy of the in-itself—the
form in which substance is in consciousness,—or conversely, if the in-itself is taken as
the internal, the necessity to realize and reveal what is at first only internal, i.e. to claim it
for certainty of itself.2
   ¶802. For this reason it must be said that nothing is                            known      that is not in
experience, or, to put the same thing in another way, that is not present as                                   felt
truth,   as  the Eternal       inwardly revealed, as a sacred article of                 faith, or whatever
other expressions are used. For experience is just this, that                       in itself the content—
and that is the spirit—is the substance, and therefore an                          object   of  consciousness.
But this substance, which is spirit, is spirit’s becoming what it is in itself; and only as
this becoming that reflects itself into itself is it in itself spirit in truth. Spirit is in itself
the movement which is cognition—the transformation of that in-itself into the for-
itself, of the substance into the subject, of the object of consciousness into an object of
---
          (.)  

self-consciousness, i.e. into an object that is just as much sublated, or into the concept.
This movement is the circle that returns into itself, the circle that presupposes its
beginning and reaches it only at the end.—Hence, insofar as spirit is necessarily this
differentiation within itself, its intuited whole confronts its simple self-consciousness,
and since, then, this whole is what is differentiated, it is differentiated into its intuited
pure concept,                   into time, and into the content or into the                                                       in-itself; the substance
has within it, as subject, the at first inner necessity of presenting itself within itself as
what it is in itself, as spirit. Only when the objective presentation is complete is it at
the same time the reflection of substance or the substance’s becoming a Self.—
Consequently, until spirit has completed itself in itself, until it has completed itself
as world-spirit, it cannot reach its consummation as self-conscious spirit. Therefore,
the content of religion proclaims what spirit is earlier in time than science does; but
only science is spirit’s true knowledge of itself. 1
which spirit accomplishes as actual history. 1 The religious community, insofar as it is
                                                                                        ¶803. The movement of bringing forth the form of its self-knowledge is the labour
at     first the substance of absolute spirit, is the uncultivated consciousness whose
Being-there is all the harsher and more barbarous the deeper its inner spirit is, and
the deeper its spirit is, the harder the labour that its torpid Self has with its essence,
with the alien content of its consciousness. It is only after consciousness has given up
hope of sublating that alienness in an external, i.e. alien, manner that it turns to itself,
because the sublation of that alien mode is the return into self-consciousness; only
then does it turn to its own world and present, discover it as its property, and has
thereby taken the first step towards coming down out of the intellectual world, or
rather towards inspiriting the abstract element of that world with the actual Self.
Through observation it finds, 2                                     on the one hand, Being-there as thought and com-
prehends it, and, conversely, it                                      finds Being-there in its thinking. 3                                       When, to begin
with, this consciousness has thus expressed abstractly the immediate unity of think-
ing and Being, the unity of the abstract essence and the Self, and when it has revived
the first light-essence in a                                purer         way, viz. as unity of extension and Being,—for
extension is a simplicity more like pure thinking than light is,—and has thereby
revived in thought the substance of the Orient, 4 then spirit at once recoils in horror
from this abstract unity, from this
individuality.5 But only after spirit has estranged this individuality in culture, therebyselfless substantiality, and against it affirms
making it into Being-there and establishing it in all Being-there,—only after spirit has
arrived at the thought of utility, and in its absolute freedom has grasped Being-there
as its will, only then does it parade the thought of its inmost depths and enunciate
the essence as I= I.6 But this I =I is the movement which reflects itself into itself; for
since this equality, as absolute negativity, is absolute difference, the self-equality of
the I stands over against this pure difference which, as difference that is pure and at
the same time objective to the self-knowing Self, has to be expressed as time, so that,
just as previously the essence was declared to be the unity of thinking and extension,
it would now have to be grasped as the unity of thinking and time. But the difference
left to itself, unresting and unhalting time, collapses instead within itself; time is the
objective repose of extension, while extension is pure equality with itself, the I. 7—Or
the I is not merely the Self, but the equality of the Self with itself; but this equality is
complete and immediate unity with itself, or this subject is just as much the substance.

The substance, just for itself, would be intuition devoid of content, or the intuition of
a content which, as determinate, would have only accidentality and would lack
necessity; the substance would count as the absolute only insofar as it was thought
or intuited as absolute unity; and all content would, as regards its diversity, have to
fall outside of it into reflection; and reflection does not pertain to substance, because
substance would not be subject, would not be that which reflects on itself and reflects
itself into itself, or would not be comprehended as spirit. If a content were to be
spoken of nevertheless, it would, on the one hand, only be spoken of in order to cast it
into the empty abyss of the absolute, and on the other, it would be a content picked
up externally from sense-perception; knowledge would seem to have come upon
things, upon the difference from itself, and the difference of a variety of things, in a
way and from a source that are beyond comprehension.8
    ¶804. Spirit, however, has shown itself to us to be neither merely the withdrawal
of self-consciousness into its pure inwardness, nor the mere submergence of self-
consciousness into substance, and the non-Being of its difference; but rather                               this
movement       of the Self which estranges itself from itself and submerges itself into
its substance and, as subject, has gone out of that substance into itself, making
the substance into an object and a content, as well as sublating this difference
between objectivity and content. That first reflection out of immediacy is the subject’s
differentiation of itself from its substance, or the self-dividing concept, the withdrawal-
into-itself and becoming of the pure I. Since this difference is the pure doing of the
I=I, the concept is the necessity and the dawning of                        Being-there, which has the
substance for its essence and subsists for itself. But the subsistence of Being-there
for itself is the concept posited in determinacy and thereby also its movement within
itself, that of going down into the simple substance, which is subject only as this
negativity and movement.—The I has neither to cling to itself in the form                              of  self-
consciousness as against the form of substantiality and objectivity, as if it were in
dread of the estrangement of itself;—the force of spirit lies rather in remaining equal
to itself in its estrangement and, as that which is in-itself and for-itself, in positing its
Being-for-itself     merely as a moment, as well as its                Being-in-itself,—nor is the I a
tertium quid that casts the differences back into the abyss of the absolute and declares
their equality therein; on the contrary, knowing consists in this seeming inactivity
which merely considers how what is differentiated moves within itself, and returns
into its unity.1
    ¶805. In knowledge, then, spirit has concluded the movement of giving shape to
itself, insofar as this shaping is burdened with the unsurmounted difference of
consciousness. Spirit has won the pure element of its Being-there, the concept. The
content, in accordance with the freedom of its Being, is the self-estranging Self, or the
immediate unity of self-knowledge. The pure movement of this estrangement, con-
sidered in the content, constitutes the necessity of the content. The diverse content, as
determinate, is in relationship, not in itself, and its restlessness consists in sublating
itself, or it is negativity; therefore, the negativity or diversity, just as it is free Being,
is also the Self; and in this selfish            form   in which the Being-there is immediately
a thought, the content is           concept. So, having won the concept, spirit unfolds the
Being-there and the movement in this aether of its life, and is science. In science,
the moments of spirit’s movement no longer present themselves as determinate

shapes of consciousness, but—since the difference of consciousness has returned into
the Self—as determinate concepts and as the organic movement of these concepts, a
movement grounded in itself. Whereas in the Phenomenology of Spirit each moment
is the difference of knowledge and truth, and is the movement in which that
difference sublates itself, science by contrast does not contain this difference and
the sublation of it; on the contrary, since the moment has the form of the concept, it
unites the objective form of truth and the form of the knowing Self in immediate
unity. The moment does not enter the scene as this movement of passing back and
forth, from consciousness or representation into self-consciousness, and vice versa;
on the contrary, its pure shape, freed from its appearance in consciousness, that is to
say, the pure concept and its onward movement, depends solely on its pure                                deter-
minacy. Conversely, to each abstract moment of science corresponds a shape of
appearing spirit in general. Just as the spirit that is there is not richer than science,
so too it is not poorer in its content either. To cognize the pure concepts of science
in this form of shapes of consciousness constitutes the side of their reality, on which
their essence, the concept, which is posited in them in its                          simple   mediation as
thinking, breaks asunder the moments of this mediation and presents itself in
accordance with the inner opposition.1
    ¶806. Science contains within itself this necessity of estranging from itself the form
of the pure concept, and it contains the passage of the concept into consciousness. For
the self-knowing spirit, just because it grasps its concept, is the immediate equality
with itself which, in its difference, is the certainty of the immediate, or is                         sensory
consciousness,—the beginning from which we set out; this release of itself from the
form of its Self is the supreme freedom and the assurance of its knowledge of itself.1
    ¶807. Yet this estrangement is still incomplete; it expresses the relation of its self-
certainty to the object, an object which, just because it is thus related, has not yet won
its complete freedom. Knowledge is aware not only of itself but also of the negative of
itself, or its limit. To know one’s limit is to know how to sacrifice oneself. This
sacrifice is the estrangement in which spirit displays its becoming spirit in the form
of free contingent happening, intuiting its pure Self as time outside of it, and equally
its  Being   as space. This latter becoming of spirit,                nature, is its living immediate
becoming; nature, the estranged spirit, is in its Being-there nothing but this eternal
estrangement of its subsistence and the movement which establishes the subject. 1
    ¶808. But the other side of spirit’s becoming, history, is a knowing, self-mediating
becoming—spirit estranged into time; but this estrangement is equally an estrange-
ment of itself; the negative is the negative of itself. This becoming presents a slow
movement and succession of spirits, a gallery of images, each of which, endowed with
all the riches of spirit, moves so slowly just because the Self has to penetrate and digest
this entire wealth of its substance. As the fulfilment of spirit consists in perfectly
knowing what it is, in knowing its substance, this knowing is its withdrawal-into-itself
in which it abandons its Being-there and hands its shape over to recollection. In its
withdrawal-into-itself spirit is sunk in the night of its self-consciousness, but in that
night its vanished Being-there is preserved; and this sublated Being-there—the
former one, but now reborn of knowledge—is the new Being-there, a new world
and a new shape of spirit. In this new shape the spirit has to make a new beginning
with its immediacy, as naively as before, and expand to maturity again, as if, for it, all

that preceded were lost and it had learned nothing from the experience of the earlier
spirits. But re-collection has preserved them and is the interior and in fact the higher
form of the substance. So although this spirit begins its cultivation afresh, seeming to
set out only from itself, it is nonetheless at a higher stage that it begins. The realm of
spirits which has formed itself in this way in Being-there constitutes a succession in
which one spirit superseded another and each took over the realm of the world from
its predecessor. The goal of this succession is the revelation of the depth, and this
is the absolute concept; this revelation is thereby the sublation of the depth of the
concept, or the        expansion      of it, the negativity of this I withdrawn-into-itself, a
negativity which is its estrangement or substance,—and this revelation is also the
time of the concept, the time in which this estrangement estranges itself within itself,
and so in its expansion it is equally in its depth, in the Self.                        The goal, absolute
knowledge, or spirit that knows itself as spirit, has for its path the recollection of the
spirits as they are within themselves and as they accomplish the organization of their
realm. Their preservation, on the side of their free Being-there appearing in the form
of contingency, is history, while on the side of their conceptually comprehended
organization, it is the        science    of  appearing knowledge; the two together, compre-
hended history, form the recollection and the calvary of absolute spirit, the actuality,
truth, and certainty of its throne, without which it would be lifeless solitude; only—
                                from the chalice of this realm of spirits
                                foams forth for Him his own infinitude. 1

Glossary of Some Key Terms
Action: Handlung, Handeln. Doing(s): Tun. Deed: Tat. Handlung is ‘a conscious expression of
     the will. It is only possible in statements which describe, judge or by implication draw
     attention to the motives of “acts” or “actions” ’ (Farrell, 1977, p.3). Handeln is ‘ “action” as
     opposed to inactivity, thought, words’ (ibid., p.6).               Tun, the nominalization of the verb tun
     (‘do’), is  ‘used in the sense of the general conduct, actions, or doings of an individual. It is
     vaguer than the other terms’           (ibid.). I usually translate Tun          as ‘doing(s)’, but occasionally
     resort to ‘activity’, ‘operation’, etc. Tat ‘refers to the completed act or action, the result,
     which is seen plastically and as a whole’ (ibid., p.4.).
Actual(ity): wirklich,        Wirklichkeit. Real, reality:         real, reell, Realität. For Hegel, wirklich is a
     more weighty term than real or reell. Everything actual is real, but not everything real is
     actual. Wirklich ‘means “existing in actuality and effect” as opposed to something which
     exists in name or in mere possibility’           (Farrell, 1977, p.271). It is thus similar to wahr,             ‘true’,
     in the sense of ‘ “corresponding to the prototype” and “conforming with the real idea of the
     thing as it should be”, opposed to the false and apparent’ (ibid.). In PS ¶47 ‘the actual’ (das
     Wirkliche) is equated with the           ‘Being-there’     of a concept. Thus, e.g., an acorn is not actual,
     since although it involves the concept of an oak-tree, the concept is not yet realized, but
     merely potential. Equally, a deformed or stunted tree is not actual, since it is not an adequate
     realization of the concept. A stray piece of wood or speck of dust is not actual, even though it
     is is there, since it does not realize anything that Hegel would recognize as a concept.
Alienate, alienation: entfremden, Entfremdung. Estrange, estrangement: (sich) entäussern,
     Entäusserung. These are near synonyms, and are used synonymously in, e.g., ¶488. But they
     are not exact synonyms. To alienate something is to make it strange or alien. Thus in
     alienation something becomes a stranger to itself. To estrange something is simply to part
     with it or dispose of it. It might also be translated as ‘externalize, exteriorize’, and sometimes it
     is the counterpart of (sich)        erinnern, Erinnerung,        ‘recollect(ion), internaliz-e, -ation.’
Appear, appearance: erscheinen,               Erscheinung. These words, like their English counterparts,
     have two main senses: (1) ‘emerge, come into view, become manifest’, where there is no
     contrast with reality; (2) ‘seem, look (as if )’, where something may appear to be other than
     it really is. Erscheinung can sometimes be translated as ‘phenomenon’, which, like the word
     ‘Phenomenology’, comes from the Greek word for ‘appear’, phainomai, which has the same
     ambiguity.
Being: (das) Sein. The infinitive of the verb ‘to be’ is sein. Hegel often uses it as a noun and then
     it is capitalized as Sein. I have retained the capital in order to distinguish it from the present
     participle, seiend, especially when it is nominalized as das Seiende,                     ‘the being’,    ‘beings’, or
     ‘that which is’, as in ¶53. A special problem is the use of the participle                             seiend    as an
     attributive adjective, as in das seiende Wesen                 (¶718), where English does not allow                 ‘the
     being essence’ and seiende cannot be translated as ‘existing’, since Sein, in Hegel’s usage,
     indicates the bare minimum of reality and is quite distinct from Existenz and from Dasein,
     ‘Being-there’. In ¶718 I resort to a paraphrase, ‘the essence that simply is’, and I adopt
     similar devices elsewhere.
Being-there: Dasein. This word was coined, from da (‘there’) and sein (‘being, to be’), as a
     Germanic alternative to the Latinate Existenz. Heidegger used it to mean roughly ‘human
     being’ and ‘being human’, and also stressed its derivation from da and sein. Hegel does not
     use it in Heidegger’s way, but he nevertheless differentiates it from Sein and Existenz, which
---
          

    in Hegel (as in Heidegger) retains the flavour of its Latin ancestor, exsistere, ‘step forth,
    arise, emerge’. In Hegel, Dasein might also be translated as                     ‘determinate Being’ or, some-
    times, as    ‘embodiment’. In ¶47 it is the embodiment or realization of a                        Begriff,  ‘concept’,
    and the combination of a concept and its Dasein is das Wirkliche,                        ‘the actual’. But in ¶187
    the  Dasein from which self-consciousness displays its detachment does not correspond to
    any particular concept. Hegel also uses dasein as a verb, especially its present participle as
    an attributive adjective, and also the combination da ist, ‘is there’. The latter gives some
    licence for my hyphenated rendering.
Comprehend, conceptual(ize):              begreifen. This verb has the same ambiguity as ‘comprehend’,
    meaning both ‘understand’ and ‘include’, but is also associated with Begriff, ‘concept’. It
    denotes what is, for Hegel, the highest level of thought, grasping things in terms of pure
    concepts. It contrasts, in particular, with Vorstellung, pictorial ‘representation’. Whereas
    Vorstellung tends to separate things, Begreifen brings them together as interacting activities
    or processes, and hence combines inclusion with abstraction.
Concept: Begriff. A concept, for Hegel, is abstract and non-empirical. Thus, e.g., Being is a
    concept, but redness is not. Nevertheless, it is useful to consider a concept in terms of
    Hegel’s botanical analogy. A concept is comparable to the plan or programme embodied in
    a seed. Thus the concept of something is often just the undeveloped beginning of it, as in
    ¶78. But this concept generates and controls the subsequent growth of the plant. Hence the
    concept is not simply our way of looking at things, but is an active force within them, a
    ‘subject’. When the plant is fully grown, its concept is fulfilled. Hence the concept of
    something is often its fully developed state. A concept is an active process, interconnecting
    and embracing different stages of a plant’s growth. Hegel’s concepts are similarly intercon-
    nected, moving from one to the other. Hence concepts form one overall concept,                                       the
    concept. Cf. the category in ¶235.
Conscious, consciousness: bewusst, Bewusstsein. In Hegel’s usage to be conscious is not simply to
    be awake and vaguely aware of one’s surroundings, but to have a reflective conception of objects
    conceived as distinct from oneself. Hence he does not attribute consciousness to animals, or to
    logicians. The logician is thinking about thoughts that are not distinct from himself.
Desire: Begierde. This ‘refers only to strongly emotional desires and is thus more restricted in
    application than “desire”.         Begierde concentrates attention on the subject’. The correspond-
    ing adjective, begierig, means ‘desirous of getting possession of something which satisfies an
    appetite or insistent desire, for oneself, not for others. It rarely refers to the desires of the
    higher self, although an intellectual interest may be involved’                         (Farrell, 1977, p.18). In
    ¶¶167ff., it is restricted to desire for living entities that are not self-conscious. Its connection
    with self-consciousness depends on its being a desire to eliminate things other than oneself
    and also to get them, i.e. consume them, oneself. A desire is essentially self-interested: a
    desire for X is a desire that I should get X. In desire the Self is thus more salient than in the
    theoretical shapes of chapters I–III.
Determine, determination, determinacy: bestimmen, Bestimmung, Bestimmtheit. Bestimmung
    has two broad senses. First, it is ‘determination’ in such senses as ‘delimitation, definition’;
    adding features to a thing or a concept; or the features so added. Secondly, it may refer not
    to the present condition of something, but to its ‘destination, destiny, vocation, calling’. (It
    never means        ‘determination’       in the sense of        ‘resoluteness’     or  ‘fixity of purpose’.)       Bes-
    timmtheit is less dynamic and denotes the state resulting from a process of Bestimmung.
Devotion: Andacht. Not thought, but on the way to thought, as its derivation from denken
    suggests. See ¶¶217, 571, and 711.
Element:     Element. Hegel generally uses this word in the sense of                          ‘surroundings, habitat,
    environment’, not in the sense of a component or a chemical element, though he sometimes
    has in mind the four ancient Greek elements: earth, air, fire, and water.

                                                                                                 

Equal(ity) (like(ness)):        gleich,  Gleichheit. Unequal (unlike), inequality (unlikeness): ungleich,
     Ungleichheit. Hegel sometimes uses these words in ordinary ways. In ¶1, e.g., Ungleichheit is
     simply ‘incongruity’. However, he often uses them reflexively to indicate that something is
     equal to, or unequal to, itself, i.e. in harmony or disharmony with itself. See e.g. ‘equality-to-
     itself ’ (Sichselbstgleichheit) in ¶21. This usage seems to be influenced by the polarity of the
     magnet: see ¶¶156ff.
In itself:  an sich. For itself, for self: für sich. These expressions, often together with Sein, as in
     e.g. ‘Being-for-itself ’, are usually contrasted with each other. They express three ideas,                       first
     that of mere potentiality (an sich) in contrast to actuality ( für sich), secondly that of self-
     awareness or self-consciousness ( für sich) in contrast to unawares (an sich) (as in ¶186),
     and thirdly that of separation ( für sich) from its context (the in-itself or what is an sich). In
     the latter sense für sich might often be translated as ‘by itself ’ or                 ‘on its own’: e.g. in ¶130
     ‘Being-for-itself ’ amounts to Being by itself, independence. I sometimes translate ‘Für-sich-
     sein’  as  ‘Being-for-self ’     instead of     ‘Being-for-itself ’, especially when the gender of the
     reflexive pronoun is indeterminate.
Infinite, infinity: unendlich, Unendlichkeit. In later works, e.g.                  Enc. I, ¶¶94f., Hegel explicitly
     distinguishes between true or good infinity and spurious or bad infinity. True infinity
     differs from bad infinity in two respects: first, bad infinity excludes and contrasts with the
     finite and is bounded by the finite and therefore not really infinite or ‘unbounded’, while
     true infinity embraces the finite. Secondly, bad infinity proceeds in a straight line in an
     endless progression or regress, while true infinity is self-enclosed and comparable to a circle
     rather than a straight line. It is, we might say,                  finite but unbounded. Hegel does not
     explicitly draw this distinction in PS, but he tacitly operates with true, rather than bad,
     infinity: see e.g. the final sentence of ¶161. The infinite is therefore akin to the absolute,
     which must also be all-embracing and include its finite manifestations.
Intuit, intuition:      anschauen, Anschauung. It is immediate awareness, usually sensory, as in
     ¶104, but sometimes amounts to ‘behold’, or ‘view’, as in ‘world-view’, Weltanschauung,
     ¶599. It does not have the flavour of instinctive knowledge or belief, as the English words
     do.
Invert, inversion:       verkehren,     Verkehrung. Also translated as ‘reverse, reversal’                 and ‘pervert,
     perversion’     or   ‘conversion’, as in ¶391. Science is the inversion of                       ‘immediate self-
     consciousnss’: ¶26. The inversion of something into its opposite begins in earnest with
     the inverted world of ¶157, but it is a persistent theme throughout the Phenomenology. The
     passing of any shape of consciousness involves a reversal of sorts, since what it takes to be
     true turns out otherwise. But see especially ¶171 on life, ¶230 on the unhappy conscious-
     ness, ¶306 on the individual and his environment, ¶¶312 and 322 on the perversion of one’s
     words and actions by others, ¶340 on the inversion of what is wholly bad into something
     good, and also ¶¶364f., 376, 467, 497ff. (the good and bad switch sides), 521ff. (the
     inversion of good and bad in the inverted world of Rameau’s nephew), 738 (reversal in
     tragedy), and 782.
Immediate:        unmittelbar;      mediate,     mediation:       vermitteln,     Vermittlung. Both things and
     thoughts may be mediated. Things are mediated causally, whereas thoughts are mediated
     epistemically and/or logically. An oak tree and an acorn are mediated causally, the tree by
     the acorn from which it grew, the acorn by the tree on which it grew. By contrast, my belief
     in, say, God may be either immediate—depending on no proof or evidence—or mediated
     by proofs or evidence. The immediacy and mediation here are epistemic or logical, since an
     epistemically     immediate belief can hardly be                causally    unmediated. As with all sharp
     distinctions, Hegel sublates the distinction between causal and logico-epistemic mediation.
     He does so, because in his view reason and concepts are immanent in things, and the
     relations and development of things are the actualization of their logical content. He

    systematically transposes logical forms, notably the mediating syllogism, into the world.
    Nothing, in Hegel’s view, is purely immediate or purely mediated. Logical mediation does
    not, as it does in traditional logic, relate items whose content is fixed independently of their
    mediation. Hence, an ‘immediate’              belief in God owes such content as it has to its residual
    mediation; but its content remains thin and indeterminate without mediating proofs.
    Conversely, the determinate content that something has acquired from mediation can be
    considered in its concrete immediacy: I can contemplate an oak tree without thinking of the
    acorn. See PS ¶¶21f., 189, 597.
Know, -ing, -ledge:          wissen,    Wissen.    Cognize, cognizing, cognition:               erkennen,      Erkennen,
    Erkenntnis. The most general term for ‘know’ is wissen, while erkennen and its cognates
    are more weighty terms, applied to philosophical and scientific knowledge. In accordance
    with its derivation from a defunct verb for ‘see’, Wissen tends to be immediate, whereas
    Erkennen is based on reasoning and involves a process of getting to know something.
    However, W.A. Suchting, in Enc. I, pp.xl–xlii, argues that Hegel uses wissen                         in a lower and
    a higher sense. In the lower sense Wissen is simply immediate, while in the higher sense, it is
    mediated, but its mediation has been ‘sublated’ or overcome. Erkennen lies between the two,
    still burdened with mediation and still only on the way to ultimate truth. Hence chapter VIII
    can be entitled Das absolute Wissen, a bird’s-eye view of the truth that has left its mediation
    behind. Wissen is a close relative of Bewusstsein, ‘consciousness’, and of gewiss(heit),
    ‘certain(ty)’, but distinct from both. In Hegel’s usage certainty is subjective and may be at odds
    with the truth: see ¶798 and note. Wissen aims at truth, but this does not entail its truth in the
    ordinary sense, or in Hegel’s sense(s): see ¶¶39, 76, and 83. This coheres with Hegel’s view
    that truth and falsity are not sharply distinct from each other: see ¶¶38f. There is a further
    ambiguity in Wissen when it is used as a noun. Like the word ‘knowledge’, it may refer either
    to what is known (as in ‘His knowledge is inexhaustible’) or to the knowing of it (as in ‘He did
    it without my knowledge’): see ¶85.
Mean, meaning: meinen, Meinen, Meinung. The verb meinen has two senses: ‘believe, opine’
    and ‘intend, mean to say’. Meinung usually means ‘opinion’, but Hegel also gives it the sense
    of ‘meaning’. Here        ‘mean’ and ‘meaning’         are quite different from ‘mean’ and ‘meaning’ in
    the sense of ‘signify’ (bedeuten) and ‘signification, significance’ (Bedeutung). I sometimes
    translate meinen-words as ‘opine, opining, opinion’ when Hegel’s word-play requires it. See
    ¶¶63, 97–110, esp. 100, 297, 319, and 424.
Moment: Moment. A ‘moment’ is a moving force or impetus. In SL, p.82, Hegel illustrates this
    with the lever, a rigid bar rotating about a fixed point, a fulcrum or pivot. In lifting a weight
    on one end of the lever, there are two relevant factors or ‘moments’: the force applied to the
    other end of the lever, and the distance between the application of this force and the
    fulcrum. If either of these is decreased, then the other needs to be proportionately
    increased. Either alone is ineffectual. This explains why moments taken separately are
    ‘static’: see PS ¶32. Hegel uses this idea widely. In logic, for example, pure being and pure
    nothing are moments of becoming: becoming would not occur if there were only pure
    being or only pure nothing. In particular, it applies to the shapes of consciousness in
    PS. A shape collapses because it consists of different moments that enter into conflict with
    each other.
Morality: Moralität; Ethical life, order, etc.: Sittlichkeit. Hegel’s distinction between these is
    comparable, though not identical with, with Bertrand Russell’s distinction between ‘positive
    morality’, a ‘social institution analogous to law’ (Sittlichkeit), and ‘personal morality’, which
    is a ‘matter for the individual conscience’ (Moralität) in Russell (2004), p.186, and also to the
    distinction drawn by Strawson (1961) between ‘social morality’ and ‘individual ideal’. Sittlich
    and   Sittlichkeit   come from Sitte,        ‘custom’, and for Hegel have the              flavour of    ‘customary
    morality’. He associates        Sittlichkeit  especially with the ancient Greeks, who, he said, ‘had no
---
                                                                                                 

     conscience’, and Moralität with Kant and his successors, but a modern society must accom-
     modate both.
Object, objective, objectivity: Gegenstand, gegenständlich, Gegenständlichkeit                        (Objekt,    objektiv,
     Objektivität). Hegel uses Objekt, etc. only in the Preface and once in the Introduction, and
     always in explicit contrast to Subjekt, subjektiv or              Subjektivität. Objekt is a technical logical
     term, while Gegenstand is an everyday term, sometimes amounting to ‘subject-matter’, ‘topic’,
     or even ‘subject’, as in the first sentence of ¶1. But usually a Gegenstand is an intentional object
     of Bewusstsein     (consciousness), as its etymology (‘standing against’) suggests.
Reason: Vernunft;         understanding:        Verstand; reason(s),         ground(s): Grund, Gründe. Under-
     standing and reason (Vernunft) are different ways of thinking. Understanding sets up clear-
     cut and stable distinctions between things and between concepts, between e.g. truth and
     falsity (see ¶39), while reason, in its negatively rational form, shows how the distinction
     breaks down, and, in its ‘speculative’ or positively rational form, displays the emergence of a
     unity that     ‘sublates’    the understanding’s initial distinction. See esp.                  Enc. I, ¶¶79–82.
     ‘Reason’ as Vernunft is quite different from ‘reason’ as Grund. Vernunft is the reason or
     rationality immanent in concepts or things, and only needs to be brought to light by the
     philosopher. A Grund, in one of its several senses, is a reason, or one’s reason, for doing or
     believing something, and may be quite extraneous to what is done or believed. Moreover,
     appeal to reasons, or Räsonnement, is generally inconclusive: there are, in Hegel’s view,
     reasons for, and reasons against, doing or believing almost anything. See PS ¶¶48, 58ff. In
     view of this, the connection sometimes drawn between Hegel’s                             Vernunft      and Wilfred
     Sellars’s conception of the        ‘space of reasons’      is problematic.
Recognize: anerkennen. This might more appropriately be translated as ‘acknowledge’, whose
     meaning overlaps that of ‘recognize’, but does not coincide with it, since acknowledgement
     is invariably overt, whereas recognition need not be: one can recognize a person or one’s
     mistake without acknowledging him or it.
Recollect(ion), internaliz-e, -ation: (sich) erinnern, Erinnerung. In ordinary German, erinnern
     means     ‘remind’, and the reflexive,          sich erinnern,      ‘remind oneself, remember, recollect’.
     However, Hegel often uses the verb in accordance with what he takes to be its root meaning,
     ‘to internalize, interiorize’, often combining this with its standard meaning. So e.g. in ¶47
     the reflexive sich erinnert       means not simply ‘recollects, remembers’, but ‘recollects/intern-
     alizes  itself ’. Especially in ¶¶753 and 808              Erinnerung      is the converse of        Entäusserung,
     estrangement, externalization’. It is tempting to hyphenate the words as ‘re-collect(ion)’.
     But this is excluded by the fact that while in ¶¶753 and 808 Hegel writes Er-innerung to
     emphasize its novel sense, he usually leaves the word unhyphenated.
Relation: Beziehung. Relationship: Verhältnis. ‘Verhältnis means primarily “ratio” and                               “pro-
     portion”. Applied to a “relation” between things, it can only mean that they stand in a
     certain ratio to each other, i.e. that the relation is fixed in this way. It is not used in a general
     way to indicate a vague connection. . . . Beziehung                  is a relationship in which one thing
     influences the other, or where there is interaction, therefore often in reference to two events’
     (Farrell, 1977, p.278).
Represent; representation, idea: vorstellen, Vorstellung. Idea: Idee. A Vorstellung is a                          ‘mental
     picture of a thing. It draws attention less to the thing in its objective aspects than to the state
     of mind of the subject, particularly with regard to the intensity, vividness, clarity, persist-
     ence or otherwise of the image’            (Farrell, 1977, p.156). Moreover, in Hegel’s view,                Vorstel-
     lung   tends to separate things, while            Begreifen brings them together in a comprehensive
     movement. In ordinary German Idee is often used, like Vorstellung, for an idea in the mind,
     but Hegel normally uses it for an objective ‘Idea’ in something like Plato’s sense: see e.g.
     ¶55. (Contrast      ‘Plato had some bright ideas [Vorstellungen]’                  with ‘Plato worshipped the
     Idea [Idee] of the Good’.) However, Hegel differs from Plato in regarding an Idea not
---
          

     simply as a concept, but as a concept realized, together, that is, with its Being-there or
     objectivity. But this becomes explicit only in later works: see e.g. Enc. I, ¶213. In PS ¶47,
     the combination of a concept and its Being-there is equated with ‘the actual’, not with the
     Idea. The contrast between              Vorstellung      and    Idee   gives rise to two different senses of
     ‘idealism’. Kant and Schopenhauer are Vorstellung-idealists, while Hegel is an                            Idee-idealist.
     I translate    Vorstellung      as ‘representation’, especially when it contrasts with                        ‘concept’,
     ‘thought’, etc., but occasionally as             ‘idea’, when it is used informally. I capitalize                  ‘Idea’
     when it renders        Idee.
Singular, singleton, singularity: einzeln, (der) Einzelne,                   Einzelheit. Individual         (adj.), individ-
     ual, individuality:      individuell, (das)      Individuum, Individualität. These groups of words are
     near-synonyms, but they are not exact synonyms. Individuell, etc. are more weighty terms
     than   einzeln, etc. Einzeln      ‘translates “separate(ly)”        in reference to the individual parts of a
     whole or a group’ (Farrell, 1977, p.296) and                  ‘means    “individual”, i.e. taken separately, by
     itself, in relation to the parts of a whole or to a number’ (ibid., p.315), while der Einzelne is
     ‘the general term for “the individual”. Das Individuum is used in more strictly philosophical
     contexts, and not like English              “individual” in the sense of             “person” ’    (ibid., p.297). By
     contrast,    individuell, etc. cannot be applied to the parts of a whole, only to a complete
     whole: see e.g. ¶266, where a whole organism is an ‘individual’, while its parts are ‘singular’.
     The three moments of the concept in Hegel (see                        Enc. I, ¶¶163ff.) are the universal (i.e.
     generic), the particular (i.e. specific), and the individual or singular. But here ‘individual’ is
     Einzelne. It cannot be Individuelle, since in PS ¶28, and often elsewhere, Hegel speaks of das
     allgemeine Individuum            (‘the universal individual’), where             das allgemeine Einzelne would
     make no sense. Individualität does not contrast with universality and particularity, but may
     embrace them. When Hegel, in his lectures on history, speaks of the                                  ‘world-historical
     individual’ (such as Alexander, Caesar, and Napoleon), this must be an Individuum, not an
     Einzelner.
Self: (das) Selbst. I: (das)       Ich. ‘The Self ’ is das Selbst, the nominalization of the pronoun selbst,
     which means ‘itself, myself ’, etc., used for emphasis, as in ‘I did it myself ’. It is distinct from
     the reflexive pronoun, sich, etc., though it is often used to strengthen the reflexive pronoun,
     sich selbst, ‘its, one’s, etc. own self ’. (Thus, e.g., ‘for itself ’ is für sich, and often für sich selbst,
     but never für selbst, and ‘relate itself to itself ’ is sich auf sich beziehen.) As pronouns, ‘self ’,
     selbst, and sich can apply to almost any entity: ‘The city itself is beautiful, but the people are
     not’, ‘It shows itself at its best in the winter’, and so on. Moreover, nouns with the reflexive
     prefix ‘self ’, or selbst, such as ‘self-preservation’ (Selbsterhaltung), also apply to a wide range
     of entities. But as free-standing nouns, ‘Self ’ and Selbst are closely related to ‘the I’ and are
     restricted to humans or more generally to spiritual things. I have capitalized                             ‘Self ’ when
     Hegel uses (das) Selbst        as a noun.
Selfish, selfless: selbstisch, selbstlos.        Selbstisch, like ‘selfish’, ordinarily means             ‘egotistical, con-
     cerned with one’s own desires and interests, regardless of others’. But Hegel reverts to its
     literal meaning of ‘pertaining to the Self, oneself ’                or  ‘self-like’. Correspondingly, selbstlos
     normally means         ‘self-effacing, self-sacrificing’, but Hegel uses it in the sense of                     ‘lacking,
     devoid of, a Self ’, as in ¶602, where nature is              ‘selfless’. Hegel likes to use words in a literal
     sense without the accretions that they acquire in informal discourse. I have followed him in
     my translation in order to preserve his tendency to use words in unusual, literal, ways.
Self-essence: Selbstwesen. This often contrasts with                   Gemeinwesen,        ‘commonwealth’, but liter-
     ally ‘common-essence’. See ¶¶249, 447, 472, and 477.
Speculation, speculative: Spekulation, spekulativ. These words derive from the Latin speculari,
     ‘to spy out, examine, explore’. In philosophy they originally referred to theoretical philoso-
     phy in contrast to practical philosophy. But Hegel appropriates them to characterize to his
     own dialectical method, especially the third, ‘positively rational’, stage of it, where the ‘fixed
---
                                                                                                  

     determinacies’ set up by the analytical understanding (Enc. I, ¶80), which have been broken
     down by the dialectical, or negative, reason (Enc. I, ¶81), are restored in a satisfying unity-
     in-difference (Enc. I, ¶82). The words occur frequently in the Preface, but rarely in the rest
     of PS, since they are associated primarily with Hegel’s logic. The Latin verb also gave rise to
     speculum, ‘mirror’, and Hegel’s usage is often said to involve mirroring: see e.g. Enc. I, ¶82,
     n.41. But speculum        is only a minor member of the              specul-family, and there is no trace in
     Hegel of a link between ‘speculation’ and mirrors. Enc. I, ¶112 Addition associates mirrors
     with ‘reflection’ rather than speculation.
Spirit: Geist. In Enc. III, Hegel explicitly distinguishes three stages of spirit:                     ‘subjective spirit’
     (roughly, the individual mind), ‘objective spirit’               (the collective social life of a people), and
     ‘absolute spirit’    (art, religion, and philosophy). He does not draw this distinction explicitly
     in PS, and tends to call the individual mind the ‘soul’ (Seele) rather than the ‘spirit’: see ¶77.
     Geist’s wide range of senses (including the ‘holy spirit’) and its tendency develop from one
     to the other, as well as its tendency to embrace what is other than Geist, make it an
     especially suitable candidate for the status of the absolute.
State: Staat. I capitalize ‘State’ in the political sense in order to distinguish it from ‘state’ in the
     sense of    ‘condition’     (Zustand), as in ¶477, where              ‘state of right’     is Rechtszustand, not
     Rechtsstaat.
Sublate, sublation: aufheben, Aufhebung. Aufheben has three distinct senses: ‘to pick up, raise’,
     ‘to preserve’, and ‘to eliminate’. In ordinary German, aufheben has only one of these senses
     on any given occasion of its use. However, in his later works, Hegel often uses it in at least
     two of its senses at once, ‘preserve’ and ‘eliminate’, and sometimes in all three senses. The
     idea is conveyed by our expression ‘kick somebody upstairs’, that is, to promote them to a
     rank or position that is officially superior but in fact carries less power and influence. The
     Latin verb tollo has a similar ambiguity and its irregular past participle sublatus gave rise to
     the coinage ‘sublate’        in translations of Hegel. In PS, Hegel’s later usage is not yet fully
     developed and he often uses Aufhebung                 in the sense of ‘elimination’ alone. But in ¶113 he
     explicitly uses it in his later sense.
Substance: Substanz. Subject: Subjekt. Sometimes in the Preface, and once in the Introduction,
     Subjekt is the counterpart to Objekt. But the central contrast, even in the Preface, is between
     Subjekt    and   Substanz, as in ¶17. Here Hegel has in mind Spinoza’s substance and his
     supposed neglect of the subject, but he also applies the contrast to social orders, ancient
     Greece having a predominance of substance over subject, while the French revolutionary
     order has a predominance of subject over substance: see e.g. ¶587 on the alternating
     interplay between substance and subject. Substance is the cultural background from
     which individuals emerge, while the subject is the active individual(s) emerging from it.
     Substance is comparable to             langue    and subject to        parole: as there can be no speakers
     without an underlying language, and no language without speakers, so there can be no
     coherent agents without an underlying culture and no culture without agents to create and
     sustain it. Hegel explores and exploits different aspects of the word ‘subject’, especially the
     grammatical subject, which is a passive recipient of predicates, but which may also be a
     dynamic subject, performing the activity denoted by a verb and so converging with the
     human subject: see e.g. ¶66.
Syllogism: Schluss. Hegel’s conception of ‘extremes’ united by a ‘middle term’ derives from his
     conception of a syllogism. A simple traditional syllogism is:
    Major premise:         All men are mortal
    Minor premise:         All Greeks are men
    Conclusion:        All Greeks are mortal
---
          

    The middle term is the term that appears in both premises, but not in the conclusion, in this
    case ‘man/men’. It is called the ‘middle term’, because it links together the two ‘end terms’
    or   ‘extremes’     appearing in the conclusion. Hegel applies this terminology to the link
    between any two opposites, which need not be, and usually are not, terms in propositions,
    though he does not hesitate to refer to their relationship as a ‘syllogism’, a move facilitated
    by the fact that the Germanic word for ‘syllogism’ is (logischer) Schluss, which also means
    ‘conclusion’     or ‘closure’. In Chapter III, the middle term is often little more than the unity
    or contact between two opposing forces (¶¶136, 141). For example, a balloon retains its size
    and shape owing to the interplay between the air pressure within the balloon (which tends
    to expand the balloon so as to become equal to the pressure of the air outside) and the
    elasticity of the material from which the balloon is made (which tends to contract the
    balloon). The stable balloon itself is then the middle term. In ¶146 the middle term is more
    substantial: it is the ‘appearance’ between the understanding and the ‘interior’, that is, the
    scientifically postulated laws and entities underlying perceptible appearance. See also ¶184,
    where      the   middle      term     is  self-consciousness,         which     links    together     the    two    self-
    consciousnesses that emerge from it.
Thing, thing: Sache, Ding: German has two words for ‘thing’,                        Ding and Sache. They are often
    used interchangeably, as in ¶73. But this is not always so. Ding is as neutral as the English
    ‘thing’, though in Hegel it often has the derogatory                   flavour of a    mere thing, in contrast to
    higher entities such as the mind, as in ‘He treats me as a thing!’ The thing with properties in
    ¶¶111ff. is a Ding. Sache, by contrast, suggests objectivity and importance. It is the thing at
    issue or at stake, somewhat as in ‘That’s the thing!’ and ‘The thing is that . . . ’ or ‘The play’s
    the thing!’    Hegel often stresses this by speaking of die Sache selbst,                 ‘the Thing itself ’, e.g. in
    ¶1. Sache resists any single, consistent rendering in English, but is readily translatable into
    French as      ‘Chose’   and Italian as     ‘Cosa’   (as in   ‘cosa nostra’). In some contexts, such as ¶1,
    Sache is roughly equivalent to ‘(subject-)matter’, but not in all. In ¶409 Sache is used in two
    ways: die Sache selbst is the thing that matters, while the simple Sache does not matter, and
    is roughly equivalent to Ding. I have therefore chosen to capitalize Sache as ‘Thing’, in order
    to differentiate it from Ding          (‘thing’), while preserving its semantic affinity to it. The word
    Sache is sufficiently potent in Hegel’s usage to require a uniform translation throughout.
Thinking: Denken. Thought: Gedanke. In English                      ‘thought’ has a similar ambiguity to that of
    ‘work’: it means both the activity or process of thinking (as in ‘I was absorbed in thought’)
    and its product (as in         ‘I have had a brilliant thought’). I have translated the verbal noun
    Denken as ‘thinking’, even where ‘thought’ would be a more natural rendering, and reserved
    ‘thought’ for its object or product,           Gedanke. See also ¶30 and note, for a narrower sense of
    ‘thinking’, where it contrasts with ‘representation’, and a wider sense, in which it includes
    representation.
True, truth: wahr, Wahrheit: Hegel uses these words in a variety of ways, and not only, or even
    primarily, in the sense of ‘corresponding to the facts’. In the Preface, das Wahre, ‘the true’,
    is generally something like the absolute, the complete and undiluted truth (e.g. ¶17), while
    elsewhere it is often what is regarded as the truth by a particular shape of consciousness.
    The truth of something is often its fulfilment or what it amounts to. The ‘truth of ’ any given
    stage in the growth of a plant is the immediately following stage, e.g. the truth of a bud is the
    leaf or    flower. The truth simpliciter is the fully-grown plant. Similarly, the truth of any
    given shape of consciousness is its immediate successor, but only at the final stage do we get
    undiluted truth. See note to ¶798.             ‘(Un)true’     sometimes amounts to            ‘(un)real’, as in ¶¶76
    and 78.
Work: Werk. Labour: Arbeit. ‘Work’ in English applies both to the activity and to its product.
    I have translated       Arbeit    as ‘labour’, where      ‘work’    would result in ambiguity, and Werk as
    ‘work’, but occasionally as ‘artefact’ or            ‘product’.

Commentary

         Preface
¶1. 1. The capitalized ‘Thing’ translates Sache, in contrast to Ding, ‘thing’, which Hegel uses in
    A.II for the ‘thing’ that has ‘properties’ and is the object of ‘perception’. Sache means ‘thing’,
    but also ‘affair, business, (subject-)matter’. While               Ding is often pejorative, in Hegel’s usage
    Sache    carries a suggestion of the thing ‘at stake/issue’, as does ‘thing’ in such expressions as
    ‘The thing is . . . ’, ‘That’s just the thing (for . . . )’, ‘do one’s own thing’, ‘make a thing of it’,
    ‘have a thing about . . . ’.
     2. Hegel invariably uses the word Element in the sense of a ‘milieu’ or ‘environment’ (as in
     being ‘in your element’), not in the sense of a simple principle or constituent.
     3. Here, and elsewhere, ‘idea’ translates Vorstellung, when Hegel uses the word informally,
     and not in his technical sense of ‘representation’ in contrast to ‘thought’, ‘concept’, etc. The
     lower case ‘idea’      is quite distinct from the capitalized ‘Idea’, which stands for                     Idee rather
     than   Vorstellung.
     4. Hegel objects to two main features of the customary preface, its inclusion of material
     irrelevant to the philosophical work itself (the Thing)—such as the author’s reasons for
     writing it—and its tendency to summarize the main conclusions of the work, while
     omitting the systematic argumentation and the elaboration of details.
¶2. 1.   ‘Opinion’ here translates         Meinung. Later, especially in ¶¶90ff., it is translated as ‘mean-
    ing’, in accordance with one of the senses of its parent verb, meinen, which means both
    ‘opine, believe’ and ‘mean, intend’.
     2.  ‘Being-there’      is a literal translation of the German                 Dasein, which normally means
    ‘existence’ (and sometimes ‘life’). But since Hegel also uses Existenz, and differentiates it
    from Dasein, ‘existence’ needs to be reserved for the former. Dasein is the determinate Being
    of something, its concrete and tangible expression or embodiment.
     3. Hegel deploys two distinct conceptions of truth and falsity: one concerns the extent to
    which an entity fulfils or realizes the concept of an entity of that type, asking e.g. whether a
    sapling is true (or ‘real’) tree, so-and-so is a true friend, or this is a true work of art; the other
    concerns the extent to which an entity, such as a proposition, a theory, or a philosophical
    system accurately represents reality or the way things really are. Only the first conception
    applies to a plant. Both conceptions apply to a philosophy. We can ask both ‘Is Hegel a true
    philosopher?’ and ‘Is Hegel’s philosophy true?’ The answers to these questions need not be
    the same.
¶3. 1. Hegel has two main arguments: first, a philosopher’s aim is a                          ‘lifeless universal’    unless
    we know his arguments for it and the applications made of it or the conclusions drawn from
    it; secondly, to focus on the respects in which one thing differs from others implies a
    superficial view of it, since the difference between one thing and another lies at the boundary
    or ‘limit’ (Grenze) of the thing. The           first argument is acceptable: to say simply that Kant is a
    ‘transcendental idealist’, while Hegel is an ‘objective idealist’                  is uninformative. The second
    argument is unacceptable. Differences can be superficial (such as the difference between white
    and black swans) or significant (such as that between vertebrates and invertebrates). To ask
    ‘What is the difference between Kant and Hegel?’ may lead to the heart of their thought.
¶4. 1. Life involves three stages: (1) The              ‘immediacy of substantial life’; (2) the beginning of
    education or ‘culture’        (Bildung); (3) the serious business of ‘life in its fullness’. Stage (1) is
---
     

   life that is simply lived, unreflectively. Hegel’s opponents have ascended to stage (2), but
   only to an imperfect version of it: they have not fully mastered the ‘Thing’ (Sache) or subject-
   matter. Stage (2) initially separates us from ‘substantial life’, but at stage (3) we apply the
   culture we have acquired to ‘life’. This gives us a deeper insight into, an ‘experience’                         of, the
   ‘Thing’. It also enriches life. Even if we pursue conceptual thought, probing the ‘depths’ of
   the Thing, the ‘information’ and capacity for ‘assessment’ acquired at stage (2) still have a
   place in informal philosophical conversation, as long as they are excluded from serious
   philosophy itself and preceded by a rigorous initiation into ‘culture’. Hegel’s triad follows
   the pattern of (1) immediate absorption in life; (2) separation from life; and (3) a sophisticated
   reunification with life.
¶5. 1. The word        ‘philosophy’      derives from Greek words for              ‘love’   and   ‘wisdom’, and thus
   originally meant ‘love (philo-) of wisdom (sophia)’, rather than simply ‘wisdom’ or knowledge.
    2. The ‘inner necessity’          that knowledge should become science is the atemporal logical
   structure of the Thing itself, which (like the plan embedded in an acorn) requires that a true
   philosophy (like a true oak-tree) develop into an expansive and diversified, but coherent
   system, and prescribes the stages of this development. The                            ‘external necessity’       is the
   realization of this plan by one or more philosophers, which, apart from personal contin-
   gencies, follows the same order in time as the logical order in the atemporal plan. Hegel’s
   adoption and fulfilment of this systematic aim will show the necessity of them (rather than
   their mere possibility), analogously to the way in which the growth of an oak-tree from an
   acorn shows, given favourable circumstances, the necessity of its doing so. To the objection
   that the existence of substantial             unsystematic       philosophers, such as Friedrich Schlegel
   (1772–1829) and, later, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, shows that systematic philosophy is
   not inevitable; Hegel might reply that unsystematic philosophies cannot incorporate their
   philosophical predecessors in the way that Hegel purports to do and that they therefore
   resist inclusion in the philosophical canon.
¶6. 1 Hegel’s opponents deny that ‘the absolute’ can be conceptually defined, as, say, a triangle
   can, or its existence and nature inferred, in the way that we infer that the angles of a triangle
   make two right angles. Although the absolute, i.e. that which does not depend on anything
   else for its existence or nature, need not amount to God in the traditional sense, Hegel’s
   opponents usually applied this to God: see                  Enc. I, ¶¶61–78 on Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi
   (1743–1819). God, or God’s existence, can, they argued, be intuited, felt, etc. but not
   analysed and proven. The claim that, on this view, ‘the true’, i.e. God or the absolute, exists
   ‘as’ intuition, etc., not simply ‘in’         intuition, etc. reflects the doctrine that such            ‘immediate’
   mental states, unlike conceptual knowledge, become identical with their object. On this
   view, the believer is not only ‘in the centre of divine love’, but is ‘the Being of this centre
   itself ’; the believer has become identical with God. The reference to                            ‘love’   is perhaps
   inspired by Spinoza, who played an important role in Jacobi’s thought and who, at the
   climax of his Ethics, advocates an ‘intellectual love of God’ that is identical with, or at least
   a part of, God’s love of himself: ‘the mind’s intellectual love of God is part of the love by
   which God loves himself ’           (Ethics, V, proposition 36). In          Enc. I, ¶86 Hegel quotes Jacobi’s
   remark that Spinoza’s God is the                 ‘principium of Being [des Seins] in all Being-there
   [Dasein]’, adding that ‘Being’ (das Sein) is a supremely thin concept. The reference to
   ‘Being’ in this Preface may also be intended to imply that if God is accessible only to
   intuition, etc., we can say no more about God than that he ‘is’                          or ‘is Being’, an all but
   empty characterization of God.
¶7. 1. Spirit’s former       ‘substantial life’     is the traditional religious faith that has been under-
   mined, at least among the educated classes, by                 ‘insubstantial reflection of itself into itself ’,
   i.e. by the enlightenment. Spirit, i.e. the educated classes, wants to regain its substantial
   life. There are two ways in which this might be achieved. There is,                              first, the rigorous
---
                                                                                                             

    philosophical thinking that Hegel recommends, thinking the enlightenment through con-
    ceptually. Secondly, there is the mush of feeling, etc. offered by the romantics.
¶8. 1.   ‘Singular, singularity, singleton, etc.’ translate einzeln, and its variants.                  ‘Individual(ity)’
    would be a more appropriate translation, were it not for the fact that Hegel also uses
    individuell, Individualität, and          Individuum, and differentiates them from einzeln, etc.
     2. There are three stages: (1) Before the enlightenment, there was a rich and elaborate
    religious faith. Heaven had a lot in it, but worldly things were neglected. (2) The enlight-
    enment (Voltaire, Diderot, Kant, etc.) turned us away from heaven to worldly things and
    affairs. Religion is neglected. (3) As the enlightenment waned, attempts were made to revive
    religion. A prime example is Friedrich Schleiermacher’s On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured
    Despisers (1799, 3rd edition 1821), proclaiming that religion is ‘feeling and intuition of the
    universe’, a    ‘sense for the infinite in the finite’, and so on. Schleiermacher was a member of
    the romantic circle (the Schlegels, Novalis, etc.), who were the most prominent of religion’s
    cultivated despisers, and his interpretation of religion bears traces of romantic philosophy.
    His account of religion is thin and unappetizing, as compared with pre-enlightenment faith.
    If we had not lost so much, we would not be satisfied with so little.
¶10. 1.    Horos is Greek for a        ‘boundary stone’, hence a symbol for determinacy and distinct-
    ness. Finite things are determinate and determinate things are                         finite, bounded by other
    things distinct from them. In the view of Hegel’s adversaries, concepts apply only to finite
    things, marking off one thing, or type of thing, from another. Necessity too is characteristic
    of  finite things: one finite thing necessitates another. Reflection is here the consideration of
    something distinct from oneself. It implies the finitude of its object: what is distinct from
    oneself is ipso facto finite or bounded, at least bounded by and exclusive of oneself. Hegel’s
    adversaries want to go beyond finite things to God or the ‘essence’ underlying them all. God
    is not determinate, not just one thing among others, not distinct even from the philoso-
    phizing Self. So they propose to abandon concepts, necessity, and reflection, and to
    submerge themselves in the essence.
¶11. 1.    ‘Physiognomy’       denotes the features of someone’s face that enable us to discern their
    character, and also the art of interpreting them: see PS ¶¶ 309ff. Here it applies more
    generally to the overall character of the world. A steady quantitative change (e.g. a decrease
    in temperature) does not produce a corresponding qualitative change in the physiognomy
    of water, until at a certain point the water turns to ice: Enc. I, ¶¶107f. The new world has, it
    seems, just been born.
¶12. 1. The new world has emerged but is still only comparable to an infant or an acorn. It
    embodies the concept of the new world, but the concept is not actualized or realized as a
    full-grown adult or oak. Science follows the same course as the world. When the new world
    is complete it will be crowned by a science that is also complete. But as yet science is only at
    the acorn stage, corresponding to the acorn stage of the society it adorns. This acorn society
    is the result of a long and expansive process, rather as the literal acorn is the product of the
    growth of an expansive oak. The long process of the oak-tree’s growth is now concentrated
    in the simple acorn. But this acorn will now grow into an oak, regurgitating the elements
    and stages that entered into its formation. Similarly, the new society will also develop,
    regurgitating in an altered form the ‘configurations’ or ‘moments’ that went to make it up.
¶13. 1. Science, like society as a whole, is still at the acorn stage. Before an idea is worked out in
    detail it can be understood by a few cognoscenti. But once it is expanded into an intelligible
    form everyone can understand it, since everyone can think and everyone is an I or ego,
    which is just what understanding is. Hegel’s optimistic egalitarianism depends on his
    conviction that people understand the abstract, the                      ‘intelligible’, more readily than the
    concrete, that, for example, they understand ‘a+b=b+a’ more easily than                             ‘5+7=7+5’, and
    this more easily than ‘If I start with 5 apples and then acquire 7 more apples, I end up with
---
     

   the same number of apples as someone who starts with 7 apples and then acquires 5 more
   apples’. We should note, however, Aristotle’s distinction between what is more intelligible
   intrinsically and what is more intelligible             to us: e.g. Posterior Analytics        I, 2, 71b33–72a8.
¶14. 1. The two sides are: innovators who propose a new science or theory which is still in an
   inchoate form, and their critics who demand articulation and elaboration. The critics point
   to the material that the new theory does not yet accommodate and make intelligible. The
   innovators insist that their theory is guaranteed by                  ‘immediate rationality’. The critics are
   browbeaten by the innovators, but also get bored by their failure to elaborate and articulate
   their theory. Hegel has a foot in both camps. He wants a big idea, a large unifying theory, not
   just a mass of details, but he also wants to accommodate empirical material.
¶15. 1. The      ‘others’   are the innovators of ¶14, viz. proponents of a new theory that is
   undeveloped to accommodate empirical material, but who sometimes make inadequate
   attempts to accommodate it. The material is already ‘well ordered’, ‘prepared’, and ‘familiar’,
   not discovered, classified, etc. by the new theory, but simply taken over from previous
   theories and observations. By stressing ‘oddities and curiosities’ the new theorist can appear
   to know more than he really does, even material not yet organized by other theories. The
   material is incorporated in the new theory by applying the same ‘principle’ or ‘formula’. The
   formula explains nothing, since it is applied to everything in exactly the same way. (Hegel’s
   thought is akin to Karl Popper’s criticism of theories whose attempt to explain anything and
   everything in the same way renders them unfalsifiable.) Hegel refers to theories that
   postulate the ‘absolute Idea’ (absolute Idee) and implies that this Idea is ‘true’ ‘for itself ’,
   roughly that it is valid or genuine—apart from its underdevelopment and misapplication.
   Since he himself later endorsed a theory in which the absolute Idea is central—though the
   expression ‘absolute Idea’ occurs in PS only here—he is presumably criticizing theories that
   are impoverished versions of his own theory or can plausibly be interpreted as such. This
   suggests that the implicit target of his criticism is his friend Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph
   Schelling.
¶16. 1. The ‘absolute’ is the fundamental reality on which everything else depends, but is itself
   independent of anything else. Schelling evacuated the absolute of any determinate character,
   allegedly by a procedure akin to that of refuting any idea by imagining the contrary:
   on   ‘empty possibility’, e.g.       ‘The moon will fall to the earth tonight’, see                 Enc. I, ¶143. A
   determinate character contrasts with and excludes other determinate characters. If the
   absolute is spirit, it contrasts with what is other than mind, viz. nature. This has unwelcome
   consequences: the absolute is dependent on nature, since a determinate character owes its
   determinacy to what it contrasts with. The absolute does not explain the existence of spirit,
   nor why the world bifurcates into spirit and nature; spirit is already presupposed. The
   absolute is arbitrarily lopsided, assigning priority to one aspect of the world over the other.
   Schelling tried to derive spirit from nature, just as, conversely, he tried to derive nature from
   spirit. But if the two derivations are of equal status, then spirit and nature are of equal status.
   This suggests that the absolute underlying both is neither spirit nor nature, but neutral
   and indeterminate. The formula ‘A=A’                   expresses such indeterminacy, implying that the
   absolute’s only characteristic is self-identity.
¶17. 1. The ‘true’ or absolute is, in Hegel’s view, both substance and subject. The doctrine that
   the true (or ‘God’) is substance and not subject is implicitly ascribed to Spinoza,—and
   explicitly in e.g. the Preface to the second, 1827, edition of Enc.I. The word ‘subject’                             has
   several meanings, at least two of which are in play here. First, a subject is the individual
   human (or possibly divine) subject, in particular the knowing subject in contrast to the
   object known, but also an agent, especially a moral agent. Secondly, it is the subject of a
   predicate, especially a verb: sometimes, though not invariably, the subject is said to perform
   the action expressed by the verb. In these respects ‘subject’ contrasts with ‘substance’, which
---
                                                                                                             

    is conceived by Spinoza as undifferentiated rather than individualized, as prior to the
    knowing subject, and as intrinsically inactive, requiring (in Hegel’s interpretation) the
    intervention of the human intellect for its differentiation and individualization.
       Hegel sets out three responses to Spinoza: (1) To accept that self-consciousness is
    ‘submerged’ in the substance, primarily because the Self is not an independent entity, but
    an accident or ‘mode’ of substance, merely a blush on the cheek of the absolute. (2) To insist
    on the independence of the thinking Self. For Hegel a philosophy is not                                     fixed and
    unequivocal, so he may regard this move as sanctioned by Spinoza himself. His second
    sentence: ‘substantiality includes . . . for knowledge’               perhaps refers to Spinoza’s view that
    thought as well as extension is an attribute of substance. This does not satisfy Hegel, since in
    Spinoza’s account both knowledge, or the ‘universal’, and its object,                      ‘Being’, are immediate,
    not mediated by each other nor by substance itself, but just postulated as inexplicable facts.
    Moreover, according to Spinoza, in its usual condition the human mind is, like the human
    body, buffeted and determined by the entities surrounding it, though a philosopher can, by
    his understanding of God or nature, break free of his immediate surroundings, attaining the
    ‘intellectual love of God’. There are, however, more wholehearted proponents of (2), such as
    Kant and Fichte. They regard the I or ego as primary and its object, nature, as partly (Kant)
    or wholly (Fichte) derivative from it. Hegel implies, however, that the I, or at least ‘thinking
    as thinking’, is as uniform and inert as Spinoza’s substance: cf.                    Enc. I, ¶86.
       Position (3) is presented as a combination of positions (1) and (2), and said in Enc. I, ¶86
    to give primacy to a          ‘definition or intuition of the absolutely true’                 and to     ‘intellectual
    intuition’. The absolute is substance, as for Spinoza, but with two differences. First,
    ‘thinking’ is not simply one of the attributes of substance and therefore subordinate to it:
    thinking is united with substance and therefore on a par with it. Secondly, substance is
    accessible to     ‘intellectual intuition’. This accords with Spinoza’s idea of                    ‘intuitive know-
    ledge’, which ‘proceeds from an adequate idea of certain attributes of God to adequate
    cognition of the essence of things’ (Ethics, II, 40, scholium 2). But (3) is more obviously the
    position of Schelling. Hegel rejects it, owing to his aversion to sheer immediacy. Rather than
    simply asserting that substance is also subject, we must derive the idea of the subject from
    that of substance. Rather than simply accepting that the                          ‘actual’, i.e. concrete reality,
    develops out of the absolute, we must characterize the absolute in such a way that it is
    able to generate the actual, and characterize our knowledge of the absolute in such a way
    that we are able to show how it generates it. A mere substance cannot create, and intellectual
    intuition cannot explain creation. The absolute must be an active, creative subject. It does
    not follow that it must also be a knowing and willing subject. Hegel generally neglects the
    distinction between these two senses of ‘subject’. This may be because he links together three
    ways in which Spinoza allegedly neglected the                  ‘subject’: Spinoza’s God is not a knowing or
    purposive subject; Spinoza’s God is not sufficiently active to create concrete reality; and
    Spinoza did not allow for a unitary human subject, but regarded the human mind as a
    conglomerate of ‘ideas’—in a manner similar to Hume’s                        ‘bundle’ theory of the Self. Then
    Hegel has some difficulty in seeing how an absolute that is not a knowing, purposive subject
    could generate concrete reality, in particular unitary human selves. He also has difficulty in
    seeing how unitary human subjects can be entirely distinct from God, that is, how, given the
    existence of human subjects, God can fail to be some sort of knowing, willing subject.
¶18. 1. Substance is ‘living’ in that it is self-actualizing. It is ‘Being’               (das Sein), not simply one
    being among others. It is the ‘movement of self-positing’                   rather than something that moves
    or posits itself since it cannot be distinguished from its activity. It is ‘self-positing’ in that it
    actualizes or manifests itself in concrete reality, trees, rocks, rivers, etc. It acts as an
    intermediary between itself and             ‘becoming-other-to-itself ’, generating the concrete reality
    that expresses or manifests it, because it is                ‘pure simple negativity’: the simple subject
---
      

    negates   itself, so that it bifurcates or splits in two. Initially, the two parties of the                 ‘opposing
    duplication’     resulting from the bifurcation, the subject itself and concrete reality, are
    different from, and        ‘indifferent’ to, each other, but the indifferent diversity is negated, the
    original ‘equality’ of the subject to itself is restored, and in ‘otherness’ the subject is reflected
    back into itself: it sees its own reflection in the mirror it has created.                              ‘Duplication’
    (Verdopplung) also occurs in the encounter of two self-consciousnesses, in PS ¶¶176ff.: at
    first, the I is confronted by an alien world, the objects of its ‘consciousness’, but when it
    meets another self-consciousness it sees a duplicate of itself. The development of the
    absolute follows the same pattern: the original unity (the subject) splits in two (the subject
    and concrete reality), and then finds itself again in the world confronting it (human beings).
    The ‘true’ is not just the first stage of this process; it is the whole process in which God (the
    beginning) creates a world other than himself and then finds himself (the end) in the world.
    However, Hegel need not claim that the active subject is also a knowing, purposive subject.
    Even if the subject is blind energy, it still generates a diversified world different from itself,
    which eventually provides a sort of duplicate of blind energy—in the form, say, of human
    beings who experiment with it, write about it, etc.—though we shall be less inclined to say
    that this ‘equality’ is the ‘goal’ of blind energy. It remains the case that the true is the whole
    process, not just the energy that initiates it.
¶19. 1.   ‘Love’s play with itself ’ does not refer to solitary masturbation, but to the idea that each
    of two lovers identifies him- or herself with the other. Thus each of the pair, in playing with
    the other, is in a way playing with him- or herself. Because of this identity in difference, love
    is an appropriate metaphor for God’s relationship both with other members of the Trinity
    and with the world he creates. In Hegel (1895) III, pp.11 and 35, Hegel applies the
    metaphor to the eternal (or atemporal) triplicity within God, while PS ¶19 applies it to
    God’s creation, and subsequent redemption, of the world, which, in contrast to God’s inner
    triune life, requires      ‘alienation’    (Entfremdung) of himself, and then the labour of redis-
    covering himself in the world. However, God as the ‘essence’, i.e. the atemporal triune God,
    involves the ‘form’ in which the essence is to develop, and so also involves temporal creation
    and redemption, whereby the ‘in-itself ’, God as merely potential, becomes ‘for itself ’, fully
    actual, and also self-aware.
         Hegel prefers discursive cognition to immediate intuition, but blurs the distinction
    between God’s cognition of himself and man’s cognition of God. This is because he tends to
    equate them: it is in man’s cognition that God recognizes himself in his creation and
    overcomes his alienation.
¶20. 1. An acorn is essentially the germ of an oak-tree. Similarly, the absolute is essentially
    the germ of the world. This might seem contradictory. First, it seems impossible that the
    absolute (or an acorn) should             become     itself; surely anything is already itself, at whatever
    stage it has reached, and has no need or tendency to become itself. (This difficulty might be
    resolved if, instead of saying            ‘The absolute (or an acorn) becomes itself ’                  we say      ‘The
    absolute (or acorn) actualizes its potential(ity)’. This leaves the absolute in itself potential
    rather than actual.) Secondly, the absolute is the ultimate that does not depend on anything
    else; but if it is only the absolute if and insofar as it generates a world that is other than
    itself, then it depends on what it creates. Thirdly, Hegel’s zoological analogy suggests that
    his opponents (under the influence of neo-Platonism) generalized this to a prohibition on
    all predications of the absolute, not only on predications that introduce its creation. The
    phrase    ‘All animals’      not only neglects different types of animal, it says nothing about
    animals at all. Thus Plotinus argued that the ‘One’ that generates everything cannot share
    any property with its products or allow any predicate to mar its simplicity (Enneads, VI. 8.8;
    VI.9.3, 5, 6, 8). Naturally Plotinus does say things about the One, but we are supposed to
    ‘take them away’, i.e. add that we should not really have said it. Aquinas was equally
---
                                                                                                             

    concerned to preserve God’s simplicity, but ‘took away’ predications of him in a different
    manner: God can be said to be wise, just, etc., but whereas Socrates’s wisdom and justice are
    distinct from Socrates himself, God’s wisdom and justice are identical with God.
         Yovel (2005, p.103) plausibly suggests that Hegel effected ‘a becoming-other that must
    be taken back’ in yet another way, retracting the initial predication by further predications.
    The subject      ‘becomes other’ when a predicate is ascribed to it: e.g. if we say ‘Man is an
    animal’, man becomes other than himself, namely an animal. But if we add a further
    predicate, ‘rational’, we restore man to his original status, only on a higher, more explicit
    plane: ‘Man is a rational animal’. The absolute is more complex, but the principle is the
    same. We start by saying, e.g. ‘The absolute is pure Being’, which makes it other than itself,
    and eventually (by the end of Hegel’s Logic, at least by the end of his system) we arrive at a
    way of speaking about the absolute that is adequate to it and restores it to its initial
    grandeur. Hegel’s Logic can be seen initially as a series of predications of the absolute or
    God. Here Hegel agrees with Aquinas and disagrees with Plotinus. But he disagrees with
    Aquinas in at least two respects. First, the subject-term, ‘God’ or ‘the absolute’ is, in Hegel’s
    view, dispensable: whatever content it has is supplied by the                           ‘predicate’: see PS ¶23.
    Secondly, the predicates or, as they are now more appropriately called, the                                 ‘thought-
    determinations’       are systematically derived from, and interconnected with, each other. So
    the absolute is not simple, but nor is it a mere bearer of predicates: it is a network of
    systematically interrelated concepts. That is the absolute itself. The next step is the realiza-
    tion of this absolute in the world, the world of nature and the world of mind. Here too Hegel
    disagrees with Plotinus and Aquinas. He believes that the absolute is essentially incomplete
    without the world. In religious terms, God becomes conscious of himself in mankind; in
    philosophical terms, the thought-determinations constituting the absolute must become our
    thoughts in order to reach their full actualization. So ‘mediation’ enters into Hegel’s thought
    in two ways. It is involved in both what is said about the absolute itself and in the absolute’s
    realization of itself in the world.
¶21. 1. Hegel’s stress on simplicity suggests that his adversaries’                         aversion to      ‘mediation’
    depends on their belief that the absolute is entirely simple. If the absolute were complex,
    would it not require something else to explain its cohesion and therefore be dependent
    rather than absolute? His reply is that mediation preserves, rather than destroys, simplicity
    and immediacy. Something is mediated if it results from or depends on some process,
    whether a logical or a causal process. Something is immediate if it does not result from or
    depend on any such process. However, nothing is entirely immediate and nothing is entirely
    mediated. Whether something is immediate or mediated depends on the point of view from
    which we consider it. An acorn, e.g., is immediate in comparison with the tree that grows
    from it, but mediated in comparison with the tree it grew on. It is mediated owing to the
    process that gives rise to it, but immediate because this mediating process is reflected ‘into
    itself ’, bent back into the concentrated simplicity of the acorn. Hegel’s own example is more
    complicated, since the result of the mediation (the self-conscious I) is of a higher grade than
    the immediate starting-point (the embryo). (A closer analogue of the acorn–tree–acorn
    sequence is the embryo–adult–embryo sequence, the conception of a new embryo by a
    human adult. But this would not serve Hegel’s purpose here.) The embryo is human                                     ‘in
    itself ’, i.e. intrinsically and potentially, but not             ‘for itself ’, i.e. consciously and actually.
    A rational adult has made itself into an actual human being, aware of its own humanity, not
    simple and immediate in the way that an embryo, let alone an acorn, is. But it is reflected
    into itself (and also reflects on itself ) as        ‘self-conscious freedom’, a simple I or ego that can
    distinguish itself from any, even all, of its bodily states. (We might think here of Descartes,
    doubting the very existence of his body and forgetting the mediating intellectual processes
    that led up to his thought ‘I am’.) There is thus                ‘opposition’    between the simple I and the
---
      

    diverse physical and mental processes giving rise to it. But the I ‘sublates’ this opposition, is
    ‘reconciled’ with its opposite: it instils habits into its body, making it conform to its will, and
    it discerns a rational order in the world, finding it a suitable abode; it comes to see the
    diverse processes leading up to it as converging on itself. Then the I is                       ‘at rest’, not at war
    with its surroundings or its becoming—rather like the embryo in the womb.
¶22. 1. Kant distinguished between internal and external teleology or                              ‘purposiveness’: see
    Critique of Judgement, ¶66. External teleology explains one type of thing by the purpose it
    serves for another type of thing, e.g. the sheep’s wool by our need for clothes:                                Enc. II,
    ¶245Z. Hegel, along with his scientifically educated contemporaries, rejected external
    teleology, but (like Aristotle and Kant) accepted internal teleology (Enc. I, ¶204; Enc. II,
    ¶¶245, 360; Hegel (1895) II, pp. 148–65; and PS ¶44). This is the purposiveness that is
    immanent in a single entity, usually a living organism, and accounts for its growth and
    structure. The organism is its own end or an end in itself, not a means to some further end:
    sheep’s wool is to be explained by what it does for the sheep, not what it does for us. (But the
    distinction is muddied by cases of symbiosis between different plant and animal species.)
    The purpose need not be conscious, not God’s purpose or the purpose of any conscious
    being. (Aristotle believes in a god, an ‘unmoved mover’, but it is not immediately involved in
    the growth of natural organisms, except insofar as it stimulates them to actualize their
    potentiality.) There are three stages in the development of a purpose (Enc. I, ¶¶206–12). At
    first it is unrealized and ‘subjective’: it is, e.g., merely implicit in the acorn. Next, it is in the
    course of realizing itself and is then ‘objective’: at this stage the objective purpose does not
    fully correspond to the subjective purpose. Finally, the purpose is fully realized in the full-
    grown tree. Throughout this whole sequence the purpose itself, or                               ‘concept’, remains
    constant: it makes the tree grow, but it does not itself move or change. It is not a stick,
    but a carrot, which is independent (‘being-for-itself ’) of the current stage of the organism’s
    growth and negates it.
       Internal teleology does not, in Aristotle’s and Kant’s view, require consciousness. So why
    does Hegel introduce the ‘Self ’          here? The Self is what persists throughout change; it makes
    the organism a single, developing entity rather than a series of successive entities. An
    organism aims at its own self-preservation, and an animal, if not a plant, is relatively self-
    contained and independent of its surroundings. However, Hegel may have in mind
    the knowing and willing Self, rather as in ¶17 he moves easily from the active subject to
    the knowing and willing subject.
¶23. 1. The ‘ancients’ in question are primarily Plato and his followers, who postulated ‘forms’
    or ‘Ideas’, such as goodness and beauty, but did not regard them as predicates of God or as
    requiring the support of a deity in any other way.
      2. Several senses of ‘subject’ are in play. The sense needed by Hegel’s opponents to present
    the absolute as subject is that of an independent entity, a bearer of predicates, not a predicate
    of anything else or a free-floating ‘universal’. That ‘the absolute’ is replaced by the word ‘God’
    might suggest that the ‘subject’ is a knowing, willing subject. But that cannot be what Hegel
    has in mind, since he regards ‘God’ as a ‘senseless sound’: knowing, willing, and whatever else
    God may be have to be assigned to him by predicates. In a proposition such as ‘God is love’
    (cf. 1 John 4:16; Hegel (1895) II, p.221) ‘God’               is the  grammatical subject, while ‘(is) love’ is
    the predicate. That       ‘God’   is a  ‘senseless sound’      could mean any of four things: (1) ‘God’                is
    intrinsically   senseless; we could have assigned it no meaning at all, or an entirely different
    meaning. This is true, but since it applies to every word, it cannot be what Hegel has in mind.
    ‘Love’, etc. are also senseless in this respect and could not therefore confer meaning on the
    word ‘God’ if they shared its disqualification. (2) ‘God is love’, etc. are putative definitions of
    ‘God’. When a word is defined, its meaning is held in abeyance until it is supplied or restored
    by the   definiens. Again, however, this applies not simply to ‘God’, but to any word up for
---
                                                                                                          

definition. So it is not what Hegel mainly has in mind, though it may play a part in his
argument. (3) There are constraints on the significant use of ‘God’. We cannot say ‘God is the
London transport system’ or ‘God is a prime number’, except in jest or irreverence. But ‘God’
is indeterminate in meaning in a way that                    ‘horse’ or    ‘Napoleon’     are not. We engage in
significant and radical disagreements about his (or her or its) existence, number, and nature.
The three propositions         ‘God is the eternal’       (Jakob Böhme?), ‘God is the moral world-order’
(Fichte), and ‘God is love’ illustrate this indeterminacy. (4) Such meaning as the word ‘God’
has, apart from and prior to these metaphysical predications—e.g. the supreme being who
created the universe,—should not be presupposed in philosophical inquiry. It derives from
the  Vorstellung, pictorial imagination or ‘representation’, of ordinary believers and has no
place in philosophy. This is also true of predicates, such as                  ‘love’, and even of      ‘being’, ‘one’,
etc. Philosophers may refine the meanings of such terms but they do not introduce them
from scratch. At some point they must use words as non-philosophers do. Hegel has to
‘analyse’ the notion of love before applying it to God (Hegel (1895) II, p. 221), but what he
analyses and refines is the ordinary meaning of the word. So although this line of thought
plays a part in Hegel’s qualms about                  ‘God’, we cannot dispense with (3), the relative
indeterminacy of its meaning in comparison with ‘love’, etc.
   If ‘God’ is a senseless sound why do Hegel’s targets not simply speak of ‘the eternal’, etc. or
‘Being’ (Sein) or ‘the One’, omitting the word ‘God’ altogether? If ‘God is love’, etc. were
straightforward definitions it would be hard to find an answer. If ‘The horse is a four-legged
herbivorous mammal with solid hooves, etc.’ correctly defines the word ‘horse’, then the
word ‘horse’ can be replaced by its               definiens. (Hegel might object that the word ‘horse’
is unitary, and presents the horse as unitary, unlike the composite definition: see e.g. Enc. III,
¶462 on the name, e.g.          ‘lion’.) However,       ‘God is love’     is obviously not a definition of this
type. It is closer to what Charles L. Stevenson called a ‘persuasive definition’, where the word
defined retains its evaluative quality but acquires a different denotation.                       ‘God’   characteris-
tically has a high evaluative quality in virtue of its core meaning, say,                       ‘the supreme being
responsible for the creation of the universe’. ‘Love’ has a high evaluative quality too, but not
so high as ‘God’, since it competes for supremacy with other words, such as ‘morality’,
‘happiness’, etc. So ‘love’ cannot supplant              ‘God’, unless we radically alter its meaning. The
definition of ‘horse’ is generally accepted and is unlikely to be revised. The definition of
‘God’ is contested and historically evolving. Moreover, the definitions of God that Hegel
presents are mutually compatible. Someone might say that God is all these things—the
eternal, the moral world-order, and love. What then? We cannot plausibly replace ‘God’ by
the expression       ‘the eternal, the moral world-order, and love’. The conjunction of these
concepts is baffling unless they are all epithets of a single entity, namely God. This is where
Hegel’s own response to the eliminability of                 ‘God’   comes in. If     ‘God’    is eliminated, it will
look as if what is ‘posited’        is ‘a Being’    (ein Sein) or a sort of being, ‘essence’           or ‘universal’,
that is, a property or set of properties, an abstract entity rather than a real entity. But Hegel,
or at least his targets, believe that God is a real entity, a bearer of properties, not simply
properties. He is not simply eternity, moral world-order, or love, but                            something that is
eternal and/or moral world-order and/or love. Even if God is ultimately identical with his
attributes in the way that Aquinas proposed, he is not flatly identical with his properties, so
as to exclude any distinction between God and his properties. He is, that is,                         ‘reflected into’
himself as a subject. However, he does not, as he is presented here, reflect                             himself into
himself. God is static and passive; all his predicates (‘eternal’, etc.) are applied to him by us.
If we say ‘God is eternal’, and then ‘God is loving’, the order in which these propositions are
advanced does not match any corresponding order in God himself. When, by contrast, we
say of a human being: ‘It is an embryo; then a foetus; then an infant; . . . ; and then a rational
adult’, our propositions match the order in which the human being itself develops,                               finally
---

   becoming explicitly what it had to be implicitly all along in order to power this develop-
   ment, namely a subject. God may not develop over time, but there is at least logical order of
   his development, analogous to the development of a human from embryo to rational adult.
   Hegel requires God to be presented in this logical order. When the supposed predicates are
   presented in their intrinsic logical order, God’s unity as a subject is attained without the
   need for a grammatical subject,              ‘God’, to hold them all together. Theology is converted
   into logic.
¶24. 1. To present the development of something in its logical order and, where relevant, in its
   temporal order is        ‘science’   (Wissenschaft) or       ‘system’. There may be ‘knowledge’ (Wissen)
   that is not scientific or systematic, either of things that lack any system (e.g. heraldic devices:
   Enc. I, ¶16) or of things that do, such as God. But this knowledge is not                          ‘actual’, not fully
   developed knowledge. This             ‘flows from’    what Hegel has already said: the absolute needs to
   be tracked in its logical development. That a ‘basic proposition’                    (Grundsatz) is, taken on its
   own,    ‘false’, at least in the sense that it is not yet ‘actual’              knowledge, also seems to flow
   therefrom. But the claim is ambiguous. Such axiomatized systems as Spinoza’s                              Ethics or of
   Euclidean geometry illustrate a part of Hegel’s case. They are systematic and ‘scientific’,
   rather than random collections of thoughts. Moreover, it is not enough to state the axioms
   (and definitions) on their own. We have to derive theorems from them. The significance of
   the axioms does not become clear to us until we know what can be derived from them.
   However, the systems that Hegel has in mind differ from these in two respects. First, in
   Spinoza’s and Euclid’s systems there are several axioms and also several definitions. This
   impairs their scientific, systematic character. What is the relationship between the several
   axioms? In what order should we present them? If one of the axioms is selected as the                              first,
   then that is really the       first principle of the system, which now has only one basic principle.
   The sort of system that Hegel has in mind has only one first principle: ‘Our task is to
   discover the primordial, absolutely unconditioned first principle of all human knowledge.
   This can be neither proved nor defined, if it is to be an absolutely primary principle’                        (Fichte,
   1993, p.18). Secondly, in Spinoza’s and Euclid’s systems, the axioms and definitions are
   never retracted, modified or ‘refuted’: they persist unchallenged throughout the course of
   the system. All that happens is that theorems are derived from the axioms, which no doubt
   shows that the axioms on their own are incomplete, but does not impair them in any other
   respect. In the systems that Hegel is thinking of, by contrast, the first principle is modified or
   restricted by what succeeds it. Fichte’s system begins with the pure I or ego. The                                  first
   principle expressing this is the law of identity,              ‘A=A’, which soon becomes              ‘I=I’. (Fichte is
   trying to base traditional logic on transcendental philosophy.) The next step is the intro-
   duction of the non-I, by way of the equally ‘unconditioned’                     principle ‘Non-A is not A’. But
   this new principle restricts the first: ‘Insofar as the not-self is posited, the Self is not posited;
   for the not-self completely nullifies the Self ’ (ibid.,                p.55). By the first principle the I is
   established (or establishes itself) as the unrestricted lord of the universe, but it has to ‘posit’
   an opponent, and this contracts its domain. The simple models that Hegel has presented
   earlier have a similar structure. In PS ¶2 successive philosophies are related to each other
   like the stages in the growth of a plant, each              ‘refuted’ by its successor. In ¶¶18 and 19, God
   first becomes other than himself, in a way refuting himself, and then recovers himself in the
   world. Here Hegel is primarily referring to the treatment of abstract concepts in his logic.
   But his procedure in the body of PS follows the same pattern. Each shape of consciousness
   (including the opening one, sensory certainty) is supplanted by its successor; it does not
   persist unmodified in the way that a traditional axiom, premise, or theorem does. Hegel’s
   method perhaps bears comparison with Plato’s claim that philosophy proceeds by ‘cancel-
   ling hypotheses’        (Rep. 533c:      tas hupotheseis anairousa). However, he emphasizes three
   points that Plato does not explicitly stress. First, what is wrong with the ‘principle’ is not
---
                                                                                                                

   that it is especially contentious, but that it is ‘universal’, i.e. indeterminate,                     ‘immediate’, i.e.
   not justified or analysed, and an as yet unrealized ‘purpose’. Secondly, the principle is to be
   refuted by developing it, not by bringing in extraneous material; it is to be                              self-refuting.
   Thirdly, because the principle is self-refuting, its refutation is positive as well as negative, an
   enhancement of it as well as a refutation, a                     ‘sublation’. In these respects the principle
   resembles the rough first draft of a book—thin and sketchy, but promising—that is to be
   worked up into, and supplanted by, the                  final version.
¶25. 1. Hegel seems to identify the propositions (i)                  ‘The true is actual only as system’ and (ii)
   ‘Substance is essentially subject’. An initial obstacle to this is that while (ii) implicitly refers
   to the absolute, (i) apparently refers to our knowledge of the absolute. So far Hegel has used
   the word ‘system’ only in the subjective sense, applying it to our knowledge, not to the object
   of our knowledge. But the word ‘system’ also has an objective sense, for any organized
   structure. So perhaps (i) means ‘The true (i.e. the absolute, since ‘true’ here is also used in its
   objective sense) is only actual (i.e. complete) when it develops into a system (i.e.an
   organized structure)’. Then the connection with proposition (ii) is this: if the absolute is
   only substance, it cannot develop into a system; it can only do so if it is also an active,
   purposive subject. However, Hegel may instead, or even                         also, be continuing his subjective
   use of     ‘system’, which also makes decent sense of (ii):                       ‘The true or absolute is only
   completely actualized when it is presented in a system by us, for only then does it fully
   recover itself in its creation.’          This suggests that the          ‘subject’   in (ii) is not only an active
   subject, but also a knowing, system-building subject. This eases the introduction of spirit.
      Here Hegel speaks of            ‘the spiritual’    (das Geistige) as well as of           ‘spirit’ (Geist), perhaps
   because he is discussing the emergence and development of spirit, which begins not from
   fully   fledged spirit, but the spiritual aspect of ordinary life. This is initially embedded in
   substance, rather than free and independent (‘in-and-for-itself ’): it is ‘spiritual substance’
   (geistige Substanz), an expression that recurs in PS ¶¶26 and 36 as well as in chapter
   VI. That     ‘the spiritual alone is the actual’           means that only the spiritual has the power to
   undertake the following process: (1) It is the ‘essence’ or ‘in itself ’, it has an intrinsic nature
   that does not depend on its relationships to other things or, more specifically, on its being
   revealed to itself or to others. (2) It encounters itself in a determinate form, as if it sees itself
   in a mirror. Then it is         ‘interrelating’, it relates itself to what is other than itself. It may not
   recognize     itself in the mirror, but it is nevertheless for itself, no longer merely in itself. (3)
   Now it is both in itself and for itself, that is, it remains                         ‘within itself ’     despite being
   determinate and ‘outside itself ’. We might take this to mean that spirit now recognizes
   itself in its other-being, recognizes itself in the mirror. But the following sentence seems to
   deny this.     We are aware that spirit is in and for itself, and in itself, intrinsically, spirit is in
   and for itself. But spirit itself is not yet aware of this: it does not recognize itself in the
   mirror. Although spiritual, it is unreflective               ‘substance’ rather than subject. (4) Spirit is not
   yet fully self-aware, but ‘must’ become so, must become its own ‘object’, not an object that
   remains distinct from it, but an object that is                ‘sublated’   in virtue of spirit’s recognition of it
   as itself. This happens in the following way: Spirit generates its own content. So when it is
   aware of this content, it is ‘for itself ’, aware of itself. But if it is not aware that it generates its
   own content, it is not aware that it is aware of itself. It is for itself ‘only for us’, who are aware
   that it generates its own content. This is where we left spirit at stage (3). At stage (4),
   however, spirit generates not simply more content of the same sort; it generates or projects
   its own self-generation, namely, the                ‘pure concept’      that enabled it to generate particular
   contents, but which is itself no particular content, but rather the abstract plan underlying
   them. Then spirit knows itself inside out; it has become the equal of                              ‘us’, and begins to
   construct      ‘science’, the      ‘system’    that completes the actualization of the absolute. The
   distinction between the subjective system and the objective system, has been sublated.

   The completion of the subjective system (by Hegel himself) is also the completion of the
   objective system.
¶26. 1.   ‘Pure self-cognition’ is Hegelian logic, into which PS is intended to lead and with which
   Hegel’s system proper begins. It is self-cognition in that what is known by thought is not
   distinct from thought, but the universal thoughts that constitute the essential core of spirit
   or the mind—the ‘pure concept’               of ¶25. ‘In absolute otherness’ refers to the fact that logic
   requires the abandonment of one’s everyday engagement with objects distinct from oneself
   and is like the pure and intangible ‘aether’. Its ‘becoming’ is primarily its gradual emergence
   from everyday consciousness, though also the development within the system of thoughts
   itself. It is    simple    in contrast to nature and mind (or                    ‘spirit’) itself, which involve
   an empirical embodiment, not just pure thoughts. For the same reason it is immediate,
   not mediated by the empirical aspects either of nature or of the concrete mind. Thoughts,
   i.e. concepts, have ‘existence as such’, i.e. independent existence, when we think about and/
   or in terms of them.           ‘Essentiality’    is that which constitutes the essence of something.
   Thoughts or the pure concept constitute the essence of things, both of natural entities
   and especially of the mind itself. It is ‘transfigured’ in the sense of ‘illuminated’, when it
   thinks about itself or is reflected into itself. This reflection is                      ‘simple’, i.e. direct, not
   mediated by any detours through the empirical world, hence a sort of ‘Being’ (Sein): it
   just  is, with no hidden depths.
      The requirement to engage in pure thinking is addressed to ‘self-consciousness’ rather
   than to ‘consciousness’ because consciousness, in Hegel’s sense, is essentially consciousness
   of objects other than itself, and cannot extricate itself from them without ceasing to be
   consciousness. Self-consciousness, by contrast, stands above any particular range of objects
   and can decide which, if any, it will acknowledge and consider. This is why the ‘individual’ is
   entitled to ask why he should adopt the philosophical standpoint and how he can do so.
   Hegel’s answer is to provide a ‘ladder’, an account of the way in which one might ascend by
   easy stages from one’s present              ‘standpoint’, whatever that may be, to the philosophical
   standpoint. One can ascend or descend an ordinary ladder as one pleases or stay on any
   particular rung: the ladder enables one to ascend if one wants to, but it does not oblige one
   to ascend it or even provide a reason for doing so. Hegel’s ladder too does not oblige one to
   ascend: not everyone need be a philosopher. But it does at each stage give one a reason to
   ascend to the next stage, owing to some problem at each stage that one will discover if one
   thinks hard enough and that one can resolve only by going up a stage. Hence one’s ascent up
   the ladder does not require on one’s part a desire to reach the philosophical standpoint.
   Once one is on the ladder, one has reason to continue one’s ascent. But what motivates
   someone to get onto the ladder in the               first place? Or to think hard enough at each stage to
   find the problem in it? That can only be one’s desire to reach the top of the ladder, either
   because one wants to reach the philosophical standpoint or a least to satisfy one’s curiosity
   about the view from the top.
      There is, however, a difficulty. Self-consciousness is also generally consciousness. As well
   as being aware of itself, it is also aware of a range of objects distinct from itself. In fact, at
   most of the stages of Hegel’s ladder, we are conscious of objects distinct from ourselves.
   Because of its self-awareness and its relative independence of its objects, self-consciousness
   can envisage the philosophical standpoint and ask for a ladder up to it. But because of its
   usual dependence on objects, its ascent to the philosophical standpoint involves a reversal.
   In science or at least its first phase, logic, the individual does not deal with objects distinct
   from the mind itself, but with the thoughts that form the core of the mind. Nor does science
   accommodate the self-conscious individual. Within the realm of pure thought the individ-
   ual cannot refer to himself as a particular individual; the individual is wholly absorbed in the
   thoughts that he thinks about; the view he is obliged to adopt, even when he emerges from

                                                                                                   

    logic, is the view from nowhere. Hegel thus speaks of science as an apparent ‘inversion’ of
    ‘immediate self-consciousness’. (In 1802, Hegel had said that in relation to sound common
    sense, the world of philosophy is an inverted world: cf. ¶69.) Inversion is a recurrent theme
    in PS. But here Hegel hardly establishes a strict inversion. In natural consciousness the
    conscious Self is opposed to its objects. In a strict inversion the Self and its objects would
    switch sides, the Self becoming the object and the object becoming the Self. But whatever
    this might mean, it is not what happens when we turn to science. Rather the opposition
    between the Self and its object fades away as the two sides converge. Nevertheless, science
    and self-consciousness are at odds with one another. But science needs self-conscious
    individuals to develop it. Otherwise it remains the ‘in-itself ’: the thoughts remain implicit
    in the mind (and also in our unscientific activity and discourse) but not considered for
    themselves, ‘spiritual substance’, but not yet spirit; hence the need for a ladder.
¶27. 1.   ‘Sensory consciousness’ is here equivalent to ‘sensory certainty’, Hegel’s usual expres-
    sion for the first ‘shape’ of consciousness, which is ‘immediate’ both because it is not derived
    from any more primitive stage of spirit and because it is putatively not mediated by thoughts
    or concepts. It is not identical with the             ‘natural consciousness’ described in ¶26: Hegel’s
    readers are more advanced, having conceptual resources not available to sensory conscious-
    ness. The ‘element [i.e. the domain] of science’ is its ‘pure concept’, not science as such, since
    it is not yet developed.
       ‘Foundation’ (Begründung) is ambiguous: it could mean the ‘establishment’ of science, or
    the ‘justification’ of science. Probably, it here means the latter. A foundation in this sense,
    involving, say, axioms and definitions from which theorems are deduced, is clearly different
    from an introduction for the uninitiated, who may well understand some of the theorems
    better than the axioms. It is not clear what Hegel’s readers would expect of an ‘introduction’
    (Anleitung) to science. Perhaps it would a simplified summary, of the sort that Hegel
    presented to his high-school pupils in Nuremberg. Hegel’s PS is different from both these
    enterprises, though it has something in common with each. It bears comparison with
    Descartes’s introduction to his mathematico-physical world-view in his Meditations on
    First Philosophy. At all events it is quite different from the pistol-shot method and its
    contempt for other views. Hegel is less like, say, Bentham, who regards opposing views as
    ‘nonsense on stilts’ than J.S. Mill, who tried to reconcile and incorporate the opposing views
    of Bentham and Coleridge.
¶28. 1. A connection is drawn between the education of an individual and the education of the
    human race. (Cf. G.E. Lessing,             The Education of the Human Race, 1780.) Humanity is
    conceived as ‘the universal individual, self-conscious spirit’. (The first, 1807, edition of PS
    had ‘the universal individual, the world-spirit’, which probably expresses Hegel’s meaning
    more explicitly.) The universal individual is introduced surreptitiously. We are to see the
    education of the individual ‘in its universal sense’. That looks as if it means that we are not
    concerned only with the education of some definite particular individual, but with the
    education of any and every individual. But any and every individual is a definite, particular
    individual, not a universal individual. But Hegel’s point is clear enough: human culture
    varies over time, and in fact advances, so that the culture of a later epoch is in general
    superior to that of an earlier epoch. Humanity undergoes what we might call its ‘primary
    education’. So too a particular individual goes through various stages of education and in
    general a later stage is superior to an earlier stage. Moreover, any particular individual
    belongs to some stage or other of the universal individual. Thus an early 19th-century
    German belongs to a fairly high stage of the universal individual, with all the wealth of
    German religion, philosophy, etc. available to him. However, this predominantly German
    individual also contains the earlier stages of the universal individual—Egyptian, Greek,
    Roman, medieval—‘in blurred outline’. The particular individual undergoes a ‘secondary

    education’     into German culture. It is introduced successively to the stages through which
    the universal individual has passed in roughly the order in which they occurred over
    historical time. This ‘past Being-there’            of the universal individual constitutes the ‘inorganic
    nature’   of the child only in the sense that it is present in the child’s parents and its social
    environment. It is not yet present in the infant itself, which does not differ intrinsically from
    an infant belonging to any previous stage of human culture. It appears to it ‘externally’. But
    Hegel also has in mind the            ‘tertiary education’       whereby an educated adult reading PS or
    attending Hegel’s lectures         ‘revives the recollection’ of the stages of his own past education
    and therefore the past stages of the universal individual that he absorbed in his primary
    education. These two types of education are easily confused, since Hegel’s readers are
    completing their primary education as well as receiving a secondary education: they are
    learning about ‘science’, an aspect of the universal individual or spirit, for the first time, as well
    as retrieving their past education. It is not clear why the particular individual is the ‘incom-
    plete spirit’. That it is dominated by ‘one determinacy’, if this means that it is dominated by
    one culture (such as 19th-century German culture), is also true of the universal individual, at
    least in the sense that in the 19th century it is dominated by 19th-century culture, containing
    other, earlier, cultures only in ‘blurred outline’. Perhaps Hegel is ignoring the temporal devel-
    opment of the universal individual and supposing that all its stages are present in it in equal
    intensity. Or perhaps he is noting that no particular individual ever absorbs the whole culture
    of his age, so that he falls short of the stage of the universal individual to which he belongs.
       The parallelism between (1) the primary education of the universal individual or spirit, (2)
    the secondary education of a particular individual, and (3) the tertiary education of a
    particular individual, is overstretched. If there were a close parallel between (1) and (2),
    then a 19th-century German child would learn, say, the Chinese and Egyptian languages and
    religions before learning German. If there were a close parallel between (1) and (3), then PS
    would not begin with sensory certainty, for, as Hegel later learnt from Wilhelm von Hum-
    boldt, ‘it seems that the language of the most civilized peoples has the less complete grammar,
    and the same language has a more complete grammar when the people is in a more
    uncivilized state than in a more highly civilized state’                   (Enc. III, ¶459). Moreover, Hegel
    shows no sign of believing, even in 1806, that sensory certainty was the dominant shape of
    consciousness of some early culture. In fact, PS does not present a single, continuous
    historical narrative. Some chapters are not significantly historical: I, II, III, and V. Others
    are historical, but they present not one historical sequence, but three: from the state of nature
    to medieval Christianity (IV), from the Greek city-state to the French revolution and its
    aftermath (VI), and from ancient Persia to Lutheran Christianity (VII). The order in which
    shapes of consciousness are presented is primarily logical; only occasionally does this
    coincide with the real historical order.
       Here as before        ‘substance’    is contrasted with         ‘self-consciousness’        and   ‘reflection into
    itself ’ and implicitly with       ‘subject’. But ‘substance’        has now lost its Spinozist connotation
    and has become the evolving culture of humanity.
       On ‘acquired property’ see ¶29.
¶29. 1. As in ¶28, we need to distinguish between (1) the primary education of the universal
    individual or the world-spirit; (2) the secondary education of a particular individual into his
    own culture; and (3) the tertiary education of Hegel’s students. Each of them presupposes
    the occurrence of its predecessor:

    (1) Both the occurrence of primary education and the sequence of its stages are necessary.
         When a given stage of it, e.g. the Roman Empire, is immediately present, it is not ‘in
         itself ’: it is not merely potential and implicit, but actual and explicit; it is also intertwined
         with other events and encumbered by details. It awaits conversion into ‘the form of
---
                                                                                                              

          Being-in-itself ’ by thought and memory—both in later stages of primary education and
          perhaps in secondary education. Primary education requires much time and labour.
    (2) Hegel says little about secondary education here, but it is clear that it must, with few
          exceptions, occur and that it must follow a certain sequence. It too requires time and
          labour, but far less than primary education.
    (3) Tertiary education need not follow the fixed sequence of (1) and (2). One can, e.g., study
          Rome before going back to Greece. But one must follow the historical sequence if the goal of
          this education is to be attained. In ¶28 a culturally advanced individual revived snippets of
          his past education without dwelling on them. Now we have to dwell on each stage or
          ‘moment’, regarding it as a comprehensive way of viewing the world and viewing the world
          itself through its lenses. This is less troublesome than (1) and (2). The Roman Empire,
          e.g., has already been subjected to thought, converted into an in-itself, and recollected—
          especially by unphilosophical historians. As in ¶28, when something has receded into the
          past and become an object of thought rather than occurrent, it becomes the ‘property’ or
          possession of      ‘substance’    or  ‘universal spirit’. All we have to do now is convert this
          preprocessed event into the form of Being-for itself, to restore to the event something like
          the living vitality it had on its original occurrence, re-establishing its relations to other
          events, etc: cf. ¶30. The overall goal of this education is to attain ‘insight into what knowledge
          is’. In ¶83 to investigate the ‘truth’ of knowledge, i.e. of what we classify as knowledge, is to
          investigate what knowledge is ‘in itself ’. It is to reach a synoptic view of human knowledge,
          together with its truth-status and logical underpinnings. At the end, knowledge circles back
          on itself, becoming knowledge of knowledge, not just knowledge of other things. From a
          theological point of view, the attainment of this meta-knowledge is not only the goal of tertiary
          education, but also of primary education. It is the goal of the world-spirit.

¶30. 1. An event, culture, etc. goes through three stages: (i) It occurs as concrete reality or
    ‘Being-there’. Hegel does not need to                 ‘sublate’   this Being-there. That has already been
    done for us, at least by the passage of time. (ii) By a ‘negation’                     of it, Being-there is taken
    back into the substance, and turned into a                   ‘representation’ or conception of the ‘Self ’.
    This occurs      ‘immediately’: the representation portrays, say, the Roman Empire just as it
    occurred, with no conceptual structuring or refinement. We are                           finished and done with
    the Roman Empire; we are familiar with it, though we do not have knowledge of it.
    Familiarity is the business of the ‘particular’, uncomprehending Self, the everyday Self
    that concentrates on the present and insofar as it thinks about the past at all, thinks
    about it from its own point of view. (iii) Knowledge and thinking are the province of the
    ‘universal Self ’, which, by a second                ‘negation’, transforms the representation into a
    thought. The universal Self is not the same as the world-spirit, the substance of the
    individual, the universal individual, or the universal spirit of ¶¶28 and 29. The latter are
    collective or communal rather than individual, whereas the universal Self is the individual
    Self operating at a universal and impersonal level. The particular Self produces particular
    speech performances (parole), as it were, while the universal Self has the underlying
    linguistic competence (langue).
       These three stages correspond to the three stages of ¶29: (1) the actual occurrent event;
    (2) its conversion into the in-itself by the advance of the world-spirit; and (3) the
    prospective conversion of this in-itself into Being-for-itself. However, stage (ii) of ¶30
    is described differently from stage (2) of ¶29. At stage (2) of ¶29 the past Being-there is
    ‘thought’    (Gedachtes), while at stage (ii) of ¶30 it has passed into ‘representation’, which
    is explicitly contrasted with          ‘thinking’.    ‘Thinking’     and ‘thought’      are used in two ways. In
    ¶29 they contrast primarily with              ‘actuality’   and ‘Being-there’, while in ¶30 they contrast
    with other mental operations, especially the more pictorial ‘representation’. Moreover, in
---
      

    ¶29, stage (2) focuses on the appropriation of the past by the communal                                  ‘substance’,
    while in ¶30 stage (ii)focuses on the appropriation of the past by the individual ‘Self ’. It
    would be less appropriate to attribute subjective ‘representation’ to substance. Nevertheless
    Hegel clearly exaggerates in implying that the individual Self simply reproduces the past
    pictorially. Whereas in ¶29 he was trying to minimize the difficulty that his readers face by
    stressing the preparatory work already done for them, in ¶30 he is stressing how much more
    remains to be done.
¶31. 1. Hegel establishes a link between familiarity and ‘representation’, which he regularly
    contrasts with conceptual thought.               ‘Familiar’    and    ‘well-known’       both translate      bekannt,
    while ‘known’ is erkannt; I have sacrificed the distinction between wissen (‘know, -ledge’)
    and erkennen (‘(re)cognize’, ‘(re)cognition’) to reproduce Hegel’s pun. Hegel’s complaint
    resembles Plato’s criticism of mathematics, in Republic 510d2–3, for relying on unexamined
    ‘hypotheses’ such as the odd and the even, etc. The complaint would also extend to the
    characters in Plato’s early dialogues, who speak about virtue, etc. but do not, until prodded
    by Socrates, ask ‘What is virtue?’             Yovel (2005), p.126, identifies Fichte as Hegel’s main
    target, but since the failing is ‘common’, it is unlikely that Hegel has any particular person in
    his sights. What is familiar is a concept,              ‘subject and object’, etc. What it requires is not
    ‘apprehending and testing’, by checking one’s own intuitions against those of others, but
    conceptual analysis: cf. ¶32 and Enc. I, ¶¶19, 63.
¶32. 1.    Analysieren      comes from the Greek            analuein,     ‘to break up, dissolve’. Hence Hegel
    associates it with death. (See also             Enc. I, ¶38 Addition, which associates analysis with
    empiricism, and Enc. I, ¶¶227–31.) There are three stages: (1) The concrete substance or
    the familiar representation of it, the self-enclosed ‘circle’. This is ‘abstract immediacy, etc.’; it
    is just there and involves no relevant mediation or negation. (2) The subject, or the
    understanding, dismembers this substance by extracting its accidents one by one and giving
    them a new, independent life ‘in its own element’, i.e. in thought and the Self. (3) The
    subject reconstitutes substance, now a ‘genuine’ substance. It is still appropriately described
    as  ‘Being’ (Sein) and ‘immediacy’, since it is there before us quite apart from the mediating
    process that gave rise to it, having incorporated this process into itself.
       The constituents or moments into which the substance is dismembered are static or dead,
    taken on their own. But together they produce the movement in (3), rather as (Hegel
    explains in SL, p.82) the force applied to a lever and its distance from the fulcrum lifts a
    weight that neither could lift on its own. This is what happens to the shapes of conscious-
    ness that Hegel examines. One shape collapses and gives way to another because it consists
    of different moments that enter into conflict with each other. Romantics such as Novalis
    were averse to the analysing understanding, believing it to dissolve the beauty of concrete
    wholes. This is ‘beauty without force’. But another sort of beauty can reconstruct itself from
    the fragments left by the understanding.
       Hegel says both that ‘the concrete . . . divides itself ’ and               that such ‘division’      is the work
    of the    ‘understanding’. This stems from his tendency to objectify what are primarily
    subjective, mental, or logical, concepts, treating them as intrinsic to things as well as to our
    thought. He perhaps thinks of the analytical ‘understanding’ as at work in things them-
    selves. The transition from subjective to objective understanding is eased by the fact that
    his primary objects of analysis are shapes of consciousness, which do, in his view, analyse
    and refute themselves. However, death and ‘freedom’                     suggest that he also had in mind the
    French revolution. There the three stages are: (1) the                        ancien regime, a self-enclosed
    substance; (2) its disintegration into separate, liberated individuals, facing death in the
    terror; and (3) the (prospective) restoration of order that restrains, while yet acknowledging,
    individual liberty: see PS ¶¶582ff., esp. ¶590: ‘The sole work and deed of universal freedom is
    therefore death.’

¶33. 1. It is unclear whether Hegel means that what is represented becomes ‘property’ of self-
    consciousness just in virtue of our having a representation of it or that it becomes its
    property owing to the analysis described in ¶32. But either way there are now four stages of
    education: (1) ‘sensory immediacy’; (2) representations; (3) ‘fixed thoughts’; and (4) fluid
    thoughts or ‘concepts’. The transition from (1) to (2) does not concern Hegel here: both
    ancients and moderns acquire sensory, but universal representations, in the same way. The
    difference between ‘antiquity’ (primarily Athens and, in particular, Socrates) and modernity
    is that the ancient had to develop thoughts from (1)/(2). This eased the transition from (3),
    fixed thoughts, to (4), fluid thoughts. By contrast, the modern is presented with thoughts
    prefabricated by past philosophers. This hampers the transition from (3) to (4). The ancient,
    since he starts from scratch, lacks the firm, self-aware ego that we have inherited from
    Descartes. He develops his conception of himself along with his development of universal
    thoughts. So he can follow the thoughts where they lead, with no resistance from the ego.
    The modern, by contrast, already has a                  firmly developed ego by the time he receives
    universal thoughts; in fact the thought of the I, in contrast to its content, is one of the
    thoughts he has received. This I is              ‘fixed’. It does not change or develop as it acquires
    new thoughts, but remains opposed to and unaffected by the thoughts it thinks. The
    thoughts tend to be as fixed as the I that thinks them: they derive unconditionality from
    the I, and become unconditional themselves, i.e. independent of each other and even,
    perhaps, of the I itself. A fixed I cannot have fluid thoughts. Thoughts are                       fluid only if the
    I or ‘pure thinking’ engages with them and does not just view them from the sidelines. Then
    it sees itself as a     ‘moment’      in the development of thoughts. It develops along with the
    thoughts, changing throughout the course of PS.
       ‘Essence’ is Wesen and ‘essentiality’ is Wesenheit, i.e. that which constitutes the essence of
    something. Here Hegel is thinking of the Logic rather than PS itself. SL equates essentialities
    with ‘determinations of reflection’, i.e. pairs of concepts that are ‘reflected’ into each other
    and thus constitute each other, such as identity/difference, positive/negative, subject/object.
    These concepts are ‘circles’, since each of the pair directs us to the other, which then returns
    us to the first again. Essentialities are more prominent in the second part of the Logic, the
    ‘Doctrine of Essence’, but similar relations between thoughts obtain in the rest of the Logic.
¶34. 1. Hegel regards an ‘organic whole’ as consisting of organs each of which depends on the
    operation of the others, and none of which can be subtracted without undermining the
    whole. Thus, the brain requires the heart to supply blood to it, but conversely the heart
    requires the brain to regulate its beating. If we consider the heart, this directs us to the brain,
    liver, kidneys, etc., and each of these directs us back to the heart and the other organs. The
    whole organism is governed by its ‘concept’, the plan embodied in the seed. In Hegel’s
    system thoughts are similarly interconnected. If we explore the implications of any one
    thought, we end up with a complete system of thoughts governed by a single concept that
    emerges at the end. This is the ‘concept of knowledge’, the master plan that generates and
    governs all our knowledge. One difference between a natural organism and Hegel’s thought-
    system is this. If I am considering, say, the human body, there is no obvious uniquely
    appropriate starting-point and no obvious uniquely appropriate continuation. I may start
    with the brain and proceed to the heart, or start with the stomach and proceed to the brain.
    (But cf. Enc. II, ¶¶350ff., where Hegel’s account of an animal organism proceeds in what
    he regards as a non-arbitrary, even necessary, order.) In the case of thoughts, by contrast,
    there is, in Hegel’s view, a uniquely appropriate starting-point and a uniquely appropriate
    continuation. In fact, Hegel claims that it is not                  we, Hegel and his readers, who move
    through the thoughts; rather the thoughts or the concept move of their own accord and ‘we’
    simply follow their movement. Here Hegel is influenced by a different though complemen-
    tary account of an organism: that in its growth it develops from relative simplicity to relative
---

    complexity until finally the whole organism is complete: cf. ¶2. Thus PS begins with sensory
    certainty, the simplest shape of consciousness, and the Logic begins with Being, the simplest
    of all thoughts. As in the case of a living organism, the system develops in a fixed order and
    must pass through all the stages prescribed by the ‘concept’.
       The references to         ‘consciousness’       suggest that Hegel is here speaking about PS in
    particular, whereas        ‘pure essentialities’      belong more properly to Logic. He believes that
    logical thoughts underlie everything else, including the shapes of consciousness. Hence the
    sequence of shapes of consciousness is determined by and mirrors that of the pure
    essentialities. The ‘worldliness’          of consciousness contrasts it with pure thinking or logic:
    consciousness apprehends the world, whereas logic deals only with pure thoughts. There is
    also a claim of completeness: PS will cover all the shapes of consciousness.
       ‘Determinate’      thoughts here contrast with ‘fluid’ thoughts. ‘Contingent’                     philosophizing
    makes do with ‘fixed’ thoughts; with fluid thoughts we can dispense with it.
¶35. 1. PS is a ‘preparation’ for science (¶34), but because it is systematic, and underpinned by
    logic, also a part of science. But Hegel’s claim that PS is the                          first  part of science is
    questionable. When Hegel presents the fundamental outline of his system in Enc., he begins
    with Logic, and ‘phenomenology’               comes later, in Enc. III, ¶¶413–39. He there presents his
    system as circular, even as a             ‘circle of circles’, implying that there is no fixed, unique
    beginning; this is less explicit in PS than in Enc., but there are hints of it in PS ¶¶18 and
    802. Logic and nature can claim priority over spirit: nature is simpler, while logical thoughts
    underpin both nature and spirit. According to Enc. III, consciousness is not the ‘outset’ of
    spirit: there are more primitive phases of spirit, such as that of the embryo or the infant,
    which do not involve consciousness in Hegel’s sense. That spirit does not in PS ‘return into
    itself ’ is neither obviously true nor obviously relevant: the idea of spirit’s returning into itself
    is not clear enough to disqualify its attainment of the ‘concept of knowledge’ (¶34) by the
    end of PS and, even if it is true, it shows only that PS is not the final part of science, not that
    it is the    first part. Hegel’s best reason for beginning with PS is that it makes a better
    introduction to his system, not because it is logically prior to other parts, but because its
    content is more familiar. Hegel’s procedure is comparable to Descartes’s. In one sense,
    Descartes’s system begins with the cogito, the firm foundation on which he erects his edifice.
    However, to see Descartes’s motivation for adopting the cogito as his starting-point, the tyro
    needs to be guided along the very route by which he arrived at the cogito, the successively
    more acute and wider-ranging sceptical doubts that preceded it; a starting-point presup-
    poses an account of one’s reasons for adopting it. But Hegel hankers for an all-embracing
    system, leaving no loose ends or beginnings, and incorporating any informal introduction to it.
¶36. 1. In Hegel’s usage one is always conscious                    of  something, never simply conscious (as
    when one loses, recovers, or returns to consciousness). What one is conscious of is an
    ‘object’,  Gegenstand, ‘what stands [stand] against [gegen]’, and is thus an intentional object,
    the object or focus of some mental state or attitude. Correspondingly,                                ‘objectivity’  is
    Gegenständlichkeit. Objectivity is ‘negative’ to knowledge, in that while neither can occur
    without the other, they are distinct from each other, as are, say, the poles of a magnet or wife
    and husband: see also ¶37.
       On ‘moments’, cf. ¶32. The moments that spirit ‘unfolds’ are not the same as the moments
    of consciousness, viz. knowledge and objectivity. They are rather the stages of spirit’s
    development, while knowledge and objectivity are the                        ‘opposition’     that inheres in each
    stage. Hegel’s argument is: spirit unfolds its spirit-moments in consciousness, so the
    opposition involved in consciousness-moments inheres in every spirit-moment and every
    spirit-moment becomes a ‘shape’ or form of consciousness.
       On substance and its          ‘movement’, cf. ¶18; on ‘spiritual substance’, cf. ¶26. Substance
    moves, in virtue of being             ‘subject’    as well as substance. But there is not invariably

    consciousness of substance and its movement. The development of logic, for example, does
    not involve consciousness in Hegel’s sense, since it is thought about thought, not about an
    object distinct from itself. Again, the (non-temporal) development of nature does not
    involve consciousness, nor do the early stages of the development of the human mind.
    When consciousness does surface, why does it have in its experience only                               spiritual sub-
    stance? Why not also sticks and stones? Hegel’s argument is: insofar as we are conscious of
    substance, this must be because substance itself bifurcates into consciousness and its object:
    cf. ¶¶16, 18, 19. We cannot reasonably suppose that consciousness comes to substance from
    outside. So substance must be its own object. But if substance can bifurcate in this way, it
    must be ‘spiritual’.
       It is unclear what is involved in spirit’s becoming other to itself and sublating its
    otherness. There are several possibilities: (1) Consciousness itself involves both becoming
    other than oneself and a simultaneous sublation of this otherness, since an object of one’s
    consciousness must be both other than oneself, yet also within one’s consciousness and so,
    to that extent, not other than oneself. (2) The final sentence implies a 3-stage process: (i) the
    immediate that is ‘not experienced’; (ii) its ‘alienation’; and (iii) its return from alienation. It
    is tempting to take ‘not experienced’               to mean      ‘not an object of consciousness’, and the
    alienation as the bifurcation of the immediate into itself and consciousness of it—as, say, a
    sleeper awakes to feel a pain that he would have felt earlier, if he had been awake, the pain
    being dormant until he awoke. Then stage (iii) is the actual consciousness of the object and
    this alone reveals the object in its         ‘actuality’, etc. This interpretation is, then, similar to (1).
    However,      ‘what is not experienced’ (das Unerfahrene) probably does not mean ‘what one is
    not conscious of ’. Erfahren, ‘to experience’ comes from fahren, ‘to fare, go, journey, etc.’,
    and its root meaning is ‘to set out on a journey to explore or get to know something’. If
    Hegel uses erfahren in this sense, then the ‘immediate’, our starting-point, is not experi-
    enced, not a part of our journey, even if we are conscious of it. Our experience is rather what
    we make of this starting-point. As we proceed on our journey, this immediate becomes
    alienated, i.e. a problem arises in our consciousness of it, but then the problem is resolved
    and we see the immediate as it really is. Then it becomes the ‘property’, i.e. possession or
    belonging of consciousness. Something like his happens with every ‘shape of consciousness’
    in PS. (3) The movement from immediate to alienation and then return from alienation
    might be located in a longer stretch of PS rather than in a single shape of consciousness.
    Yovel (2005), p.135, interprets the penultimate sentence as follows: in the                                first three
    chapters of PS (‘A. Consciousness’) spirit becomes                     ‘other to’, i.e.    ‘object of ’ itself. This
    otherness is sublated in chapter IV (‘B. Self-consciousness’), when                            ‘as its own object,
    consciousness has its other within itself and is the overcoming of that otherness’. Alterna-
    tively, we might locate spirit’s return from alienation at the end of PS (‘Absolute Knowledge’),
    where spirit ceases to be consciousness and begins to think exclusively about its own thoughts.
    It is this culmination of PS that is described in ¶37. Whether this tells in favour or against a
    similar interpretation of ¶36 depends on how likely it is that ¶37 expands the point made in
    ¶36 or makes a different point.
       An initial problem is whether the penultimate sentence and the final sentence describe the
    same movement. Hegel says they do. If so, (2) or (3) look better than (1)—because of the
    sequence—though Hegel may also have (1) in mind, since he is trying to answer two
    questions: ‘How does spirit become conscious at all?’ and ‘What does spirit do given that
    it is conscious?’
¶37. 1. The ancients are the Greek atomists, especially Democritus and Epicurus, who believed
    that motion would be impossible without a void for atoms to move in, i.e. that the void is a
    necessary, though not a sufficient, condition of motion. This doctrine is hardly relevant to
    Hegel’s theme.

      2. On the      ‘negative’, cf. ¶¶32 and 33 on the negativity of the I, and ¶36, where, however,
    ‘objectivity’   is negative to ‘knowledge’. It is not clear whether the                   ‘negative’   is the I or the
    distinction between the I and its object. Perhaps it is both. The I and the object are each
    distinct from, and therefore negative to, the other. It is in virtue of this distinction that they
    both move or develop. But the I is negative in a special way, and is thus the prime mover,
    though it needs an object to work on. (The artist is distinct from the canvas, so each negates
    the other. But it is the artist who decides what will go on the canvas and who paints over or
    ‘negates’   early drafts.) ‘Disparity’       (Ungleichheit) is ambiguous. It could mean that the I and
    its object are numerically distinct (as are Tweedledum and Tweedledee), that they are unlike
    each other (as are the artist and the painting), or that they are out of accord with each other
    (as are the artist and the painting that does not satisfy him). Hegel probably has all three
    senses in mind. Development is unlikely to occur unless there is some sort of mismatch
    between the I and its object. An artist who is entirely satisfied with the painting does not
    alter it.
       ‘Substance’    is the absolute, the rock-bottom reality. The I that is conscious of substance
    seems initially to be quite distinct from substance. But this, Hegel believes, is incoherent.
    The conscious I must itself be an offshoot of ultimate reality: cf. ¶17. Thus when the I is
    conscious of substance, this must be because substance is conscious of itself. So substance is
    also ‘subject’, not simply in the sense that it is active, but also in the sense that it is conscious,
    etc: cf. ¶17. Throughout most of PS, consciousness, and indeed                         ‘we’   (Hegel’s readers) are
    unaware of this. So the         ‘essence’    of  ‘spirit’ (viz. of substance now conceived as a subject),
    which is that it is its own object, is not in accord with its                ‘Being-there’, i.e. with the various
    shapes of consciousness of it, in which substance looks quite distinct from consciousness.
    But as we reach the end of PS it becomes apparent to consciousness itself that substance is
    its own object, because it becomes its own object                     ‘just as it is’, i.e. manifestly. Then the
    ‘immediacy’      of consciousness’s objects, their sheer givenness, and the gulf between know-
    ledge and its object, truth, is overcome. What Hegel has in mind is that consciousness of
    objects has culminated in logic, thought about thoughts, where ‘Being’, i.e. the object, is no
    longer simply given and apparently independent of the I, immediate, but is excavated from
    the I itself and therefore            ‘mediated’      by the I—‘absolutely’, with no residual core of
    immediacy—yet nevertheless immediately in the I’s possession in a way in which its
    previous objects were not.
       ‘Selfish’ translates     selbstisch,  ‘pertaining to the Self ’, but with little, if any, suggestion of
    egotism.
       ‘The concept’ is the integrated system of pure (i.e. non-empirical) thoughts that form the
    core of the mind and that also structure the world. It is the cosmic version of the concept
    embedded in an acorn that controls the growth and structure of the oak tree: cf. ¶12, etc.
       Traditionally ‘speculative’        amounts to ‘theoretical’, in contrast to ‘practical’. Its force here
    seems to be ‘non-empirical’, in contrast to PS itself. In PS, when spirit is conscious of itself as
    an object, spirit is alienated from itself, but returns to itself once more in Logic: cf. ¶19.
¶38. 1. The ‘system of spirit’s experience’ is presented in PS, while ‘science of the true . . . in the
    shape of the true’ is Logic. What seems negative and false is not so much the transition from
    PS to logic, but the whole advance presented in PS. Kant, like Hegel, believed that the
    method of mathematics is inapplicable to philosophy: see CPR, A713/B741ff. and Broad
    (1941–1942). Kant is, however, arguing against a strong philosophical tradition, including
    Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, and Wolff, that did see mathematics as the appropriate model
    for philosophy.       ‘Unphilosophical knowledge’ refers to a host of lesser philosophers who
    held the same view.
       ‘Appearance’ is Erscheinung. Like Kant (CPR, B69f., A293/B349f.), Hegel distinguishes
    Erscheinung      from Schein,      ‘semblance, illusion’, which implies a clear opposition to reality.

                                                                                                              

    Erscheinung       has most of the senses of ‘appearance’. In ¶13 it amounts to ‘emergence’ or
    ‘coming into existence’, while in ¶76 it occurs both in this sense and in the sense of ‘illusion,
    semblance’ (‘empty appearance’). In ¶38 it seems to combine two senses: (1) the emergence
    or becoming of spirit; and (2) the way or ways in which it appears to consciousness, in
    contrast to its essential nature. Appearances in sense (2) are not wholly at odds with reality,
    but are comparable to, say, the varying aspects of a table that present themselves to me as
    I walk around it, none of which convey its three-dimensional shape but eventually enable
    me to infer it, or to successive conjectures about the shape of the earth (flat, spherical,
    oblate with a bulge at the equator and the north pole, but a depression at the south pole)
    that approximate more and more to its actual shape. ‘Appearance’ is an important word in
    PS, since the word ‘phenomenology’—from the Greek                           phainomai,       ‘appear, be manifest’,
    and logos, ‘account, study, etc.’—means something like the                       ‘doctrine of the appearance(s)
    [of spirit]’.
       Hegel regards negativity and falsity as an essential preliminary to, even an ingredient in,
    the truth. He rejects Descartes’s professed policy of avoiding error at all costs. Errors are
    stepping-stones to truth. For more on ‘true’,                ‘false’, and ‘negative’, see ¶¶39ff.
¶39. 1. Hegel uses         ‘true’ in diverse ways. Sometimes ‘the true’               means     ‘God’   or  ‘rock-bottom
    reality’; then ‘true’ amounts to ‘real’          and has no obvious contrast with ‘false’. Here Hegel is
    using ‘true’    and ‘false’ for the truth-values of propositions or theories. However, he rejects
    the principle of bivalence, whereby there are just two truth-values, truth and falsity, and any
    proposition has one, and only one, truth-value; truth and falsity do not admit of degrees: the
    conjunction of a false proposition and any number of truths is itself plain false. For Hegel,
    by contrast, two (relatively) false philosophies may, when appropriately combined, consti-
    tute a (relatively) true philosophy, and no philosophy can be true unless it combines two or
    more philosophies each of which, taken alone, is false: cf. ¶2.
       ‘Minted coin’      perhaps alludes to Lessing’s           Nathan the Wise         (1779), III.6, where the Jew
    Nathan, when asked by Saladin whether Judaism, Islam, or Christianity is true, reflects that
    truth is not     ‘a new coin, known by the stamp at once’. Nathan (and Lessing) believes that
    none of these religions presents the unvarnished truth and that what matters is not the
    religion itself but the conduct it inspires in its adherents. For Hegel, none of these religions
    is unqualifiedly true, but Christianity is closer to the truth. He rejects Lessing’s exclusively
    moral assessment of religions. But Lessing’s metaphor suits Hegel’s view: truth is not a clear-
    cut, all-or-nothing matter.
       Denial that there is ‘a false’ or ‘an evil’ may amount to (1) the traditional claim that falsity
    and evil are negations or privations, a deficiency or lack of positive truth or positive
    goodness; (2) denial that falsity and evil are individual entities; or (3) denial that any entity
    is purely false or purely evil. (1) entails (2) and (3): if falsity and evil are simply privations,
    then anything purely false or evil would be nothing at all. But (1) is not entailed by (2) and/
    or (3): falsity and evil might be just as positive as truth and goodness, yet not individual
    entities nor capable of pure instances. It is unclear whether Hegel is differentiating falsity
    and evil from truth and goodness or whether the same remarks apply to them. (1) does not
    apply to truth and goodness: they are positive, not privations. As for (2) and (3), he often
    uses    ‘the true’    as if it denoted an entity, viz. the absolute, or something purely and
    exclusively true: cf. ¶¶17 and 39 on substance. But he does deny that anything is purely
    true or purely good: falsity and evil are ingredients, albeit ‘sublated’, in the true and the
    good. At any rate, falsity and evil are            ‘universals’, each with its own distinctive essentiality.
    His failure to mention truth and goodness with respect to (2) and (3) may owe something to
    his conflation of them with (1), which does not apply to truth and goodness.
       If the view that Hegel is attacking were correct, then                   ‘substance’, what we know about,
    would be      ‘the true’, and the false would be the negative of substance. But as we have seen,
---
      

    substance involves its own negation. It presents itself to us in different ways, which are
    negations of each other and also of substance itself. Again, the very fact that it bifurcates into
    the substance known and the knowing Self is also a negation. This in itself might not
    convince us that substance involves falsity. There is, after all, no reason to suppose that all
    negation, even in the sense of privation, amounts to falsity: blindness is a privation, negative
    rather than positive, but it is not falsity. However, one can ‘know falsely’                     ( falsch wissen). In
    German, as in English, this is paradoxical. What Hegel has in mind is not sheer error, but
    ultimately inadequate, preliminary attempts to grasp reality: ‘shapes of consciousness’. The
    knowledge that is in ‘disparity’ or inequality with ‘its substance’ is not piecemeal knowledge
    but knowledge of rock-bottom reality. This cannot be absorbed in one gulp, but only
    gradually by way of         ‘shapes of consciousness’          that capture only fragmentary aspects of it.
    In fact, consciousness as such cannot capture the whole of reality, since it essentially focuses
    on the object and neglects the               ‘subject’, consciousness itself, which is a dimension of
    substance, not an external addition to it: cf. ¶37. Because of its incompleteness, each
    shape of consciousness is inadequate not only to substance as a whole but also intrinsically,
    failing to give a coherent account even of the restricted aspect of substance that it addresses.
    Nevertheless, these shapes are still ‘knowledge’, owing in part to the affinity of                          Wissen    to
    Bewusstsein, ‘consciousness’, and also because it is natural to include the imperfect past
    theories in the ‘advance (or ‘growth’) of scientific (or                ‘human’) knowledge’.
       When does parity emerge? After the collapse of each shape of consciousness a sort of
    parity, albeit temporary, is restored between consciousness and its objects. In each case the
    process by which a result is reached is taken up into the result itself. So the truth, when we
    reach it, absorbs whatever negativity is involved in the preceding process. But global parity,
    parity between knowledge and substance as a whole, is not attained until we reach logic.
    Why is such disparity present               ‘as the Self ’? Two possibilities are: (1) The Self is the
    persistent, innermost core of the truth: cf. ¶22. So the disparity is inherent in the true, not
    external to it. In that case,       ‘as the Self ’  performs a different role from ‘as the negative’: the
    latter characterizes the disparity, the former tells us where it is located. (2) The Self is the
    thinker in contrast to his thoughts. This contrast remains even in Logic. There is disparity
    between thoughts and the thinking about them: the thinker thinks about his own thoughts,
    but the thought that he thinks about is for the most part not the same as his thought about
    it. But if this is what Hegel means, why is this disparity within logic presented as a remnant
    of the disparity within PS? Perhaps his idea is that the Self of logic bears the scars of its
    journey towards logic.
       The transformation undergone by the true and the false when they are combined is
    exemplified by past philosophies integrated into Hegelianism: cf. ¶2. In isolation each
    preceding philosophy is false, if only because it is ‘one-sided’. This type of falsity is remedied
    by its integration into a more comprehensive philosophy. But for this integration a
    philosophy needs further modification or defalsification. Hegel’s own examples illustrate
    his aversion to unmediated opposition. A subject is not properly unified with an object,
    unless the object is seen to be, or to embody, the subject’s own thoughts; an infinite that
    excludes the     finite is  bounded by the finite and therefore not truly infinite; thinking is and
    Being is a thought. Truth and falsity are more like an acid and an alkali than oil and water: a
    salt is a compound of an acid and an alkali, but it would not satisfy a request for an acid and
    an alkali.
¶40. 1.   ‘Dogmatism’        claims that ‘of     two opposed assertions . . . one must be true             and the other
    false’ (Enc. I, ¶32). Greek sceptics contrasted it with ‘scepticism’, suspension of belief. But
    Hegel contrasts it with ‘speculative philosophy’. A dogmatist insists that either (it is true
    that) the soul is     finite  or (it is true that) the soul is infinite; it cannot be both or neither.
    (Dogmatism is similar to bivalence (cf. ¶39), though not identical to it, since dogmatism

    applies to ‘opposed’ propositions rather than a proposition and its negation.) By contrast,
    speculative philosophy says that the soul is both finite and infinite, and that it is neither
    finite nor infinite (Enc. I, ¶32 Addition). Dogmatism is appropriate to many questions.
    Once we specify which Caesar we mean, and which calendar, we can say when he was born.
    Once we specify which stadium we mean (Greek and Roman stadia ranged between 180 and
    200 metres) and which          ‘yard’  (the French toise, which was altered from about 1.949 metres
    to 2 metres in 1799), we can say how many there are in a stadium. But philosophical
    questions cannot be so easily disambiguated.
¶41. 1. As in ¶1       ‘historical’ is historisch(en), i.e. ‘unsystematic, descriptive, in the manner of a
    chronicle’. It includes trivial historical facts, but is not confined to them, since in ¶1 Hegel
    also applies it to anatomy. Significant historical events and writing about them are
    geschichtlich. That Caesar ended the Roman republic is a geschichtliche truth; that he was
    born in 100  is a historische truth. Nevertheless research is required to establish that he
    was born in 100       . Such research requires ‘self-consciousness’ in that one does not simply
    accept the received answer to the question, but works it out for oneself. Even if one does not
    need to work it out, but has an           ‘immediate intuition’, just knows it, it is only the             ‘grounds’,
    i.e. the evidence, that gives the intuition             ‘true value’. However,         Anschauung has a wider
    range of meaning than ‘intuition’            and could mean direct observation of an event. So Hegel
    may also have in mind truths established by observation.
¶42. 1. Hegel’s criticisms of Euclid’s proofs for their                ‘externality’ recur in his Lectures on the
    Proofs of God’s Existence, II; and             Enc. I, ¶231. Schopenhauer’s The World as Will and
    Representation, I, ¶15 offers similar criticisms of Euclid’s                  ‘mouse-trap proofs’: they show
    that something so, but not why it is so; they are hard to follow, the reason for each step,
    e.g. the drawing of a line, being unclear at the time when it is taken; they do not explain why
    the theorems are believed, even by their original discoverers; they operate with concepts
    rather than with the spatial intuition appropriate to geometry. Hegel agrees, except that he
    shows no sign of hoping for an alternative, intuitive geometry, as Schopenhauer did.
       In Enc. I, ¶231 Hegel says that Kant ‘brought into vogue the phrase that mathematics
    “constructs”     its concepts’. To learn the properties of a right angled triangle, we must
    construct a diagram or a mental image of it: see CPR, Bxii, Prolegomena to Any Future
    Metaphysics, ¶7, and Critique of Judgement ¶¶138 and 241. (What we can construct also
    reveals the nature of space. We can construct a 2- or 3-dimensional sphere, but not a
    15-dimensional sphere, not because the latter is contradictory, but because space has only
    3 dimensions: see Körner (1960, p.28).) In doing this, one is primarily constructing a right
    angled triangle, but there is also a suggestion that one is construing or analysing the concept
    of a right angled triangle. But PS ¶¶42–4 deal with the construction not of a right angled
    triangle, but of additional lines and figures needed for the proof of the theorem. (See ¶51 for
    an apparently different type of ‘construction’.) The theorem as such does not bear on its face
    the fact that it can be proved, proved by this particular construction, or even that it can be
    proved at all. One might well understand and believe it without knowing any proof or even
    suspecting that it can be proved. The proof (or a proof, since there are alternative proofs)
    has to be found by trial and error. The right angled triangle does not ‘divide itself up’ in the
    way needed for its proof.
       Cognition involves two processes, the ‘becoming of the Being-there as Being-there’ and
    the  ‘becoming of the essence or the inner nature of the Thing’. Mathematics presents only
    the former, the ‘becoming of the Being of the nature of the Thing in cognition’. Being(-there)
    is the outer surface of things, while essence is their inner nature. Mathematics shows how
    the nature of, say, a right-angled triangle surfaces in our cognition, how we get to know it.
    But the way in which we get to know it has nothing to do with the nature of the Thing, with
    why it is as it is, e.g. why the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on
---

   the other two sides. Philosophy, by contrast, expounds both processes. PS’s arguments for
   and against a        ‘shape of consciousness’          are not ‘external’       to it. The     first shape,    ‘sensory
   certainty’, refutes itself by arguments that emerge from its own attempts to develop this
   position. The second shape, perception, is not simply plucked out of the air (in the way that
   Pythagoras’s theorem supposedly is) but emerges automatically from the collapse of sensory
   certainty, retaining the sensory particularity involved in sensory certainty from the start and
   also the universality that emerged within sensory certainty as a result of its self-criticism.
   Perception has to emerge from sensory certainty and the arguments against it; and it could
   not arise by any other route. A similar case, on a larger scale, is the proof of God’s existence.
   Even in their traditional form the arguments are not                       ‘external’    to what they attempt to
   prove. That is,        ‘God’    and    ‘God exists’     have no definite meaning that is presupposed
   independently of the proof. Their meaning is conferred by the proof. If we argue that
   God (or ‘the essence’) exists from the existence of contingent entities, then God is conceived
   as a necessary being. If we prove God’s existence from the apparent design in the world, then
   God is conceived as a purposive designer. This in itself differentiates these proofs from
   Euclid’s proofs, but Hegel takes a further step (Enc. I, ¶50): when we infer the existence of
   God from the ‘finite’ world, we alter our conception of the world (or ‘Being-there’). The
   world is no longer conceived as, say, an aggregate of contingent entities or as merely orderly.
   It is a world governed by universal laws and is an organic purposive whole. To infer the
   existence of God is not, in Hegel’s view, to infer the existence of an entity distinct from the
   world. It is to ascend from ‘Being’ to ‘thought’ and thus to elevate the world to thought. By
   contrast, the ‘ontological proof ’ proceeds in the reverse direction, from thought to Being
   (Enc. I, ¶51). In Hegel’s system it corresponds to the transition from Logic to the philosophy
   of nature, showing how the logical ‘Idea’ necessarily burgeons into a world of space, time,
   matter, etc. and eventually into the human mind itself. The ‘becoming of Being-there as
   Being-there’ is associated with (among other things) this process, the transition from logic
   to nature, while the ‘becoming of the essence’ is presented in the Logic itself, the extraction
   of the logical essence of the world and the passage to higher and higher logical categories.
   The becoming of the ‘substance’, i.e. of the logical ‘essence’, passes over into ‘externality’, i.e.
   nature, where it is ‘for another’, i.e. known to us. The becoming of Being-there is the
   ‘withdrawal into essence’, perhaps in the sense that nature leads on to mind, the culminating
   phase of which is philosophy, i.e. logic.
¶43. 1. The externality of          ‘insight’   alters the ‘true Thing’, the original figure, if it requires
   further construction. Then insight does not follow the intrinsic articulation of the ‘Thing’.
   On falsity and negativity, see ¶¶31f. Hegel’s parallel between the dismemberment of a
   geometrical figure and the           ‘disappearance’ of ‘purportedly            fixed’  ( festgemeinten) thoughts
   is not exact. The dismemberment of a triangle is not intrinsic to the triangle itself, but
   undertaken externally, while the disappearance of fixed thoughts results from the nature of
   the thoughts themselves: the philosopher, unlike the geometer, follows the intrinsic articu-
   lation of the subject-matter or           ‘Thing’. However, both cases involve negativity and falsity.
   Proof and construction dismember the triangle, but later restore it, rather as the                            ‘concept’
   demolishes fixed thoughts, but moves on to refurbished thoughts.
¶44. 1. ¶43 primarily dealt with the deficiency of geometrical cognition, but it implied,
   especially in its final sentence, that the ‘material’              lends itself to this deficient treatment. By
   contrast, ¶44 will deal with cognition itself. ‘External’                purposiveness contrasts with ‘inner’
   purposiveness: cf. ¶22. If one entity, a human being say, has a purpose which it realizes with
   respect to another entity, then the purposiveness is external. One difficulty with the
   distinction lies in deciding whether what appear to be two entities should be treated as a
   single entity or system. When animals of different species are associated with each other to
   their mutual benefit (when e.g. a small fish eats the parasites on a big fish or, for that matter,
---
                                                                                                              

    a doctor makes a living by curing patients) the two entities can reasonably be regarded as a
    single system characterized by inner purposiveness. When, by contrast, as in antagonistic
    symbiosis or parasitism, one animal benefits from the relationship to the detriment of the
    other, they should perhaps be counted as distinct entities and the purposiveness as external.
    But Hegel hardly establishes that the geometer is in antagonistic symbiosis with the right-
    angled triangle. After all, the point of the treatment imposed by a doctor may become
    apparent to the patient only retrospectively, after the patient is cured—rather as the triangle
    is eventually restored again.
       Hegel implicitly contrasts mathematical cognition with his own ‘scientific’ method, where
    it is supposedly apparent both that the starting point is intrinsically necessary (or at least
    justified) and that each subsequent step in the argument is necessitated (or at least justified)
    by its predecessor, not simply by the conclusion we are aiming at. Standard deduction does
    not supply the necessity that Hegel requires: the choice of a premise and the decision which,
    of the indefinitely many propositions it entails, to deduce from it, depend on the conclusion
    aimed at. Hegel tries to repair this apparent arbitrariness in philosophy and in logic, if not in
    mathematics.
¶45. 1.    ‘Purpose’ is glossed as ‘concept’ both in ironical contrast to ‘unconceptual’ magnitude and
    because a purpose involves a concept of what is aimed at. ‘Purpose’ is here the point of view from
    which mathematics considers its ‘material’. (Mathematics is not exclusively concerned with
    magnitude. Topological problems were current in Hegel’s day. There were seven bridges over the
    river Pregel in Königsberg, linking two islands and the mainland: was it possible to cross every
    bridge without crossing any of them twice? The answer (shown to be negative by Leonhard Euler
    (1707–1783)) does not depend on the size or the shape of the river or the bridges.)
       Why is magnitude an              ‘inessential, unconceptual relationship’, even though it is an
    essential, conceptual feature of geometrical                figures? Hegel is here thinking of magnitude
    in relation to concrete entities, such as houses, rocks, trees, people, etc. Their magnitude
    does not affect their essence: a house remains a house even if its size is altered (Enc. I., ¶99).
    Big changes in size do alter the nature of a house, making it a mansion or a doll’s house or,
    especially if the relative magnitudes of its parts are changed, altering its shape beyond any
    recognizable dwelling: cf. Enc. I, ¶108. But in the geometer’s space, changes in size, however
    great, need not affect the shape. Another argument for the superficiality of magnitude is that
    it becomes less important as the ontological hierarchy ascends from inorganic natural
    entities, through plants, animals, humanity, along with ‘freedom, law, morality, or even
    God himself ’: ‘in speaking of God as a Trinity, the number three has by no means the same
    prominence as when we consider the three dimensions of space or the three sides of a
    triangle’   (Enc. I, ¶99 Addition). Higher levels are not to be excluded from science (or
    reduced to arrangements of matter, as the proponent of quantity prefers). They are even the
    ‘essence’ or ‘concept’ of lower levels: the purpose of nature is to give rise to and accommo-
    date mind.
       The   ‘material’    of mathematics is distinct from its             ‘purpose’. Other things, such as time,
    can be quantified (cf. ¶46), but are not material for pure mathematics. Conversely, space
    and the unit may be treated non-quantitatively, as in Hegel’s Logic (e.g. Enc. I, ¶¶96–8 on
    the one and many) and Philosophy of Nature (Enc. II, ¶¶254–6 on space). In what follows it
    is unclear whether Hegel is describing space as such or space as mathematics conceives it.
    Thus it is uncertain whether his claim that the                 ‘concept inscribes its distinctions’           in space
    refers to the mathematician’s construction of figures or to the conceptual necessity of three
    spatial dimensions (as in the final sentence of ¶45 and in Enc. II, ¶255). The following
    sentence implies that he has the geometer’s space in mind, both because he specifies
    that the    ‘actual’ is not     ‘spatial, as it [viz. the spatial] is considered in mathematics’ and
    because he distinguishes mathematical objects from the objects of ‘concrete sensory intuition’.
---

    The geometer’s space and objects differ from real space and objects. Geometrical objects are
    unaffected by the proximity of other objects. They exert no force of attraction or repulsion,
    and one object can be removed without affecting the other—unlike the poles of a magnet,
    Hegel’s favourite model of           ‘essential opposition’. A change in the position of a geometrical
    object will not alter its size or its shape, and a change in its size will not require any change in
    its shape.
       Mathematical propositions are ‘dead’. They entail, and are entailed by, other propositions,
    but any proposition has a clear and definite sense regardless of its entailments, and the
    deduction of one from another leaves the sense and truth-value of both unchanged. There is
    no problem impelling them to link up with other such propositions, except the mathemat-
    ician’s external purpose of reaching a certain conclusion. This applies to standard deduction
    generally. In PS, by contrast, we start with a shape of consciousness, such as sensory
    certainty, which at        first seems acceptable, but on further consideration reveals                       flaws and
    an intrinsic tendency to metamorphose into perception; there is only one route for it to take,
    it does not have alternative destinations open to it.
¶46. 1. The      first sentence is a criticism of pure mathematics: it should consider time, but it
    does not. After an interlude on ‘applied mathematics’, Hegel returns to the topic, apparently
    saying that, since time is the          ‘counterpart’      to space, it is a deficiency of pure mathematics
    that it does not deal with it alongside space. In CPR Kant regarded space and time as two co-
    ordinate ‘forms of sensibility’ enabling us to order our sensory ‘intuitions’; he even suggests,
    albeit tentatively, that time plays a similar role in arithmetic as space does in geometry.
    However, later in CPR he gives time priority over space in our conceptual apprehension of
    the world. While Hegel disputes much in Kant’s account of time, he seems to accept that
    time is    ‘in juxtaposition to’ or the ‘counterpart of ’ space and that it therefore requires
    explanation if pure mathematics ignores it. But time, Hegel says, is the                                ‘concept itself
    being-there’ (der daseiende Begriff selbst). He makes no such parallel claim about space;
    he did say, in ¶45, that the concept ‘divides space into its dimensions’, but this only means that
    there is a conceptual necessity for the three-dimensionality of space, not that space is the
    concept itself being-there. In ¶801 he again says: ‘Time                   is the  concept itself that is there [der
    Begriff selbst, der      da ist], . . . .’ Before spirit or the Self has mastered itself conceptually, it
    ‘appears in time’, that is, phases of spirit, such as historical epochs, appear successively. But the
    claim that time is the concept that is there, is not equivalent to the claim that spirit appears in
    time. The former is rather the reason for the latter: spirit appears in time because                         time is the
    concept that is there, a seemingly ‘empty intuition’ that is an appropriate vehicle for immature
    spirit. Spirit also ‘estranges’, or externalizes, itself in space, but that is primarily in the form of
    nature rather than mind (¶807). The ‘unrest’ of time makes it an appropriate vehicle for spirit,
    but how is this related to its being the concept that is there? Hegel may mean simply that time
    is an appropriate vehicle for the implicitly conceptual spirit, before it is mastered by logic
    and is just ‘there’, not that time is the concept that is there independently of its housing spirit.
    However, he does not follow Kant in distinguishing between time and its contents.                                 Enc.  II,
    ¶¶200–3 suggests that time depends on the conceptually driven changes in its contents:
    time flows     because     finite entities change and perish. To combine this with his claim that
    time accommodates spirit because it is the concept that is there, we might say that time is the
    concept that is there       because of the small-scale changes that occur—the growth of trees, the
    death of animals, etc.—and it is because of that                    that it can accommodate the large-scale
    changes of spirit.       ‘Quantity’     and    ‘equality’, the principles deployed by mathematics, are
    intrinsically    ‘unconceptual’: they cannot differentiate the stages of spirit or reflect the logical
    relations between them. Hence the other branch of                      ‘pure’  mathematics, arithmetic with its
    static  ‘unit’, cannot do justice to the unrest of time and temporal things, and is only loosely
    related to time, if at all. Time is considered by applied mathematics, but only as a variable, not
---
                                                                                                              

    intrinsically, and not to Hegel’s satisfaction. His strictures on Galileo’s law of falling bodies are
    developed in Enc. II, ¶267 and in PS ¶¶153ff. He speaks of ‘synthetic’ propositions not in
    Kant’s sense, of a judgement whose predicate is not contained in the concept of the subject:
    the  ‘relationships’ of the variables are         determined by their concept, in Hegel’s more generous
    use of    ‘concept’. Hegel’s synthetic propositions concern the relationships between two
    variables. See also Inwood (1987) and Inwood (2012).
¶47. 1.    ‘Concept’ (Begriff ) is contrasted with ‘Being-there’ (Dasein), the realization or embodi-
    ment of the concept. Mathematics presents only an inessential determination of things,
    neither their concept nor their Being-there. ‘Historical’                    truths present the Being-there of
    things but not their concept: cf. ¶41. Philosophy presents both. In later works this combin-
    ation is often called        ‘Idea’ (Idee), but this word occurs only rarely in PS. None of these
    occurrences are linked with the Begriff-Dasein combination, which is here equated with ‘the
    actual’ (das Wirkliche).
       The ‘process’ constitutes e.g. the whole course of PS. Its ‘moments’ are the successive
    shapes of consciousness. PS as a whole is positive and true, but it contains also the negative,
    that is, each shape of consciousness as it turns out to be inadequate. On Hegel’s reluctance to
    conclude that such a shape is              ‘false’—since it is impossible to            ‘abstract’   from it, i.e. do
    without it—see ¶¶ 2, 24, 39: to describe it as false would be like saying that a sapling is false
    because it is not a full-grown tree. The ‘evanescent’, i.e. an inadequate and therefore negative
    shape of consciousness, is not separable from the                   ‘true’, i.e. the whole sequence of shapes,
    and so is not strictly false. What appears is the ‘true’, and presumably the ‘concept’, while its
    ‘appearance’ consists in the evanescent shapes of consciousness, which also amount to the
    ‘Being-there’ of the concept. The shapes of consciousness come and go, but the coming and
    going itself does not: there can be no concept without appearance. This explains why
    appearance constitutes the ‘actuality, etc.’. The shapes of consciousness are like the parti-
    cipants in a ‘frenzy’      or revel in honour of the god Bacchus or Dionysus. Each in turn breaks
    loose from the other revellers, but in doing so, dissolves or collapses and gives way to
    another reveller, who undergoes the same fate. Because of this, the revel is also a ‘repose’, as
    well as a movement. This may explain why the coming and going of the shapes is
    characterized as       ‘in itself ’  (an sich). When a reveller or shape of consciousness breaks
    loose, it becomes for itself rather than simply in itself: it passes from mere potentiality into
    actuality and becomes conscious of itself. But the coming and going itself is in itself: it does
    not break loose in the way that particular shapes do. The shapes, like the                               ‘determinate
    thoughts’ that underpin them and that resurface in their purity in Logic, are each condemned
    before a ‘court of judgement’ for their breakaway, but are still necessary to the whole.
       In the final sentence ‘recollects itself ’         translates ‘sich erinnert’.      Erinnern normally means
    ‘remind’, and the reflexive,         sich erinnern,      ‘remind oneself, remember, recollect’. However,
    Hegel often uses the word in accordance with what he takes to be its root meaning,                                    ‘to
    internalize, interiorize’, often combining this with its standard meaning. Recollection occurs
    at a variety of levels: cf. ¶¶13, 28, 29. But the closest parallel to this passage is ¶808, where
    Erinnerung      is distinguished from ‘withdrawal-into-itself ’ (Insichgehen), i.e. interiorization,
    but closely connected with it. In ¶47 two types of recollection are in play: (1) Each shape of
    consciousness is recollected immediately after its demise and is incorporated into its
    successor. As Yovel (2005) notes, this is connected with, and perhaps a necessary condition
    for, the fact that Hegelian negation of negation does not simply revert to the starting-point
    (p.155). It is more like a couple who marry, then divorce, then remarry each other, carrying
    with them the memory of their first marriage and intervening separation. Hegelian negation
    may involve emotions, etc., not only propositions: naive love—indifference/hostility—
    sophisticated love. Moreover, Hegelian negation is determinate—unlike standard negation,
    where ‘It’s not green’         does not tell us what colour it is. Hegelian negation is not                        sheer
---
      

    negation, as in standard logic, but determinate also in the sense that it is powered by
    internal defects in the position negated, and these internal defects place restrictions on the
    outcome of the negation. (2) At the conclusion of the series of shapes of consciousness, there
    is a global ‘recollection’ of the whole series on the part of Hegel and his readers, a recollection
    that constitutes at least a part of           ‘absolute knowledge’ and which, Hegel hoped, leads on
    to Logic.
       Both types of recollection involve ‘self-knowledge’. In taking the centre of the stage (its
    Being-there) and working through its difficulties, a shape of consciousness discovers what it
    amounts to; in surveying the whole course of PS,                   we discover what we amount to.
¶48. 1. A method is a way of doing something, e.g. a way of making plants grow by fertilizers,
    etc. One might have no method, but just let plants grow of their own accord. In that case, if
    there is any method ‘of ’ their growth, it is simply the ‘concept’                   of the plants, immanent in
    each seed. Analogously, Hegel has no method that he applies to the                               ‘movement’       or to
    ‘science’, no way of his own for generating them. It is the ‘concept’, their intrinsic structure,
    that accounts for them; Hegel simply lets them emerge of their own accord and watches
    their development: cf.          Enc. I, ¶79–82 on external and internal dialectic. One                      ‘external’
    method that philosophers, such as Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, and Christian Wolff, applied
    to philosophy was mathematics. A remnant of this is the tendency to support or refute
    propositions with         ‘reasons’   (Gründe, literally       ‘grounds’). Reasons of this type are quite
    different from       ‘reason’,   Vernunft. A       Grund     may be external to that for which it is the
    reason. Thus Euclid’s reason for Pythagoras’s theorem is external to the theorem itself and
    shows only that it is true, not why it is true. Unlike               Vernunft, Gründe are not immanent in
    the Thing. Moreover, reasons for believing or doing something are rarely conclusive. They
    select only one aspect of a complex concrete phenomenon. There are reasons for stealing or
    for deserting one’s post in battle, and reasons against, but Vernunft settles the matter in a
    way that Gründe cannot. It might be objected that Hegel’s preference for Vernunft over
    Gründe does not entail the exclusion of mathematics from philosophy. It might, after all, be
    the case that mathematical methods mirror the intrinsic structure or movement of the
    subject-matter. However, Hegel is deeply averse to the application of quantitative concepts
    and methods beyond the realm of mathematics itself. Like many of his contemporaries, such
    as Goethe, Hegel turned to biology. The appropriate model for philosophy was the living
    organism, with some assistance from the equally non-mathematical phenomena of electri-
    city and magnetism. The             ‘truth’   develops like a living organism, each part of which is
    connected with every other part, while Hegel himself simply watches. There is no place in
    this development for the application of numbers, reason-giving, or ‘free wilfulness’. Every
    organ has it allotted place, allowing no free decision on the philosopher’s part.
¶49. 1. For Hegel,         ‘ratiocination’     (räsonnieren,      Räsonnement) is invariably pejorative and
    associated with reasoning from grounds, giving reasons for a belief or a course of action.
¶50. 1. Kant       rediscovered triplicity, since the triadic schema was favoured by such Neopla-
    tonists as Plotinus and Proclus, especially in the form of remaining–procession–return.
    Kant’s most explicit triplicity occurs in his table of forms of judgement (CPR, A70, B95)
    and of the categories derived from them (CPR, A80, B106). The third term is in each case a
    ‘synthesis’ or ‘combination’ of the first two: e.g. the three forms of judgement of ‘relation’—
    categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive, are respectively thesis, antithesis, and synthesis,
    and give rise to three corresponding categories: substance, causality, and reciprocal inter-
    action. Hegel regards this use of triplicity as ‘dead’ and ‘unconceptualized’, because it involves
    no movement immanent in the Thing. If anyone, apart from Hegel himself, elevated triplicity
    to its ‘absolute meaning’, it was Fichte, who made liberal use of the terms ‘thesis’, ‘antithesis’,
    ‘synthesis’ and also of triadic movement. Fichte’s first triad is: the self-positing I, the counter-
    positing of the non-I, and the positing of a divisible non-I over against the divisible I. If

                                                                                                              

    anyone degraded it to a ‘lifeless schema’, it was Schelling. Schelling’s absolute manifests itself
    in two Potenzen (‘powers’, especially in mathematics), the real (nature) and the ideal (spirit),
    while the absolute itself is the ‘indifference’ between the two. Nature, in turn, involves a real
    Potenz (matter), an ideal Potenz (light), and a Potenz of indifference (the organism); spirit is
    similarly split into knowledge, action, and art. Each of these terms is again divided and
    subdivided into three. Cf. ¶15 on formalism, and ¶¶20 and 23 on predication.
       Hegel began by discussing triplicity, but now seems to turn to dualism, since the offending
    predicates are either polar phenomena (magnetism, electricity) or pairs of opposites (sub-
    jectivity/objectivity, contraction/expansion, East/West, etc.). The dualities have, however, a
    point of    ‘indifference’ between two extremes. Schelling’s absolute, e.g., is the indifference
    between nature and spirit. This arrangement was inspired by magnetism and electricity,
    with their point of indifference between the opposite poles of a bar magnet and the neutral
    state between a positive and a negative electric charge. But the focus of Hegel’s interest is no
    longer the schema’s triplicity, but the arbitrariness of the                        ‘predicates’    deployed in its
    application. Triplicity and fanciful predication are distinct. Kant regards three items as
    respectively thesis, antithesis, and synthesis without applying any extraneous predicates.
    Conversely, Hegel’s criticism of ‘formalism’ in ¶15 does not mention triplicity. Thus Hegel
    has two distinct objections to formalistic triplicity. First, the triad must emerge naturally
    from the terms and not be arbitrarily imposed; this requires a logical development on the
    part of the terms themselves, not simply in the mind of the philosopher. Secondly, the
    triadic movement must be genuinely explanatory of the terms and not require additional
    analogies. If we say, e.g.,         ‘Love is a magnetic attraction between a positive pole and a
    negative pole’, this tells us little about either love or magnetism. If we go on to say that
    magnetic attraction and repulsion are (somewhat like) love and hatred, we are entering a
    never-ending ‘circle of reciprocity’, where each ‘shape’                  takes in the washing of the other.
¶51. 1. On       ‘construction’, see ¶42. But here             Konstruktion       is more akin to        ‘construing’     or
    ‘interpreting’ than to        ‘constructing’. Abstract, non-sensory concepts are assigned sensory
    counterparts, e.g. the intellect is electricity. This looks like the patter of a bingo-caller, who
    assigns to the number 88 the sensory idea of ‘two fat ladies’. But it does have some affinity to
    Kant’s procedure of assigning a sensory idea to a non-sensory one. It may even have some
    similarity to the additional lines drawn by the geometer, if the association with electricity
    enables us to draw significant conclusions about the intellect that we could otherwise reach
    either with difficulty or not at all.
       More generally, Hegel derides simplistic classifications, such as that of diseases into
    asthenic and sthenic (diseases arising from or characterized by weakness and diseases
    characterized by abnormal or excessive energy), or that of plants into herbs, shrubs, and
    trees. He prefers a taxonomy based on the interconnectedness of nature, where each animal
    and plant species depends on and supports others, as implied by his reference to the
    ‘organism of the universe’, in contrast to the skeleton or set of boxes to which formalism
    reduces it. Hegel runs together different criticisms of formalism: (1) Static classification that
    neglects the      ‘organic’    structure of the universe. (2) Classification in terms of too few
    alternatives, as painting with only two colours. (3) The introduction of superficial analogies.
    (4) Its inability to     find an adequate relationship between the terms of the schema and the
    absolute or the Idea (cf. ¶15), so that it ends up with only one colour on its palette.
¶52. 1. As usual, Hegel takes his criticism of a theory not as a need to make a new beginning,
    but as containing the material from which a new and better theory will emerge.                            ‘Excellence’
    might refer to triplicity, or to the general aim of establishing a universal system. But order
    must emerge from the material itself, not just be                 ‘stuck onto’ it: cf. ¶53.
¶53. 1.    ‘That which is’      (des Seienden) has a wide scope, applying both to the ‘concept’                      and to
    the concrete ‘Being-there’ into which it unfolds. As in ¶2, the concept is something like the
---
     

   plan in a seed that unfolds into a plant or the screenplay that unfolds into a film. This
   concept first becomes ‘other’           than itself, that is, no longer a mere concept, but the Being-
   there of the ‘content’       immanent in it, the actual plant or             film. This is a sort of negation of
   itself. Then there is a converse movement, whereby the concept withdraws its Being-there
   into itself again and becomes a ‘determinate simplicity’ and itself a ‘moment’ of the whole:
   the organizing principle of that which is, is itself a moment or constituent of it and not
   something supplied from outside. This applies not only to temporal processes, such as the
   growth of a plant or a film. It also applies, say, to the structure of the human body and the
   study of it by anatomy. One might simply list the parts of the body (a ‘table of contents’) or,
   more adventurously, study its structure in descriptive morphology. But at a more advanced
   stage we learn the functions of the various organs and how they interact with each other to
   form a system, in fact a system of systems, e.g. the muscular system, the nervous system, and
   so on. That this overall system in biological organisms is regarded by Hegel as deriving from
   a concept owes much to Kant’s              Critique of Judgement. It applies more properly to a system
   such as Hegel’s, where it is obviously inadequate simply to list its contents, when the overall
   conception and the movement from one stage to another is integral to the system. This
   explains the aversion to prefaces expressed in ¶¶1f., along with a comparison with anatomy.
   Hegel has in mind the development of his own system rather than the human body, when
   he speaks of the becoming of a ‘determinate simplicity’, e.g. the shape of consciousness that
   emerges from the ruins of its predecessor, and of its passing over into a                        ‘higher truth’, e.g.
   the more advanced shape of consciousness.
¶54. 1. On substance as subject, see ¶¶17f. In ¶18 the reflection into itself is that of the
   substance-subject, and so it must be here too, though grammatically (seine eigene reflexion)
   it could be that of the        ‘content’: the content is the ‘Being-there’ that the substance-subject
   generates. Hegel is now trying to show that its generation of Being-there and the subsequent
   dissolution of that Being-there and its replacement by another is a deep conceptual
   necessity. He is also trying to show that his own knowledge of this process is not an
   additional supplement that comes to substance from outside, but is involved in the very
   logic of substance itself. The first aim is approached by way of a brief replay of the dialectic
   of Being-there and quality, as found e.g. in Enc. I, ¶¶86–95. A particular ‘Being-there’ has a
   quality with which it is indissolubly associated and which differentiates it from any other
   Being-there: see        Enc. I, ¶90. It starts off as            ‘equal-to-itself ’, self-contained and self-
   consistent. But in virtue of its essential relationship to other Being-theres it inevitably
   loses it equality-to-itself and succumbs to dissolution. This happens because equality-
   with-self is a pure        ‘abstraction’, it is a thought that          ‘abstracts from’ the concrete details
   such as the specific quality the Being-there has; so the Being-there abstracts itself from itself,
   from its own equality-to-itself, and thus becomes unequal-to-itself and dissolves. This is
   why Being is thinking: the fundamental natures of things correspond to our own pure or
   abstract thoughts, and things must undergo changes that mirror the development of our
   thoughts. It is because of this isomorphism between things and thoughts that our knowledge
   of things can be both fully absorbed in them and watch them develop without intervening. It
   need not interfere and make things dissolve; they dissolve of their own accord, because they
   share the nature of thinking.
¶55. 1. Cf. ¶17 on Spinoza. The self-consciousness of substance is contrasted with substance
   ‘as it simply is’      (als seiender). Because Being-there has or ‘is’ a quality, and quality is a
   ‘determinate thought’, Being-there has or involves                    ‘understanding’. (The genitive in ‘the
   understanding of Being-there’ is objective, not subjective, and ‘understanding’ is not verbal,
   but Verstand, roughly         ‘intellect’.) Anaxagoras (c.500–428 ) believed that an all-pervasive
   cosmic nous, mind or intellect, brings order into the chaos of material particles. An eidos or
   idea   is a ‘form’   or ‘Idea’, postulated by Plato and accepted, though in a different sense, by
---
                                                                                                              

    Aristotle. In Plato’s      Phaedo, 97b8ff., Socrates gives an account of his disillusionment with
    Anaxagoras and of his own turn to forms or Ideas. An Art is a ‘kind, sort, species’. One reason
    for resisting its application to Platonic forms is that a form is often regarded as an ideal
    exemplar, not simply as a general kind. E.g. the form of beauty in Plato’s Phaedo and Symposium
    is supremely beautiful, far exceeding the beauty of the things that ‘participate’ in it, and an object
    of adoration. But this is less likely to be the case with more lowly forms, and elsewhere Plato
    thinks of a form as simply ‘one over many’, a solution to the problem of universals. Hegel is
    concerned with such lesser forms as quality and Being-there. But he also retains                          nous, in the
    sense of ‘understanding’, as the stable substance underlying the Being-there that it generates.
       A kind is a thought. So since Being-there falls into kinds, it is governed by thought, not
    human thinking, but the thought immanent in Being-there. Hence nous or understanding is
    the underlying substance of Being-there. To the extent that something, whether a thing or a
    thought, is    ‘equal-to-itself ’ it is internally harmonious and does not change or perish. Nous
    is ‘simple’ and because of this it seems equal-to-itself and thus stable. The understanding is,
    in Hegel’s view, a rigid way of thinking that deals in stable concepts and clear-cut
    distinctions. Its very simplicity seems to exclude internal discord. However, as a mode of
    thinking, the understanding involves negativity: it transcends and negates the current object
    of its thought. Being-there seems to depend for its determinacy on its contrast with and
    relation to other Being-there (cf. ¶16): plant and animal species are what they are because of
    their contrast and interaction with each other. And the dissolution of a Being-there seems to
    come from the encroachment on it of other Being-there, the death of an antelope, e.g., from
    the claws and teeth of a lion. But in fact it is because of the thought involved in it that any
    finite entity is doomed to perish. It is because of thought that the entity contains its
    ‘otherness’    in it and changes and perishes even without the intervention of external forces.
    Thought inevitably develops and differentiates itself, even though it is self-contained
    (‘its own inwardness’) and it is because the things of the world involve thought that they
    too develop, differentiate themselves and perish. When we distinguish the rigid                            ‘intellectu-
    ality of the understanding’ (Verständigkeit) from the                     fluid, developing       ‘rationality’   (Ver-
    nünftigkeit) of reason, we should not suppose that they belong in separate, water-tight
    compartments. (This would in itself contravene the requirements of reason.) Understand-
    ing, the postulation of distinctness and ‘equality-to-itself ’, is an essential feature of thinking,
    as well as of the structure of the world. But because understanding is thinking, its distinc-
    tions and putatively stable thoughts inevitably break down and succumb to the negativity of
    reason. Understanding veers over into reason.
¶56. 1. See ¶¶34 and 53 on the human body. We must respect its intrinsic systematic structure
    and not impose our own schematism on the bodily organs as if they were a random
    aggregate of items such as we find in a butcher’s shop or an auction room. Such a structure
    depends on its conceptual or logical underpinning. Hegel exaggerates, however, in claiming
    that   all entities are systematically structured.               Enc. I, ¶16 concedes that some areas of
    learning, especially heraldry, deal with phenomena that are wholly arbitrary. Other sciences,
    such as jurisprudence, natural history, geography, medicine, etc. have a rational basis, but
    soon descend into details with no rational explanation. Similarly, history is determined in its
    broad outlines by the ‘concept’            or the   ‘Idea’, but involves contingency, deriving especially
    from our free choices. ‘Logical necessity’ holds sway only at a high level of abstraction. Hegel
    provides no clear criterion for deciding where necessity ends and contingency begins, nor is
    it always clear where he locates the boundary between them. There also remains the
    question whether the         ‘movement’       is only logical (as in logic itself and—on Hegel’s view—
    in nature) or also temporal (as in history). Hegel clearly regards the order in which the
    terms occur as logical, both in his Logic and in PS, and this logical order is mirrored in a
    corresponding temporal sequence in the minds of Hegel and his readers. But to what extent
---
      

    does Hegel regard the logical order as mirrored in the historical development of humanity?
    He makes some attempt to correlate early stages of his Logic with stages in the history of
    philosophy, the concept of pure Being corresponding to Parmenides and that of becoming
    to Heraclitus, but thereafter his attempt to correlate the two orders becomes piecemeal and
    arbitrary. On the face of it, much of PS is not correlated with history, and those parts of it
    that are fall into three distinct historical sequences: from early Greece and/or the state of
    nature down to medieval Christianity (Self-consciousness: the struggle for recognition-
    Stoicism–Scepticism–the Unhappy Consciousness), from the Greek city-state to the French
    revolution and Kantian morality (Spirit), and from ancient Persia or thereabouts down to
    the Reformation (Religion). Critics of Hegel, such as Adolf Trendelenberg (1802–1872) and
    Hermann Lotze (1816–1881), have long argued that Hegel’s belief that concepts are
    embedded in extra-logical things and determine their structure as well as, in some cases,
    their development over time, is fallacious. On their view the dialectic that is supposed to
    power the transition from one concept to another, relies on a confusion between logical
    negation and physical concepts such as repulsion. Hegel tends to equate the structure of
    reality (the order of Being) with the structure of our thoughts about reality (the order of
    knowing), as if abstract concepts were objective forces, not only driving us on from one
    concept to the next, but also at work causally within the world. He did not regard concepts
    such as Being as simply abstractions; concepts are embedded in things in something like the
    way in which the genetic code of a plant is embedded in a seed: cf. ¶47. The temporal
    development of such things as do develop over time—philosophy, history, shapes of
    consciousness—should therefore correspond to the logical order in which thoughts develop.
    However, he gives no clear criterion for deciding when a logical sequence gives rise to a
    corresponding temporal sequence, and when it does not, and again it is unclear where he
    locates the boundary between the two cases.
¶57. 1. Hegel’s belief that his subject-matter has an intrinsic logical structure of its own
    accounts for his claim that he is simply watching the subject-matter develop and not
    imposing his own views on it. ‘Speculative philosophy’ originally meant ‘theoretical phil-
    osophy’     in contrast to ‘practical philosophy’. However, Hegel uses it to mean his own
    dialectical philosophy and, more specifically, the third stage of the dialectical movement, in
    which the opposed categories that are initially fixed (Enc. I, ¶80) and dialectically broken
    down at the second stage (Enc. I, ¶81), are sublated into a new ‘totality’ at the third stage
    (Enc. I, ¶82). Approval of novelty has the same motivation as aversion to it: to save one’s
    freedom, etc. It is analogous to the ill-considered support for French revolutionaries. Hegel’s
    own view is that a new proposal, such as his own, should be judged by the arguments for it
    and by its concrete working out, not rejected thoughtlessly, nor thoughtlessly accepted.
¶58. 1. The concept is the logical underpinning responsible for the                      ‘movement’ of things and
    ideas. Here the concept encompasses all the ‘determinations’ of a logical sort. They are ‘self-
    movements’ in that they both lead into other determinations and also account for the
    movement of other things. In the latter respect they are like ‘souls’, since they animate the
    bodies that they inhabit. Thought-determinations are, however, higher than the soul in that,
    while the soul merely makes the body alive and enables it to move, conceptual thought
    constitutes the intellectual and rational core of the mind. ‘Representations’                      (Vorstellungen)
    are ideas with empirical content, either ordinary ideas such as that of a tiger, or pictorial,
    especially religious, ideas, such as God the Father, standing in for properly conceptual
    thoughts, such as the absolute Idea. ‘Ratiocination’ (Räsonnieren) is thinking that ignores
    the intrinsic structure of the subject-matter.                ‘Material thinking’       is too absorbed in the
    subject-matter, while ratiocination is too remote from it.
¶59. 1. The first aspect is considered in ¶59 and the second in ¶60. Hegel’s characterization of
    ratiocination in ¶58 does not entail that it is negative and refutative. Thinking that neglects
---
                                                                                                             

    the intrinsic nature of the subject-matter might express its freedom by interpreting it in an
    arbitrary or perverse way rather than by refuting it. But Hegel now introduces a recurrent
    theme in his account of traditional scepticism, viz. that its refutation of a position does not
    lead to a new position. Nor does the Socratic elenchus: Socrates refutes various answers to
    the question ‘What is virtue (courage, piety, etc.)?’ but the refutation of one answer does not
    give rise to the next answer, let alone the correct answer. Hence the sceptic (or Socrates) has
    to look elsewhere for another position to consider and refute; it does not automatically
    emerge from the remnants of the position previously negated. The ratiocinator is therefore
    an ‘empty I’, with no accumulated knowledge or beliefs of his own, but simply refuting the
    putative knowledge of others. Socrates claims to know nothing himself, but simply refutes
    his interlocutor’s claim by revealing its inconsistency with the interlocutor’s other beliefs.
    Hegel probably also has in mind such romantics as Friedrich von Schlegel, who acknow-
    ledged a debt to Socrates’s ‘irony’, or ‘feigned ignorance’: cf. Hegel (1993), pp.69ff.                      ‘Vanity’,
    Eitelkeit, from eitel, ‘vain’, here combines the meanings of ‘excessive pride, futility/failure,
    emptiness’.
       Hegel differs in two respects. First, the negation of one term—such as a thought-determination,
    an aspect of nature, or, in PS, a shape of consciousness—leads directly into another term.
    Secondly, the first term is not simply rejected and entirely replaced by its successor. It is
    ‘sublated’, that is, retained and elevated, as well as negated: it is both incorporated into its
    successor and retained in the overall system of nature, logic, shapes of consciousness, or
    whatever. Hence the philosophizing I, Hegel and his readers, is not an empty I, but accumulates,
    and deploys, progressively richer knowledge.
¶60. 1. Hegel now turns to the second aspect of ratiocination heralded in ¶59. The difficulty
    of ¶60 is alleviated by what follows, especially by the examples in ¶62: ‘God is Being’ and
    ‘The actual is the universal’. The former is a ‘mixture’ of representations and thoughts, since
    ‘God’ is a representation, while ‘Being’ is a thought; the second consists of thoughts only.
    The reference to the          ‘Idea’  is relatively unspecific, but it may point to the account of
    ‘scientific method’ in ¶¶56 and 57. One difficulty is that Hegel uses the word ‘subject’ to
    mean both the thinking subject, the ‘Self ’, and the grammatical and/or logical subject of
    predication: cf. ¶17. This is more than a simple confusion. In an ordinary subject-predicate
    proposition such as ‘God is worshipped by many’ or ‘The cat is black’, the grammatical
    subject, God, the cat (or          ‘God’,   ‘the cat’) is fixed and stable. It is not sublated into the
    predicate (term), since the predicate does not exhaust the subject and is not identical with it,
    not even partially, because the predicate is a universal that applies to other entities too.
    Because of this disparity between the grammatical subject and its predicate, the thinking
    subject (the      ‘second subject’), basing itself on the              fixed grammatical subject (the             ‘first
    subject’), goes beyond the predicate and decides what further predicates to ascribe to it.
    This second subject is the ‘nexus’ binding together the first subject with its predicates. By
    contrast, in a conceptual or essential identity proposition, such as ‘God is Being’, Being is
    the substance or essence of the            first subject, and so the second subject cannot go beyond
    it, since no further predicates of the same kind can be assigned to the                                first subject.
    Moreover, the second subject does not even have a                          firm foothold for its movement
    between the subject and its predicate, since the                 first subject is no longer fixed and stable,
    but is sublated in its predicate. There may be a grammatical nexus between the word
    ‘God’   and the word ‘Being’, but there is no nexus between God and Being: God simply is
    Being, and the representation of God has ‘become’ the thought of Being. The ratiocin-
    ation of the second subject is not required to effect this movement. Instead of operating
    freely, ‘for itself ’    or by itself, it simply has to go along,              ‘cooperate’, with the intrinsic
    movement of the concept and its content. The two subjects, the knowing and the
    grammatical subject, thus converge.

¶61. 1. In a proposition such as ‘The cat is black’, the subject is distinct from the predicate. The
    cat is not identical with blackness, since blackness applies to other things too, the cat has
    other properties apart from blackness, and it could be or become some other colour while
    remaining the same cat. Hence the cat is not even identical with the trope, its                             blackness,
    the particular blackness of this particular cat that does not belong to anything else. The
    proposition ‘God is Being’ seems to have the same logical structure as ‘The cat is black’, as if
    God is distinct from Being in the way that the cat is distinct from blackness. But this ‘formal’
    appearance is delusive. God is not distinct from Being in this way. Some of Hegel’s claims
    about the proposition         ‘God is Being’       would also apply to such an identity proposition as
    ‘Tully is Cicero’, except that the latter claim is not reductive: Tully is not sublated in Cicero,
    he exists just as fully as Cicero. By contrast, identity propositions such as ‘Dame Edna
    Everage is Barry Humphries’,            ‘Ali G is Sacha Baron Cohen’, or ‘Flying saucers are lenticular
    clouds’ are reductive. They entail that Dame Edna Everage, Ali G, and flying saucers do not
    (really) exist. Reductive identity statements are not reversible                   salva veritate: while it is true
    that Dame Edna Everage is Barry Humphries, it is not true that Barry Humphries is Dame
    Edna Everage, not at least in the sense in which it is equivalent to saying ‘Barry Humphries
    is just (only, nothing more than) Dame Edna Everage’, implying that Barry Humphries does
    not (really) exist or is not a real person. ‘God is Being’, as Hegel understands it, shares some,
    but not all, of the properties of both these types of identity proposition. On the one hand, it
    is somewhat reductive, yet on the other hand it does not entail                     ‘God does not exist’. It looks
    as if it should be reversible        salva veritate: if God is Being, then Being is God. On the other
    hand, Hegel clearly does not think that ‘Being is God’ has the same force as                          ‘God is Being’.
    To say ‘Being is God’ is to move in the wrong direction. We might compare ‘Tully is Cicero’
    as said to someone who knows who Cicero is but not who Tully is. Unless a special stress is
    placed on the word ‘Cicero’,            ‘Cicero is Tully’      is not the appropriate answer to his query.
    A better analogy might be the Frege-Russell definition of, say, the number 3 as the class of all
    classes containing exactly 3 members. The identity proposition to which this gives rise (‘The
    number 3 is the class of all classes, etc.’) is reversible salva veritate, but again the reversal
    (‘The class of all classes . . . is the number 3’) moves in the wrong direction.
       The propositional form suggests that God and Being are distinct, like the cat and
    blackness. This suggestion is foiled by the                 ‘unity of the concept’, the unity of God and
    Being. In the     ‘philosophical proposition’           the ‘subject’   and the ‘predicate’        are identical, but
    this does not eliminate the ‘difference’ between them. The proposition does not express a
    trivial identity, such as        ‘God is God’       or, indeed, simply        ‘God’, in which no ‘movement’
    occurs at all. God and Being are different, despite their identity. (Yovel, 2005, p.183, says:
    ‘The predicates must have distinctive differences which add specificity and                             filling to the
    subject, rather than simply repeating it in general terms (as in “God is Being”).’ Hegel does
    believe ‘God is Being’ to be an impoverished account of God, which needs                             ‘specificity and
    filling’. But he is not saying this here. His point is that God and Being do have the required
    difference.) In expressing the difference between God and Being the propositional form
    plays a vital service. ‘God is Being’ looks like a subject-predicate proposition, which conveys
    the difference between God and Being, though not their identity, whereas ‘God is God’                                  or
    simply    ‘God’, do not look like propositions at all. It is therefore the tension and interplay
    between the propositional form and the speculative content that gives rise to the ‘speculative
    proposition’. Since the quasi-predicate,              ‘Being’, expresses the substance, and the subject,
    ‘God’,   ‘falls into the universal’      (i.e. is or becomes universal, though not the sort of universal
    that applies to several things), they form a ‘unity’ or ‘harmony’ (like a pleasing combination
    of musical sounds) rather than a sheer identity.
       ‘Metre’ is a regular pattern of syllables in poetry. ‘Accent’ is the stress placed on some
    syllables, but not others. There may be              ‘conflict’   between metre and accent, if the number

    and length of syllables in a line, and the pattern of accentuation in a line give different ways
    of determining the rhythm. Hegel’s preferred rhythm is the accentual-syllabic, where the
    syllables and the accentuation harmonize. Analogously, there is a conflict between the
    propositional form (‘accent’), which expresses the difference between God and Being, and
    the content of the proposition, which involves their identity (‘metre’). This conflict gives rise
    to a harmony between God and Being.
¶62. 1. Hegel uses italics to insist that in             ‘God is Being’, the predicate,         ‘Being [das Sein]’, is a
    singular, not a universal term, hence that the proposition is an identity statement. Because
    of this, ratiocination cannot exercise its freedom in going beyond the predicate in search of
    further predicates; it has to focus on Being. ‘God’ expresses a pictorial representation rather
    than a thought; hence ‘God is Being’              is a ‘metaphysical definition of God’, which expresses
    ‘his nature in thoughts’ (Enc. I, ¶85). By contrast, ‘the actual’ and ‘the universal’ both express
    thoughts; hence ‘The actual is the universal’                  is a proposition within logic, not a linkage
    between logic and representations. My use of capital letters reflects Hegel’s distinction
    between ‘das Wirkliche ist das Allgemeine’ and ‘das Wirkliche ist allgemein’, the latter being
    an ordinary subject-predicate proposition, while the former is a speculative proposition.
¶63. 1. Hegel underrates the difficulty of his language. Identity statements such as ‘Tully is
    Cicero’, ‘Water is H 2 O’, or ‘Jehovah is God’, do not present the same, or as much, difficulty
    as  ‘God is Being’      and ‘The actual is the universal’. In explaining the ‘philosophical propos-
    ition’ he plays with the words ‘Meinung’ (‘opinion’) and ‘meinen’, which means both ‘opine,
    think, believe’     and ‘mean, intend, mean to say’.
¶64. 1. On this difficulty, see ¶66. Hegel says that it should be avoided, but he does not claim to
    have done so, and the subjunctives in the second sentence suggest that he has not. Plastic is
    stuff that can be moulded. It can be stretched, bent, or squeezed into a different shape while
    remaining the same substance. This seems an appropriate way of describing what happens
    to God when he is equated with Being.
¶65. 1. Hegel’s concession to ‘non-speculative’                 thinking is a prelude to his further move away
    from it. We must not rest content with such a proposition as ‘God is Being’ or ‘The actual is
    the universal’, relying on the internal             ‘inhibition’    to interpret the sentence, nor appeal to
    ‘inner intuition’       to certify its truth. Nor, again, are we to prove or demonstrate the
    proposition by deducing it from premises. The                    ‘return of the concept into itself ’          must be
    ‘presented’.     Enc. I, ¶17 expands on this: instead of going back to the rear and proving the
    proposition from supposed first premises, we are to go forwards, deriving further proposi-
    tions from our starting-point (such as ‘God is Being’); then, the ‘first act’ will circle back on
    itself and ‘make itself into the result, . . . in which it reaches its beginning again and returns
    into itself ’; the ‘concept of the Science and therefore the first concept . . . must be grasped by
    the Science itself ’, which thus arrives at the ‘Concept of its concept and . . . at its return [into
    itself ] . . . ’. (Cf. T.S. Eliot: ‘The token that a philosophy is true is, I think, the fact that it
    brings us to the exact point from where we started’.) Another idea is that this progressive
    movement does not involve a series of propositions, not at least of subject-predicate
    propositions. For the subject, whether it be God or the absolute, is not a substratum that
    has a character of its own, independently of the predicate; what God or the absolute is is
    known only through the predicate and all the content of the proposition thus falls into the
    predicate. Hence ‘the propositional form, as well as the subject [of the proposition], is
    something completely superfluous’                 (Enc. I, ¶31. Cf. ¶85). So Hegel, in his Logic, goes
    forward, proceeding from Being to nothing and from there to becoming, not by way of
    such propositions as         ‘God/the absolute is nothing/becoming’, but by claims such as ‘[P]ure
    Being is . . . nothing’     (Enc. I, ¶87),     ‘[N]othing . . . is the same as Being’, and ‘[T]he truth of
    Being and nothing alike is the unity of both of them; this unity is becoming’ (Enc. I, ¶88).
    These look much like propositions, though not propositions of the same type as                                ‘God/the

   absolute is Being’, let alone ‘The cat is black’. Nevertheless, Hegel’s idea is that the essential
   elements in this progression are the              ‘thought-determinations’, Being, nothing, becoming,
   etc.—or, in PS, the ‘shapes of consciousness’. The other words in the sentences in which they
   figure are simply the explanatory framework, explaining in particular why each thought-
   determination moves on into the next. ‘The true is the subject’, not in the sense of ‘subject’
   in which it is correlative with a predicate, but in the sense of the subject of activity, as in
   ¶¶17 and 18.
¶66. 1. Hegel has mentioned only one difficulty in the vicinity of this paragraph, viz. ‘mixing
   together the speculative mode and the ratiocinative mode, when what is said of the subject
   at one time has the meaning of its concept, while at another time it has only the meaning of
   its predicate or accidental property’ (¶64). One would be mixing genres in this way, if one
   said, e.g., ‘God is Being’         and ‘God is worshipped’; the former expresses the essence or
   ‘concept’ of God, while the latter predicates of it a property that it shares with other things.
   However, in ¶66 Hegel mentions only the occurrence of propositions, not specifically
   subject-predicate propositions. Hence it is unclear whether the difficulty involves his use
   of propositions in general, including identity statements such as                           ‘Being is nothing’       or
   whether it concerns only subject-predicate propositions. To compound the problem, his
   comparison with          ‘ordinary proof ’      concerns a different difficulty altogether, the infinite
   regress threatened by the procedure of ‘grounding’ and ‘conditioning’—an ‘external cogni-
   tion’   that ignores the natural rhythm of the subject-matter. However, the point of this
   comparison is simply that both difficulties—the need to ground a proposition and Hegel’s
   need to use propositions at all—keep cropping up.
      In his account of the ‘dialectical movement’, Hegel uses the word ‘subject’ in at least two
   ways. In its first and third occurrences it designates the               ‘pure subject’, the active subject that
   keeps on the move, continually unfolding its essence; in its second occurrence it designates
   the   ‘underlying’      or  ‘static’  subject, which retains its meaning throughout a variety of
   predications. The pure subject is designated by a ‘name as name’. A ‘name’ usually involves
   two features. First, it refers to or identifies something, whether an individual or a species.
   Secondly, it achieves this identification by means of a ‘content’ or an explicit or implicit
   characterization of the item referred to. A              ‘name as name’        is a name with only the first of
   these features, not the second: it identifies something without presupposing or implying that
   it has any definite characteristics. The word ‘I’              is of this sort, since its use identifies the Self
   without presupposing or implying anything else about him (or her or it), apart from a
   capacity to use the word ‘I’. The word ‘God’ is a name, but an ‘authentic name’, not a ‘name
   as name’, since it carries too much representational and ‘edifying’ baggage with it. If the
   word ‘God’      does involve a ‘concept’, it does not do so ‘immediately’ but only in such a way
   that it needs to be unearthed from the representational trappings. Hegel seems to admit only
   two types of term into Logic: first, dummy subjects designating the ‘pure subject’ or ‘the
   empty unconceptual One [das leere begrifflose Eins]’, somewhat like ‘It’ in ‘It is raining’, and
   secondly, terms that immediately indicate concepts, such as                            ‘Being’, etc. It is mildly
   disconcerting to find ‘the One [das Eine]’ and ‘subject’                  occurring in both these lists. If this
   is not to be explained by the difference between ‘Eins’ and ‘Eine’, and between a ‘subject’ and
   a  ‘pure subject’, it might be explained in terms of the distinction between                                ‘use’  and
   ‘mention’: the       ‘It’ in  ‘It’s raining’    or terms used to designate the pure subject or the
   unconceptual One do not involve a concept, but the concept of the ‘weather “it” ’                                  is a
   perfectly good concept, and so is the concept of the subject and that of the unconceptual
   One. But      ‘speculative’     truths about God are marred by having a static rather than a
   conceptual content. Hegel often prefers to speak of ‘the absolute’ rather than ‘God’, and
   he sometimes presents the various stages of the ‘logical Idea’ as progressively more adequate
   definitions of the absolute, especially at significant turning-points in the Logic. In Enc. I, the
---
                                                                                                               

    absolute is successively defined as Being (¶¶85ff.), problematically as pure quantity (¶99), as
    essence (¶112), as the concept (¶160 Z), as the syllogism (¶181), as the object (¶194 Z), and
    finally as the Idea (¶213). However, most of the propositions of Logic dispense with a
    dummy subject.         ‘Being is nothing’, for example, or ‘The actual is the universal’                       have no
    explicit dummy subject.
¶67. 1. This returns to the          ‘inner intuition’ mentioned in ¶65, etc., which clearly requires no
    philosophical training (though inferences from this                    ‘foundation’      may well do so). On the
    comparison of philosophy with crafts, see also Enc. I, ¶5. The difference between a craft such
    as shoe-making and philosophy to which Hegel obliquely alludes is that one needs special
    training in order to make shoes, but not in order to assess them, whereas special training is
    required both for philosophizing and for evaluating philosophy. Hegel’s own philosophical
    training was deficient, albeit supplemented by genius and wide reading. There was a good
    logician at the Tübingen theological seminary he attended (1788–1793)—Gottfried Ploucquet
    (1716–1790)—but a recent heart attack prevented him from lecturing. Cf. Nietzsche, The
    Anti-Christ, ¶10: ‘One need merely say “Tübingen Stift” to understand what German phil-
    osophy is at bottom—an insidious theology’.
       Philosophizing requires not only training, but ‘information’ (Kenntnissen), since philoso-
    phy is not the purely formal discipline it is often taken to be, but also provides the rational or
    conceptual basis for the other sciences. In Enc. I, ¶16, Hegel explains that philosophy ‘forms
    one science, but it can also be considered as a whole made up of several particular sciences’,
    not as a mere ‘aggregate’ put together ‘contingently and empirically’, as they are in ordinary
    encyclopaedias, and excluding mere aggregates of information, such as possibly philology
    and certainly heraldry. But other sciences, such as jurisprudence,                            fiscal policy, natural
    history, geography, medicine, and history itself, all fall within the scope of philosophy, as
    far as their ‘rational beginning’ is concerned. Sooner or later, however, these sciences lapse
    into contingency. Precise decisions need to be made in jurisprudence and fiscal policy that
    can only be based on            ‘grounds’     or reasons (Gründe), not on ‘reason’ (Vernunft) or the
    concept. Nature eventually disperses into                ‘isolated contingencies’        and so too does history.
    But their rational foundation is enough to give them life, spirit, and truth. Hegel’s denial of a
    sharp distinction between philosophy and science helps to account for his use of the word
    ‘science’ for philosophy. Cf. PS ¶56.
¶68. 1. Education (Bildung) involves not only the education of the individual philosopher, but
    also the historical development of philosophy and other disciplines in which the individual
    must immerse himself before he can produce                    ‘genuine’    philosophy: see e.g. ¶2. Hegel con-
    siders two alternatives to it: ‘common sense’, which is ‘common’ to most people, and ‘genius’,
    which is the preserve of a few. They have in common that neither, supposedly, requires any
    special education, and so they both qualify as               ‘natural’   philosophizing. He turns to common
    sense in ¶69. ¶68 and focuses on genius, which includes the ‘immediate revelation of the
    divine’. Kant wrote: ‘Genius is a talent for producing something for which no determinate rule
    can be given, not a predisposition consisting of a skill for something that can be learned by
    following some rule or other’ (Critique of Judgement, ¶46). For Kant it remained an aesthetic
    concept, applicable to artists who had imaginative and intuitive access to aesthetic ‘Ideas’, but
    not e.g. to scientists, who are regarded as following rules. Genius displaced ‘taste’ as the source
    and criterion of aesthetic merit, especially in the               Sturm und Drang,         and later the romantic,
    movements. Both were in revolt against the rationalism of the enlightenment. See also Hegel
    (1993), pp.69ff. Schelling, as a close associate of the late 18th-century romantics, linked art with
    genius and made such declarations as that ‘art is paramount to the philosopher, precisely
    because it opens to him, as it were, the holy of holies, where burns in eternal and original unity,
    as if in a single flame, that which in nature and history is rent asunder, and in life and action, no
    less than in thought, must forever            fly apart’ (Schelling, 1978, p.231).

¶69. 1. Hegel now turns to the common sense philosophy mentioned in ¶68. Among others,
    he has in mind Wilhelm Traugott Krug (1770–1842), whom he attacked during his Jena
    period in the Critical Journal of Philosophy that he edited with Schelling. In the Introduction
    to the journal, Hegel wrote: ‘Philosophy is, by its very nature, something esoteric, neither
    made for the vulgar as it stands, nor capable of being got up to suit the vulgar taste; it only
    is philosophy in virtue of being directly opposed to the understanding and hence even
    more opposed to healthy common sense, under which label we understand the limitedness
    in space and time of a race of men; in its relationship to common sense the world of
    philosophy is in and for itself an inverted world’ (Di Giovanni and Harris, 1985, pp.282f.)
    His limitation of common sense to a particular time and place suggests that he is aware of
    the variability of common sense, but he overlooks the difference between common sense
    itself and a sophisticated defence of common sense, which need not be as naive as common
    sense itself. Kant himself, despite his criticisms of Thomas Reid , etc., aligned himself with
    common sense in his ‘open letter’ of 1799 against Fichte: ‘the Critique . . . is to be understood
    exclusively from the point of view of common sense, which only needs to be sufficiently
    cultivated for such abstract investigations’ (ibid., p.293). Common sense philosophy was
    especially associated with the Scottish philosophers, Thomas Reid (1710–1796), James
    Oswald (1703–1793), and James Beattie (1735–1803), whose works were translated into
    German by the mid-18th century. Reid appealed to sound ‘common sense’, even to the
    opinions of the ‘vulgar’, against such philosophical innovations as the ‘way of ideas’ that
    began with Locke and culminated in Hume’s scepticism. Reid’s Essays on the Intellectual
    Powers of Man (1785) was reviewed more favourably than Kant’s CPR by Johann Georg
    Heinrich Feder (1740–1821), who called Reid’s work ‘one of the most important products of
    speculative philosophy’. In return Kant, in his                 Prolegomena, attacked Reid, Beattie, and
    Oswald for their misunderstanding of Hume. Hegel’s objections to common sense philosophy
    are less than decisive: (1) If the doctrines defended by the philosopher are indeed generally
    accepted by commonsensical people, then they are in some sense ‘trivial’ and ‘insignificant’.
    The ‘effort of advancing’ such truths may be worthwhile, however, if, first, they have been
    disputed, plausibly, if not conclusively, by other philosophers, and, secondly, if the reader is
    not self-consciously aware of his commonsensical beliefs, and especially if he is inclined to
    accept the plausible attacks on them. It may come as a surprise to a reader of Locke to learn
    from Reid that the ordinary person really believes that he perceives objects directly, that he
    has believed this all along, and that his belief is tenable. (2) The common sense philosopher
    does hold that the beliefs he espouses are for the most part tacitly accepted by mankind.
    Hegel is also right to say that the ‘opposed truths’, e.g. that we directly perceive only ideas,
    etc., can also be ‘disclosed’ within commonsensical consciousness: otherwise the sceptic’s
    arguments would lack force for common sense consciousness. But he is wrong to imply that
    the appeal to common sense is the common sense philosopher’s only defence of his beliefs.
    Reid’s approach is two-pronged. He attempts to dismantle the sceptic’s arguments, hoping
    for victory, but in the case of a draw, common sense wins. (3) Common sense beliefs are for
    the most part held tacitly, located in the ‘heart’ or ‘feeling’ rather than rationally worked
    out. This does not entail that they are false, but—as Hegel says—they should be brought
    into the light of day. This, however, is surely what the common sense philosopher does.
    Making the beliefs explicit and defending them against sceptical attacks is not to leave them
    in the dark; to believe something after a sophisticated defence of it is an achievement of
    ‘cultivated reason’, and not the same as believing it unthinkingly. (4) It is not true that the
    common sense philosopher has nothing to say to his opponents. At the very least he can say,
    as G.E. Moore did, in          ‘A Defence of Common Sense’, that no philosophical argument
    could be more certain than his common sense conviction that e.g. he has two hands. He
    can also pick holes in the argument itself as well as doubting its soundness in general.

   A common sense philosopher is no more debarred from communicating with others and
   seeking agreement with them than any other philosopher. In fact it is not obvious that the
   existence of humanity requires as much ‘agreement’ as Hegel suggests. (5) The appeal to
   common sense alone, however, is not universally valid. At one time it was only common
   sense that the earth was flat, and in Reid’s day the existence of God was a matter of common
   sense. The appeal to common sense needs at least an additional criticism of sceptical
   arguments if it is to have force. (6) It is not obvious that Hegel’s own philosophy is
   wholly opposed to common sense. He often appeals to the wisdom stored up in ordinary
   language: ‘The forms of thought are first set out and stored in human language . . . So much
   is logic natural to the human being, is indeed his very nature. . . . [T]he German language
   has many advantages over other modern languages, for many of its words also have
   peculiarity of carrying, not just different meanings, but opposite ones, and in this one
   cannot fail to recognize the language’s speculative spirit’ (SL, p.12). Again, he often appeals
   to the affinity between his own idealism and religion: ‘This applies to philosophy just as
   much as to religion, for religion also . . . will not admit finitude as a true being, an ultimate,
   an absolute, or as something non-posited, uncreated, eternal’ (SL, p.124. Cf. SL, pp.508,
   528). In PS itself he is far more respectful of ordinary morality and of ordinary religion than
   he is of attempts to justify and refine them by philosophers and theologians inspired by
   understanding rather than reason. Hegel intended to arrive at this view of such matters that
   was in accord with the common sense of his day, but took a very un-commonsensical
   and roundabout route to get there. His achievement is not so much to dispose of
   common sense, but to unearth the logical complexity underpinning common sense. See
   also ¶131.
¶70. 1. The original ‘royal road’ was constructed from Susa to Sardis by Darius the Great in
   the 5th century .. to expedite transport across the Persian Empire. In his Commentary on
   the First Book of Euclid’s Elements, 68, Proclus says that when Euclid was asked if there was
   no shorter route to geometry than through the Elements, he replied that there was no royal
   road to geometry.
       2. The ‘empyrean’ was the highest region of heaven, believed in Graeco-Roman times to
   contain pure fire or light and regarded by some Christians as the abode of God.
       3. Hegel again attacks the two approaches to philosophy introduced in ¶68, each of
   which seeks a royal road to philosophy. As Yovel (2005), p.193, notes, Hegel exploits the
   ambiguity gemein (‘common’, i.e. ‘ordinary, vulgar’, but also ‘shared, common to all’) and
   ungemein (‘uncommon’, i.e. ‘extraordinary, not vulgar’, but also ‘not shared in common’).
   Common sense is common or ‘ordinary’, i.e. vulgar, while intuitive                         flashes of genius are
   uncommon or ‘extraordinary’, i.e. not common to all.
      It is clear enough why there is no royal road to geometry. Euclidean geometry begins with
   axioms and postulates. But unlike a journey along Darius’s royal road, it does not simply
   aim to reach a certain single conclusion or theorem from this starting-point. There are
   many theorems, arranged in a single logical framework, each established by a rigorous
   proof, ultimately based on the axioms and postulates. For the purposes of an architect it may
   be enough to know only one, or several, of the theorems, ignoring the proofs and the logical
   order of the theorems. But that will not make him a geometer, only an architect. Mutatis
   mutandis the same is true of Hegelian ‘science’, or indeed of any science. It is not simply the
   result that matters, but the way in which it is reached and the way in which it coheres with
   other results. This applies especially to the common sense philosophy. If Reid had listed
   only a series of commonsensical truths, such as ‘There is a world external to ourselves and it
   is roughly as we suppose it to be’, his work would be trivial. It is his arguments for such
   truths and his rebuttal of arguments against them that makes it worthwhile. This applies
   even more so to Hegel, believing as he did that concepts, shapes of consciousness, and

    aspects of the world form an orderly system such that our understanding of any one stage
    presupposes our understanding of its predecessors.
¶71. 1. In his dialogues Plato often illustrated the philosophical arguments (logos) of his
    interlocutors with a myth (muthos), often, though not invariably, a myth about the fate of
    the soul after death. Because these myths are pictorial and go beyond anything that could be
    established by rational argument, Hegel regards them as ‘scientifically worthless’. However,
    they were valued by Neoplatonists such as Proclus, who produced elaborate allegorical
    accounts of some of Plato’s myths. Hegel may also have had in mind such romantics as
    Friedrich Schlegel, who hoped for the creation of a                     ‘new mythology’         as a remedy for
    Germany’s cultural ills and said that ‘Plato’s philosophy is a dignified preface to future
    religion’. In an age when myths are preferred to conceptual thought, Hegel’s work is
    unlikely to appeal to many readers. However, there have been other ages when conceptual
    thought, as it is found in Aristotle and in Plato’s                  Parmenides       (a dialogue of immense
    difficulty but lacking in myth) were appreciated, especially by Proclus (412–485 ), who
    wrote a commentary on the              Parmenides, as well as on others of Plato’s works. Proclus
    might well be accused of ‘enthusiasm’ (Schwärmerei), given his interest in the theology of
    the Orphic and Chaldaean oracles and his practice of theurgy. Hegel is hard put to it to
    distinguish the      ‘enthusiasm’ and        ‘ecstasy’  he condemns in ¶7—in philosophers such as
    Schelling who were themselves influenced by Neoplatonism—from the                                ‘misunderstood’
    ecstasy that is the       ‘pure concept’. The Greek word                ekstasis, literally    ‘standing outside
    (oneself )’, was applied to any abrupt change of emotion or mood, as in being                                ‘beside
    oneself’ with joy, etc. However, it was later applied by Philo, etc. to religious experience, and
    by Plotinus to the mystical return of the Self to the One from which the world has descended.
    Hence Hegel regards genuine ecstasy as self-transcendence or absorption in conceptual
    thought.

¶72. 1. In former times, a single individual, such as Plato or Aristotle, could master almost all
    significant knowledge and make significant contributions to several spheres. Now that
    immensely more knowledge has been accumulated, the role of any single individual is less
    significant. This suggests that Hegel is presenting himself as a narrow specialist, which of
    course he was not. His role is rather that of an encyclopaedic generalist, presenting the
    achievements of others—past philosophies, shapes of consciousness, general concepts,
    etc.—in a logically rigorous system. This is one reason why the individual Hegel must
    ‘forget’ himself: he is just putting the finishing touches on an edifice built by many hands.
    The other is that a scientist, unlike, say, a poet, is simply following the intrinsic grain of his
    subject-matter.

Introduction
¶73. 1. The implicit completion of this thought is given at the end of the sentence: ‘we shall get
    hold of clouds of error, etc.’
      2. The     ‘absolute’ is equivalent to ‘what in truth is’             and to ‘that which is in itself ’, i.e.
    independently of its being cognized by us. Here it carries no peculiarly Hegelian presup-
    positions, but alludes obliquely to Kant’s ‘things in themselves’, as does the idea that our
    ‘cognition’    or cognitive equipment is an instrument or medium. (Cf.                           Enc. I, ¶10.) If
    cognition is an instrument or medium, it is reasonable to wonder whether it distorts our
    vision of the absolute, but not to conclude that it inevitably does so. An instrument or
    medium need not alter or distort the object to which it is applied: spectacles do not distort
    our vision, but enhance it. However, we cannot know whether such distortion has occurred,
---
                                                                                                           

    since we cannot remove our cognitive equipment to compare its findings with the object as
    it is ‘in itself ’. The instrument-hypothesis and the medium-hypothesis may correspond
    respectively to Kant’s view of the understanding as an active faculty that imposes concepts
    on our sensory input and to his view of sensibility as a passive faculty that receives sensory
    input through the media of space and time. But this distinction is of little importance here.
    In either case the anxiety (or ‘conviction’) is that cognition distorts reality, like a camera that
    produces distorted photographs.
      Kant offered no prospect of gaining access to the absolute by removing the distortion.
    This idea was proposed in Johann Heinrich Lambert’s New Organon, or Thoughts on the
    Investigation and Designation of the Truth and its Discrimination from Error and Illusion
    (1764). In a section entitled ‘Phänomenologie’ Lambert aimed to ‘avoid semblance (Schein)
    in order to penetrate to the truth’. Optics discovers laws of perspective enabling us to
    determine a thing’s nature from its visual appearance. This procedure can be extended to
    other appearances: sensory, psychological, moral, and ‘the probable’. Phenomenology is a
    ‘transcendent optics’ which discovers the ‘transcendent perspective’ by which each type of
    semblance is related to the truth, thus enabling us to determine the truth from the
    semblance and acquire a complete system of ‘scientific cognition’. Hegel objects that we
    cannot remove the distortion, the contribution of the instrument or the medium, without
    removing cognition altogether. This is problematic. It is easy to subtract                            mentally    the
    perspectival distortions of paintings and photos. But we can do so only because we have, in
    general, direct    access to objects and can compare them with their pictures. If our cognition
    gives rise to global distortion, then we cannot compare our ‘representations’ with the objects
    themselves to discover the laws of its ‘refraction’ and allow for any distortion.
      The correction of a distortion in our cognition also presupposes that we have an
    undistorted view of the distorted ‘representation’ of the absolute and can form the undis-
    torted thought that, say, the absolute is not spatio-temporal, even though our representa-
    tions portray it as such. Our knowledge of our representations, and our thoughts, must
    remain free of distortion. But why should they be, if in other respects our cognition is
    unreliable? This problem is connected with Hegel’s claim, in ¶74, that this scepticism
    ‘presupposes . . . a distinction between ourselves and this cognition’.
¶74. 1. If our cognition is wholly unreliable, then our belief that it is unreliable is also
    unreliable, since this belief is itself a product of it: cf. Hume,                      Enquiries     I, ¶116. The
    scepticism Hegel is attacking makes controversial assumptions. First, the ‘representations’
    of cognition as an instrument or a medium are not the only, or the obvious, way of viewing
    cognition. Secondly, these representations entail that I am distinct from my cognition, as a
    photographer is distinct both from the camera and the photos. Thirdly, cognition is
    separated from the absolute, as the camera and photos are distinct from the objects
    photographed. Hegel explicitly criticizes only the third of these. He may mean that since
    cognition is ‘real’, it must (like everything else) be an offshoot of the absolute. This does not
    entail that cognition is true or veridical. If Hegel suggests otherwise, he perhaps exploits the
    ambiguity ‘true’ (wahr) and ‘genuine’ (wahrhaft), which can mean ‘real, genuine’ as well as
    ‘veridical, correct’, as in ‘He truly believes that the earth is flat’. Illusions and errors, insofar
    as they are real, are also offshoots of the absolute, but that does not make them veridical. But
    see also ¶75.
¶75. 1. The ‘conclusion’ is the claim that his opponents have a ‘fear of truth’, that they have
    given up on truth and settle for a satisfying                  fiction. They reply that they allow for a
    distinction between truth and falsity within the realm of appearances. The Kantian or
    transcendental idealist affirms the truth of the proposition that the earth revolves around
    the sun, despite the fact that the sun and the earth, like everything else of which we have
    knowledge, are appearances, not things in themselves. The dependence of appearances on
---

   human cognitive equipment (especially space and time) does not mean that they are merely
   illusions: see CPR, B69: ‘When I say that the intuition of our objects and the self-intuition of
   the mind alike represent the objects and the mind, in space and in time, as they affect our
   senses, that is, as they appear [erscheint], I do not mean to say that these objects are a mere
   illusion    [Schein].’    Compare the way in which within                     fiction we can distinguish true
   statements, such as         ‘Sherlock Holmes smokes a pipe’, from false ones, such as ‘Sherlock
   Holmes is a non-smoker’. Whatever the merits of transcendental idealism, however, Hegel
   does not accept it without more ado.
¶76. 1. Hegel considers four alternatives: (1) To accept that cognition is cut off from the
   absolute (Kant). (2) To ‘struggle for answers’ within the terms of the problem itself (e.g.
   Lambert). (3) To disarm the problem by dismantling its confusions and obscurities. (4) To
   ignore the problem and proceed with                  ‘science’, in the hope that this will dispel it. Hegel
   rejects (1) and (2), but it is not clear which of (3) and (4) he favours. In PS he toys with (3):
   he examines the notion of the absolute in VI.B.II.a, ‘The struggle of enlightenment with
   superstition’. But examination of such notions in PS is for the most part oblique. It is
   conducted explicitly in Logic, which is a part of science proper, so that (3) converges with
   (4). However, procedure (4) faces the problem of equipollence—roughly, that if I say that p
   and you say that not-p, it is only my word against yours and your word against mine. In
   developing science we are confronted by its spurious rivals, ‘untrue knowledge’. How are we
   to establish the superiority of science over its competitors? It is no use simply confronting
   them with science in its finished form. This would be to pull rank on them, appealing to the
   sheer ‘Being’ of science; the rivals can do the same. Hegel’s response is to treat untrue
   knowledge not as rivals to science, but as incipient versions of it. Here he exploits the
   ambiguity of erscheinen, which corresponds closely to that of ‘appear’: ‘to seem’ (in potential
   contrast with reality), ‘to come to light, begin to exist’, etc. The ‘ideas and locutions’ opposed
   to science are only an           ‘empty appearance [Erscheinung] of knowing’, i.e. appear to be
   knowledge but are not really knowledge. When, by contrast, science comes                               ‘on the scene’,
   it is an ‘appearance’ in the sense of something that puts in an appearance; the contrast here
   is not with reality, but with the expansion of science ‘in its truth’, between science on its first
   appearance and science when it works itself out and justifies itself. When Hegel suggests that
   untrue knowledge might be called ‘its [viz. science’s] appearing’ (ihr Erscheinen), this is
   because untrue knowledge can be regarded as an incipient form of science, its                                       first
   ‘appearance’. Whether we regard untrue knowledge in this way or, alternatively, regard
   science as the appearance because it appears alongside a rival, the problem is the same:
   science must shed this         ‘semblance’, Schein, a word that unequivocally implies a contrast to
   reality. If untrue knowledge is regarded as simply an alternative to science, then science
   might simply reject it. But this does not work, since untrue knowledge can do the same. If
   untrue knowledge is regarded as an incipient form of science, as                           ‘its appearing’, science
   might appeal to the better ‘intimation’ in untrue knowledge, which is now called ‘cognition’,
   Erkennen, albeit not ‘genuine’ (wahrhaften), marking the fact that it is now regarded as an
   incipient form of science. It is harder to see why this alternative fails, especially since it
   resembles Hegel’s own procedure in PS. But this appeal is again to ‘a Being’, to a claim or a
   theory that simply happens to have been proposed. There is no guarantee that the theory is a
   fertile one and that the development of it will yield significant fruit. Moreover, an earlier
   version of a theory may be better than its successor. It is less clear why Hegel rejects an
   appeal to a     ‘form’   of itself that is explicitly characterized as ‘inferior’, etc. He may fear that
   such an appeal will encourage us to relapse into this inferior mode rather than to develop
   our theory further, i.e. to advance to science as it is              ‘in and for itself ’. For Hegel has clearly
   shifted from the view that science is trying to establish its superiority over competitors to the
   view that science emerges from inferior versions of itself. It is this relegation of rivals of
---
                                                                                                              

    science to the status of incipient versions of science that licenses Hegel’s enterprise, the
    presentation of ‘knowledge as it appears [des erscheinenden Wissens]’. The shift is facilitated
    by the ambiguity of erscheinen. Competitors of science are appearances in the sense of
    illusions, contrasting with reality. Incipient forms of science are appearances in the sense
    of science on its       ‘first appearance’, contrasting not with               ‘reality’   but with science in its
    developed form, as it is ‘in and for itself ’. Hegel’s own procedure is not the procedure that
    he began by criticizing. He does not first present science in its fully fledged form and then
    try to defend it against its rivals, either by arguing for it and against them, or by appealing to
    the ways in which they point in the direction of science. He rather exploits procedure (4), as
    he now interprets it, to justify his own different procedure. Since (4) appeals to intimations
    of science in other views, these other views are regarded as incipient versions of science. This
    appeal is illegitimate, but it shows us what we need to do. We should show how science
    emerges from more primitive modes of thought.
¶77. 1. Three types of knowledge are in play:                 ‘knowledge as it appears’, Hegel’s ‘presentation’
    of this knowledge, and science. Science, or at least Logic, is                        ‘free’  in the sense of self-
    determining, free of external, especially empirical, constraints. ‘Natural consciousness’ is
    not free in this sense. It is also confined, at any given stage, to a particular way of looking at
    things, to the exclusion of other ways. Science, by contrast, is not so one-sided, but
    incorporates and surveys all possible ways of looking things.                         ‘Knowledge as it appears’,
    the knowledge that natural consciousness has, is therefore distinct from science. This does not
    entail that the presentation of knowledge as it appears is distinct from science. Hegel and his
    readers are not confined to a particular viewpoint in the way that natural consciousness is.
       The ‘soul’     (Seele) is here roughly equivalent to              ‘natural consciousness’ and carries no
    special metaphysical baggage. In Enc. III, the ‘soul’ denotes our lower vital and psychological
    capacities, while      ‘spirit’ (Geist) denotes our intellectual and rational capacities. In                   Enc. III,
    three phases of spirit are distinguished:             ‘subjective spirit’     (the individual mind),         ‘objective
    spirit’  (our collective social and political life), and                  ‘absolute spirit’      (art, religion, and
    philosophy). This tripartite division does not explicitly occur in PS, where                        ‘spirit’  generally
    covers the realms later assigned to objective and absolute spirit, and excludes the realm of
    subjective spirit, which, insofar as it            figures in PS, is reassigned to the soul. The soul is
    correspondingly more intellectual than it is in Enc. III, since it traverses various                        ‘configur-
    ations’   (Gestaltungen), general ways of looking at things, before it becomes spirit and
    acquires complete self-knowledge. It remains unclear whether the journey of natural
    consciousness or the soul is a journey made by human beings over the course of history,
    a journey made by an individual over the course of its life, or a journey made by Hegel’s
    readers.
¶78. 1. Natural consciousness is the                 ‘concept’    of knowledge because it is only potential
    knowledge, not         ‘real’  or actual, i.e. fully       fledged knowledge. (It is similar to                 ‘untrue
    knowledge’ in ¶76, where             unwahr      means ‘untrue’, in the sense of              ‘not real’, as well as
    ‘incorrect’.) The concept in a seed or in a craftsman’s mind still awaits realization. Analo-
    gously, knowledge develops from a mere concept into real knowledge, science, and this
    requires the refutation and replacement of each stage of its growth by another, higher,
    stage—or, as Hegel sees it, by the self-refutation of an earlier stage and its metamorphosis
    into a later stage.
       Hegel considers three approaches: (1) Ordinary ‘doubt’ (Zweifel), where belief is eventu-
    ally restored. This is not at issue, since science regards                ‘knowledge as it appears’          as untrue
    and does not propose to resurrect it. (2) The (enlightenment) ‘resolution’                         to make up one’s
    own mind and accept nothing on authority, i.e. the ‘consciousness that gets down to its
    investigation     right away’: cf. Enc. I, ¶38 Remark. This makes little difference, since it need
    not alter the content of one’s opinions, and this will be the same as the untrue content of
---
      

   ‘knowledge as it appears’, unless the ‘education of consciousness . . . to science’ is complete.
   Only then can one find the truth on one’s own. (3) The way of doubt in the sense of ‘despair’
   (Verzweiflung), in which the supposed truths of ‘knowledge as it appears’                          are unmasked as
   the   ‘unrealized concept’, not the concept realized. It is a ‘self-accomplishing’ scepticism,
   since, in contrast to (2), the sceptical stance is not adopted by an individual external to the
   opinions under assessment, but by the opinions themselves, whose adherents come to see
   their intrinsic inadequacy. On scepticism, see also Enc. I, ¶39 Remark and ¶81 Addition 2.
¶79. 1. That the series of ‘forms of consciousness’ is complete, i.e. that no form of conscious-
   ness is omitted from Hegel’s survey, is supposedly guaranteed as follows. Each form of
   consciousness is refuted or negated, but this results in a new form of consciousness. Each
   form of consciousness (except the                first and the last) has one, and only one, immediate
   successor, and one, and only one, immediate predecessor. The forms are thus arranged like
   the natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, . . . n, except that the series ends in ‘absolute knowledge’. In
   counting, one might of course omit a number, but this cannot happen in the case of forms of
   consciousness, since each form metamorphoses into its successor of its own accord. This
   does not exclude the possibility of other forms of consciousness outside the series, or even of
   a whole series of forms related to each other in this way, but not so related to the forms that
   Hegel considers. Hegel needs other arguments if he is to exclude this possibility.
      Hegel said, in ¶78, that natural consciousness regards its fate as merely negative, when in
   fact it is positive too. Natural consciousness regards its opinions as true, when in fact they
   are untrue and their refutation is a necessary step on the way to truth. But the fact that
   refutation of error is necessary for the discovery of truth does not entail that the refutation
   of one error automatically generates the next error to be refuted, or the truth itself. So now
   Hegel adds that the negation of a form of consciousness is positive in that it immediately
   results in a new form of consciousness not yet negated. To regard a refutation as only
   negative is ‘one-sided’ and every form of consciousness is one-sided in this way. But the
   ‘knowledge which makes this one-sidedness its essence’                         is the scepticism considered in
   ¶¶202–6, which does not regard the upshot of its negation of one position as the emergence
   of a new position. Hegel’s argument for the view that negation is, or can be, determinate is
   that negation is negation of something determinate and is therefore itself determinate. This
   does not apply to standard negation. If we negate the determinate proposition                                  ‘God is
   yellow’, we obtain the relatively indeterminate proposition, ‘God is not yellow’ leaving a
   wide range of possibilities: that God has some other colour, that God is not coloured, or that
   God does not exist. Our negation does not tell us how to choose among these possibilities.
   So far, however, we have considered negation simply as a logical operation without regard to
   our actual negatings or denials. We usually have a reason for our denials and the reason
   often narrows the range of possible alternatives to the state of affairs denied: e.g.                              ‘God
   cannot be yellow, because he’s obviously white’ or ‘because God isn’t the sort of thing that
   can have a colour’ or         ‘because God doesn’t exist’. Similarly when a philosopher denies the
   truth of a doctrine, he usually advances some other doctrine in its place, which is deter-
   mined by his reasons for rejecting the first doctrine. Even a resolute sceptic has a doctrine:
   refusal to take a definite stance is a definite stance of refusal. However, even if negation is
   determinate in this sense, this still does not secure the                       ‘necessity’    of the progression.
   A proposition or a doctrine can be denied for a variety of reasons. To establish not only
   that each form of consciousness necessarily has one, and only one, immediate successor, but
   also that it could not possibly have a different immediate successor, Hegel would need to
   show that there can be only one reason for negating it.
¶80. 1. Sartre wrote:       ‘the waiter in the café can not be immediately a café waiter in the sense
   that this inkwell is an inkwell, or the glass is a glass’               (p.83). But in ¶2 Hegel compares the
   succession of philosophies to the growth of a plant, which is quite different from a glass or

                                                                                                              

    an inkwell. So it is not clear why, here, a natural entity cannot go beyond its immediate
    Being-there. Perhaps it is because a sapling cannot look ahead to what lies beyond its
    current stage of growth or because an acorn cannot become a beech. Unlike an acorn,
    consciousness is        ‘for itself its own        concept’. Consciousness always has an object, the
    ‘singular’    (dem Einzelnen). Consciousness itself is not singular in this sense, but universal.
    It is not essentially restricted to any given object, but can have any one of a range of objects.
    At any given stage it has a definite object, something ‘limited’, which fulfils the concept only
    inadequately, since consciousness is not intrinsically limited. Consciousness is not blin-
    kered, exclusively focused on its current object. It glimpses what lies beyond, if only beyond
    in space. Its concept impels it beyond its current object.
       Its ‘goal’ is the stage where concept and object ‘correspond’ to each other and where,
    therefore, consciousness need not go beyond its object, ‘beyond itself ’, because the object, as
    well as consciousness, is unlimited. This suggests that the goal is Hegel’s own standpoint,
    from which the whole series of earlier stages can be surveyed, both the forms of conscious-
    ness and their limited objects, objects which, collectively, are no longer limited, but cover
    the whole range of possible objects. But the goal also seems to include Logic, in which the
    mind confronts the logical structure that is the core of the mind itself, so that there is no
    longer any disparity between the mind (‘concept’) and its object.
       There are two sophisticated ways of avoiding the conceptually driven advance of con-
    sciousness. One is to          find everything       ‘good of its kind’, and so to opt for one form of
    consciousness and stick with it: cf. Enc. I, ¶13 on the problem of choosing a philosophy. But
    to be of one kind among others, i.e. limited, is itself a defect. The other way is to remain
    vainly, i.e. proudly but emptily, aloof from all forms of consciousness, as does the Romantic
    ironist, who ‘surveys everything, raises himself infinitely above everything conditioned, even
    above one’s own art, virtue or genius’              (Schlegel, p.148, translation modified).
¶81. 1. Knowledge as it appears is correct if, and only if, it conforms to the essence or the in-
    itself. The essence or in-itself is science itself. Hegel here tends to assume that the essence or
    in-itself is also the        ‘standard’, yardstick or criterion (Maßstab), whose application to
    knowledge as it appears will enable us to tell whether it is correct. (This assumption is
    mistaken—our criterion for diagnosing measles is not the essence of the disease itself—and
    Hegel later retracts, or at least qualifies, it.) The problem is that any such a standard will be a
    ‘presupposition’, a Voraussetzung, something posited                     ‘in advance’      (voraus) and not as yet
    justified. Science itself is available to us, or at least to Hegel, independently of its appear-
    ances, but it cannot yet justify its claim to be the essence rather than simply another
    appearance. Hence it cannot be used, without question-begging, as a standard for assessing
    knowledge as it appears, nor can it certify any other standard we might adopt.
¶82. 1. Consciousness is both distinct from and related (‘relates itself ’) to its object. Con-
    sciousness also (the active verbs seem to imply) regards itself as distinct from and related to
    the object. This relating is ‘knowing’            (Wissen, a word cognate with Bewusstsein, ‘conscious-
    ness’). But ‘we’ also believe that the object exists outside its relation to consciousness, as the
    ‘in-itself ’, and this is      ‘truth’, what the object really is independently of its relation to
    consciousness.       ‘We’   refers not only to Hegel and his readers, but to natural consciousness
    itself. The final sentence indicates that consciousness itself conceives its object in this way. It
    has a twofold conception of the object, as it is for consciousness and as it is in itself. These
    may well differ. Consciousness itself cannot be aware of any particular discrepancy, but it is
    aware of the possibility of a discrepancy.
¶83. 1. The model outlined in ¶82 is now applied to our investigation of knowledge itself.
    Knowledge has a view of its object that may not accord with the object in itself, the                            ‘truth’.
    ‘We’ (now Hegel and his readers) have a view of knowledge that may not accord with
    knowledge in itself, with the truth            ‘of ’ knowledge. But Hegel seems to use the word ‘truth’

   equivocally. The object of knowledge, say, atoms, is not usually true or false in the way that
   knowledge or beliefs are. What knowledge aims for is not the truth (or falsity)                              of  atoms,
   but the truth about         atoms, what atoms really are. Hegel, by contrast, wants to investigate
   not only the truth about knowledge, but the truth of knowledge, whether it is true or false.
   The truth or falsity of knowledge is a part of the truth about knowledge, but not the whole
   of the truth about it nor is it obviously the ‘essence’ of the knowledge. The                          ‘standard’ and
   the ‘essence’     or   ‘in-itself ’ here diverge: the essence or in-itself is apt for the truth about
   knowledge, a standard is appropriate for the assessment of the truth of                           knowledge. As in
   the case of first-order consciousness and its object, there may be a discrepancy between
   second-order knowledge and its object, first-order knowledge. But what worries Hegel is
   not that we might misconceive the truth                    about    knowledge, but that we might wrongly
   assess the truth       of knowledge or at least be unable to justify our assessment in the face of
   knowledge’s own assessment. We have our own standard of assessment, and knowledge
   may reject it.
¶84. 1. The      ‘separation’    is between the object itself and the standard in the investigator. The
   ‘presupposition’ is the investigator’s standard. Both are a ‘semblance’ (Schein), because they
   can be avoided. Consciousness has two conceptions of its object,                        first as it is for conscious-
   ness and secondly as it is in itself. There are two contrasting pairs of terms. First,                           ‘know-
   ledge’ contrasts with ‘the essence’ or               ‘the true’. Secondly, the essence or in-itself of the
   ‘object’   contrasts with the ‘object as object’, i.e. the object                 ‘as it is for an other’, viz. for
   consciousness. There is little difference between the questions: (1) ‘Does knowledge corres-
   pond to the essence or the true?’                 and (2)     ‘Does the object as it is for consciousness
   correspond to the essence or the in-itself of the object?’ They both amount to (3)                                 ‘Does
   knowledge correspond to the object as it really is?’                  In each of the contrasting pairs, Hegel
   regards one term as ‘the concept’ and the other as ‘the object’. In the first pair, knowledge is
   the concept, while the essence is the object, viz. the object in itself, or ‘that which is’. In the
   second pair, the order is reversed: the object as object is the object, while its essence or in-
   itself is the concept. So questions (1) and (2) can be rephrased respectively as (1a) ‘Does the
   concept correspond to the object?’ and (2a)                   ‘Does the object correspond to its concept?’
   These look much like the same question—apart from the direction-of-fit. But Hegel’s
   superimposition of the object-concept model on (1) and (2) is not pointless and innocuous.
   (1a) seems to ask whether a concept fits its object in something like the correspondence
   sense of truth. But this is not all, or even primarily, what Hegel means in calling knowledge
   the concept. In ¶78, ‘natural consciousness’ is said to be ‘the concept of knowledge’, viz. only
   potential knowledge, the concept of knowledge in the sense in which an acorn is only the
   concept of an oak. In ¶80 consciousness is said to be ‘for itself its own concept’, which
   therefore goes beyond its          ‘limited’ object in order to find an object that is adequate to itself.
   It is initially tempting to take (1) and (1a) as implying: knowledge is the concept of an
   object, O 1 , and the question is whether this concept corresponds to O1                         as O 1  really is. But
   according to ¶78, such knowledge is only the concept of knowledge. In order to realize itself
   as fully fledged knowledge it needs not only to find out what O 1 is really like, but to move on
   to the next stage, where its object is O 2 , and, according to ¶¶78 and 80, to continue the
   process until it eventually acquires an object that is no longer limited, but universal and
   adequate to itself. Each successive object is, like all such objects, limited, but also has an
   intrinsic defect that can be resolved only by advancing to the next object in the sequence. It
   is still unclear what standard consciousness uses to detect this defect.
¶85. 1. What is to be assessed is the object as it is for knowledge or consciousness. The concept
   that is the standard is not knowledge, but the essence or in-itself of the object, i.e. the object
   as it is in itself. So Hegel is here relying on questions (2) and (2a) implicit in ¶84. But two
   sentences on he gives a different account. Here he seems to have in mind questions (1) and
---
                                                                                                             

    (1a). What are to be compared now are the ‘object’ and consciousness ‘itself ’, which are
    equated respectively with ‘what to it is the true’ and ‘its knowledge of the true’. If ‘object’ and
    ‘what to it is the true’ refer to the object as it is for knowledge, then the comparison is futile,
    since the knowledge and the object as it is for knowledge are made to measure. So the object
    must be the object in itself and knowledge of the true must be knowledge of this object as it
    is for consciousness. Then the result of the comparison is not a forgone conclusion. The two
    items may correspond to each other or they may not. But now Hegel notes that the object as
    it is in itself is not accessible to us: we cannot get            ‘behind the scenes’. In response he insists
    that consciousness draws a distinction between the object as it is in itself and as it is for
    consciousness. This is so. But it is hard to see how a significant comparison between them
    can be made if, as Hegel admits, consciousness cannot get behind the scenes. The mistake is
    too obvious to be attributed without more ado to Hegel himself. So another interpretation
    might be this. The object is ‘for’ consciousness in two distinct ways. First, it has a conception
    of the object as it is known. Secondly, it has a conception of the object as it is in itself,
    independently of its being known. This second conception is now determinate, not empty.
    Suppose that consciousness believes that things in themselves consist of atoms too small to
    be perceived individually. Things as they are known by us, are quite different. They are
    perceptible, coloured, smelly, noisy, etc. in a way in which (as consciousness here views it)
    they cannot be in themselves. So consciousness has two (as it were) objects before it and can
    compare them. The result of the comparison is that the two objects differ. But so what? Why
    should we suppose that the way things present themselves to us is exactly the way they are in
    themselves? No doubt atomists need to explain, or at least leave open the possibility of
    explaining, how things can appear so different to us than they are in themselves and also
    how, given that this is so, we can nevertheless know, or have good reason to believe, that
    atomism is true. If it turned out that, if atomism were true, then we could not know it to be
    true or that, if atomism were true, then objects would not appear to us as they do, then
    atomism would have to be abandoned.
       This suggests that Hegel can appeal to an ambiguity in Wissen and ‘knowledge’. They may
    signify what is known, or alternatively the knowing of it. (Compare ‘The knowledge I have
    will convict him’ with ‘It happened without my knowledge’.) Our (way of) knowing may be
    at odds with our conception of the object. When Hegel speaks of testing our knowledge, he
    may have in mind, not testing what we claim to know, but testing our claim to know it, and
    thus generating arguments of the form ‘If p, then I/we cannot know that p’. This appears
    most conspicuously in his account of sensory certainty (¶¶90–110). Sensory certainty has a
    determinate view of how objects are in themselves. They are individual. It therefore
    attempts to pick them out as sheer immediately knowable individuals, with no universal
    intermediary. It cannot do this, however. The terms it employs (‘this’, ‘here’, ‘now’, etc.) to
    pick out the supposed individuals turn out to be universal terms and, for this reason, unable
    to pick out an individual. It also becomes clear from this case that both sides of the equation
    must be abandoned, immediately knowable individuals, along with the immediate knowing
    of them. The standard changes along with the knowing.
¶86. 1. This is the       first occurrence of the word ‘dialectic(al)’ in PS, outside the Preface. As in
    the Preface, dialectic is associated with movement. The word originated from the Greek for
    ‘discussion’ or ‘dialogue’, and in Plato’s early works, dialectic essentially involves a dialogue
    between two or more persons. However, in Plato’s later works, interpersonal dialogue
    becomes more perfunctory and inessential. Hegelian dialectic does not involve interper-
    sonal dialogue, in particular not a dialogue between Hegel and the shape of consciousness
    under consideration. If any dialogue is involved it is a dialogue between a shape of
    consciousness and itself. As Hegel implies, his main point here is not new, but a clarification
    of what he has said earlier. Consciousness has two objects, the in-itself and the                         ‘Being-for-
---
      

    consciousness of this in-itself ’, i.e. its own knowledge of the in-itself. If this second object is
    taken simply as the         ‘reflection of consciousness into itself ’, then it does not represent an
    object, but only      ‘its knowledge’      of the first object. Suppose, for example, that the first object
    is a world of immediately apprehended sensory individuals, then the second object will be
    my knowledge of (what I know about) a world of immediately apprehended sensory
    individuals. No correction, no advance, can be made, because there is no tension between
    the first and the second object; they fit together like a hand and a glove. The tension arises if
    I realize that my knowledge (my knowing) of such individuals is conducted in universal
    terms, and therefore conflicts with my original conception of the first object and of the way
    in which it can be known. Then the second object, my knowing, can take its place as the in-
    itself, that is, as the first or primary object of the next shape of consciousness. Whether it is
    fit for this purpose is a distinct question, but at least it is different from the first object: my
    knowing of X is different from X in a way that my knowledge of X (in the sense of what
    I know about X) is not different from X.
¶87. 1. On the usual view of experience (cf. ¶79 on traditional scepticism) we discover the
    falsity of our belief or theory by encountering a different state of affairs with no intrinsic
    connection with the belief or theory that it falsifies. Nothing is left to consciousness but the
    ‘pure apprehension’         of its new object. When, e.g., my conviction that all swans are white is
    falsified by the black swan I happen to see, I do nothing except ‘apprehend’                           the black swan
    and realize that it falsifies my previous belief. On Hegel’s account, by contrast, the new
    object is simply our knowledge of the first object. Hegel is mistaken in suggesting that the
    correctness of his conception is guaranteed by the fact that the falsification and abandon-
    ment of a belief is a ‘result’ of the belief itself. After all, my belief that not all swans are white
    is, at least in part, the result of my prior belief that all swans are white. But the result of the
    falsification may leave me with no definite view of the colours that swans might have. I now
    know that some are white and some are black, but for all I know there may be others that are
    green, red, and so on. The most that Hegel is entitled to claim is that the result of a falsified
    belief is itself a definite belief in cases where the falsification stems from a mismatch between
    my belief and my knowing.
       Here, for the first time, Hegel draws the important distinction between what is known by ‘us’,
    Hegel and his readers, and what is known by the shape of consciousness under consideration at
    any given stage. Any given shape of consciousness is aware of its object and of its way of
    knowing its object. It also becomes aware of the tension between its object and its way of
    knowing the object, and of the consequent collapse of its object. But it is not aware of the
    transformation of its object (or rather of its way of knowing this object) into a new object.
    Equally, the new shape of consciousness that emerges from it is not aware of the manner of its
    emergence or of the fact that its object has emerged from its predecessor’s way of knowing. The
    knowledge of each shape of consciousness is confined to itself and does not extend to the
    movement from one shape to another or the engine that drives this movement. This limitation
    of each shape of consciousness is not based on empirical observation, but on Hegel’s stipulative
    restriction of the intellectual resources of each shape of consciousness. This is essential, if there
    are to be distinct shapes of consciousness at all. If each shape knew everything that Hegel
    knows, then it would not be distinct from its successor, since it would know its successor’s
    object as well as its own; it would have to be in possession of much, if not all, of Hegel’s
    philosophical equipment and therefore be close to the end of PS right at the beginning.
    that any given shape, Sn , can be immediately followed only by a particular successor, Sn+1,
                                                                                                The ‘necessity’ of the sequence of shapes (cf. ¶79) is stronger than deductive necessity in
    and by no other, whereas a proposition entails any of infinitely many propositions, none of
    which has priority over the others. It is more like the necessity of the sequence of natural
    numbers, where, if we begin with 1 and repeatedly apply the operation ‘+1’, each term in the

    series is guaranteed to have a specific immediate successor. This does not guarantee the
    necessity of any temporal or historical sequence. An individual or group that is currently at
    the stage of, say, sensory certainty, may well remain at this stage or pass on to a different
    shape than perception, owing to weariness, intellectual deficiency or whatever, just as
    someone may miscount or stop counting altogether.
¶88. 1. Heidegger (1970) argues that PS is not only an introduction to science for the
    uninitiated, but is science itself. However, he bases this on his (incorrect) belief that in
    the Introduction Hegel presupposes the view of the absolute with which he believes PS to
    conclude: cf. ¶73 and Inwood (2013). Hegel agrees that PS is not only an introduction to
    science, but science itself. However, he does so for the quite different reason that the
    transitions from one shape of consciousness to the next are                    ‘necessary’. This does not entail
    that a glimpse of the absolute, of the conclusion of the whole sequence, is presupposed by
    Hegel’s account of the movement of the sequence. Hegel’s conviction that PS is science, as
    well as an introduction to science, helps to account for its inclusion in                    Enc. III, ¶¶413–39: if
    PS is science it must appear within the exposition of science. This is facilitated by the new
    ‘introduction’     with which Hegel begins his Encyclopaedia.
¶89. 1. See also ¶¶77 and 80. Hegel uses               ‘experience’ not in the sense in which it signifies the
    acquisition of knowledge, or the knowledge acquired, through sense-perception in contrast
    to reasoning. It has more the flavour of a ‘voyage of discovery’, the encounter with new
    places, events, and people. PS has often been compared with a                           Bildungsroman, such as
    Goethe’s     Wilhelm Meister, a novel about the formative years of a person in which his
    character, knowledge, and wisdom develop owing to his experiences. As in ¶79, Hegel
    claims that his account of consciousness or of spirit will be complete, but only in the form of
    ‘shapes of consciousness’, not in the form of such abstract concepts as Being, etc. which will
    constitute the subject-matter of Logic.                ‘Consciousness’        in Hegel’s usage, is essentially
    consciousness of an object which it conceives as distinct from itself. Thus he tends not to
    regard our thought about abstract concepts as consciousness, since such concepts are not
    distinct from the thinker. In contrast to ‘consciousness’ in the narrower sense, in the usage
    of PS, ‘spirit’ is collective and interpersonal, ‘I that is We, and We that is                  I’ (¶177). It comes
    into its own in chapter VI, whereas consciousness in the narrower sense is confined to
    chapters I–III. In a wider sense, however, ‘consciousness’                   also includes the realm of spirit,
    since it is consciousness that arrives at the culmination of PS. Hegel describes this culmin-
    ation in various ways:
    (1) Knowledge finds itself and does not need to go beyond itself (¶80).
    (2) The concept and the object correspond to each other (¶80).
    (3) Consciousness is its own concept and it goes beyond what is limited, i.e. beyond itself (¶80).
    (4) Consciousness sheds its alien material, i.e. the object that is conceived as distinct from
         itself (¶89).
    (5) The appearance becomes equal to the essence and so the presentation of it intersects the
         authentic ‘science of spirit’ (viz. the science to which PS is an introduction) at this point
         (¶89).
    (6) Consciousness grasps this essence of itself and signifies the nature of absolute know-
         ledge (¶89).
      According to Hegel’s prospectus, PS was to be followed by a work on logic, nature, and
      mind (Geist). It is not clear whether his descriptions of the culmination of PS refer to the
      Logic alone or to science proper as a whole, in particular the ultimate conclusion of his
      enterprise, the end of his account of mind, which is an account of philosophy itself. Even
      when consciousness has shed its alien object (4) and embarked on (or given way to)
      science proper, the study of logic, nature, and mind, it is still the case that knowledge needs
---
     

     to  ‘go beyond itself ’, since it proceeds through logic, nature, and mind by a dialectic
     similar to that by which consciousness proceeds through the various shapes of conscious-
     ness. It may be, therefore, that when Hegel speaks of the ‘goal’                    in ¶80 he has in mind the
     ultimate conclusion of his system, where knowledge no longer needs to go beyond itself
     (1). But in ¶89 he seems to focus on the transition to logic, since it is in this transition that
     consciousness sheds its alien object (4). Moreover, he speaks of PS as coinciding with the
     science of spirit at a certain point (5), a point which is presumably not the final conclusion
     of science. However, since claim (6) is marked as distinct from claims (4) and (5) by the
     word    ‘finally’, claim (6) may pertain to the conclusion of the system as a whole. What
     seems indisputable is that by the end of PS consciousness is, first, no longer ‘limited’ to a
     particular object or to a particular shape and that it can range over all the objects and
     shapes that have appeared in PS, and, secondly, that it is in a position to embark on logic
     and to consider the abstract concepts that rarely figure explicitly in PS but which underpin
     its movement.

A. Consciousness
I. Sensory Certainty: The This and Meaning
¶90.    In the subtitle ‘Meaning’ translates das Meinen, the nominalized infinitive of the verb
   meinen, which means both ‘to believe, think, opine’ and also ‘to mean’ in such phrases as ‘to
   mean well’ and ‘did you really mean it?’. Thus meinen and its derivatives might equally well
   be translated as ‘opine, etc.’. But ‘mean(ing)’ has the advantage of capturing Hegel’s pun on
   the similarity between mein, ‘my’, and meinen in ¶100, though the disadvantage of being
   easily confused with other, quite different senses of                ‘mean(ing)’. No translation of meinen-
   words can keep pace with Hegel’s wordplay. See also ¶63.
      1. In this paragraph Hegel makes three claims: (1) Sensory certainty is the immediate, i.e.
    first, object of the philosopher. (2) Sensory certainty’s knowledge is immediate and un-
    conceptual. (3) The philosopher’s account of sensory certainty should be unconceptual
    and/or keep conceptualization out of sensory certainty. (1) Does not entail (2). (3) Is
    ambiguous. It might mean that we should not attribute to sensory certainty a conceptual-
    ization that is not available to it. (This applies to all shapes of consciousness: we should
    describe them as they are, without alteration.) Or it might mean: we should not deploy
    concepts in our examination of it—a prohibition that Hegel                           flouts, when he mentions
    ‘Being’, the first concept of his Logic.
¶91. 1. Why does consciousness need to individuate singular entities rather than simply
   gesture towards its surroundings as a whole? It is only when consciousness focuses on a
   singular entity that it can regard itself as a singular I, distinct from and parallel to, rather
   than absorbed in, its surroundings. Throughout chapters I–III, the Self is harnessed to a
   specific type of object, and views itself in terms of its specific type of object. Its conception of
   itself changes with its conception of its object. The Self and its object play complementary
   roles, like dancing partners.
¶92. 1.   ‘Exemplifying by-play’         translates ‘Beispiel’, which ordinarily means ‘example, model’,
   but Hegel exploits its supposed derivation from ‘bei’ and ‘Spiel’ (‘play’). The byplay is the
   complex ‘mediation’         from which the simple indexicals emerge.
      2. The I and its object are interdependent, i.e. each is mediated by the other.
¶93. 1. But sensory certainty does not regard the I and its object as of equal status. It begins by
   taking the object to be the essential thing, the active party. The object would exist even if
   I did not. It would exist even if it were not known by me. I know the object because of what
   the object is; the object is not as it is because            I know it.

¶95. 1. Hegel here conflates ‘now’ (jetzt) as an adverb with                      ‘the Now’      (das Jetzt) as a noun-
    phrase. To the question ‘What (time) is it now?’ an appropriate answer might be ‘Now it is
    night-time’. To the question ‘What is the Now?’ an appropriate answer would be ‘The Now
    is the present time (or instant)’. A similar conflation occurs in his treatment of ‘I’, ‘this’, and
    ‘here’. But Hegel is also intrigued by the deeper, less obviously linguistic, problems about
    time and the persistent present raised by Aristotle (Physics, IV.10–14): see Inwood (1991).
¶96. 1. Indexical or demonstrative terms, such as                    ‘this’, ‘now’, ‘here’, and ‘I’ may, in appro-
    priate circumstances, be applied to anything, any time, any place, etc., and are in this sense
    universal. The sense of such a term is dependent on and thus ‘mediated’ by the variety of its
    applications. Since indexicals are indispensable for referring to singular entities or individ-
    uals, at least in the meagre vocabulary assigned to sensory certainty, singular entities can
    only be referred to in universal terms.
¶97. 1. Here meinen and Meinung are in play. Hegel does not simply presuppose the truth-
    fulness of language. If he were to do that, it would be open to sensory certainty to reply that
    the fault lies with language, since it is an inadequate vehicle for our ‘meaning’. He has tried
    to establish the truthfulness of language by his experiment with the underlying logic of time in
    ¶¶95f. It is unclear, however, what conclusion he draws from this. Here he seems to say that
    we can never refer to a singular entity. But the most he is entitled to claim is that we cannot
    refer to a singular entity in the meagre vocabulary at the disposal of sensory certainty.
¶98. 1.    ‘Here’, like ‘now’, is an indexical. There is a sense in which everywhere is here, just as it
    is always now. But this does not give rise to problems of space and the ubiquitous Here,
    comparable to those of time and the persisting Now. The problem with ‘here’ seems more
    obviously linguistic than the problem with ‘now’, and therefore less apt for confirming the
    truthfulness of language.
¶99. 1. The upshot of sensory certainty’s experience so far is pure Being, an abstraction
    emerging from the negation and mediation involved in the Now and the Here, rather
    than the immediate Being that sensory certainty                   meant. Pure Being is the first category of
    Hegel’s Logic, where it is shown to veer into pure Nothing: see                       Enc. I, ¶¶86f.
¶100. 1. Sensory certainty is now driven to reverse the relative positions assigned to knowing
    and the object in ¶93. The knowing I is now the essential, active party.
¶101. 1. This reversal acknowledges all the work done by the I in its attempt to pick out the
    object, and provides another way of picking it out, viz. by reference to the I itself. Then
    Hegel notes that ‘I’        is itself an indexical, applicable to everyone, and so cannot be used
    to refer to anyone in particular. However,               ‘I’ is different from ‘this’,     ‘here’, and ‘now’. Once
    we know who is using the word ‘this’, we still may not know what is referred to. But once we
    know who is using the word                ‘I’, we know who is referred to. On the peculiarity of                      ‘I’,
    see further Chisholm (1981).
¶102. 1. The I (or the word ‘I’) is ‘universal’ in two distinct ways. First, the I is not inseparably
    attached to any particular state or object: one and the same I can see a house, a tree, or
    neither. Secondly, everyone is an I: the word ‘I’ is applicable by everyone to him- or herself.
    The first sentence seems to refer to the first type of universality, but Hegel’s primary concern
    is the second. The final sentence refers obliquely to Wilhelm Traugott Krug’s challenge to
    the new idealists to deduce the pen he is writing with: see Di Giovanni and Harris (1985),
    pp.292–310. The challenge would be illegitimate if it were impossible to refer to Krug’s pen,
    and even for Krug to refer to himself.
¶103. 1. The I and the object are now in the same boat. I can only refer to the object by way of
    referring to myself. And I can refer to myself, if at all, only by referring to something in my
    vicinity. So the I and the object have to go together, neither more essential than the other.
¶104. 1. Sensory certainty now focuses exclusively on the sensory situation of me-here-now,
    refusing to consider any other I, Here, or Now. The collaboration of all three indexicals
---
     

   facilitates this: sensory certainty need not turn away from a tree here and now to see a house,
   since the house will be seen later, not now; it need not consider any other I, since any other
   I will be not here now, but elsewhere.
¶105. 1. Self-certainty is now pointing or showing, rather than speaking the language that got
   it into trouble earlier. Hegel must assume its own first-person standpoint here and now, not
   describe its situation later or from somewhere else. Once he has assumed this standpoint,
   however, the Now must be pointed out to him, so that he can focus on it as well as sensory
   certainty does.
¶106. 1. Hegel is here playing with the cognate words ‘gewesen’, the past participle of ‘sein’ (‘to
   be’), hence also      ‘having been, former, ex-’), and           ‘Wesen’    (‘essence’, but also a ‘being’). The
   present moment is         fleeting and disappears as soon as one points it out.
¶107. 1. The momentary Now,                 first pointed out, has passed or is sublated. But sensory
   certainty sublates this sublation and insists that it is still Now now. This is because ‘now’
   does not only, or even usually, designate the present instant, but a period of time, of variable
   length, that includes the present instant but much else besides. Any extended period that
   counts as Now consists of many shorter Nows, and each of the shorter Nows consists of
   even shorter Nows, and so on. Hence any Now pointed out is a complex of Nows reduced to
   simplicity. In ¶¶95f. the Now was universal because any time is now when it is present. Here
   the Now is universal because the Now or the present is indefinitely expandable and
   contractable. (This point does not depend on the indexicality of                       ‘now’: it is equally true of
   a  ‘thing’  or ‘object’   that it consists of many things or objects.)
¶108. 1. What is true of the Now also applies, mutatis mutandis, to the Here.
¶109. 1. Sensory certainty may be its ‘history’ (Geschichte), but it is clear from this ¶ that Hegel
   does not associate it with any particular phase of the history of humanity. It is rather an
   artificial construct, but approximates to an outlook that we, philosophers and non-
   philosophers alike, are constantly tempted to adopt. Hegel’s conclusion here, that sensory
   things are intrinsically nothing and deserve only to be consumed, goes way beyond his
   arguments so far, even if we regard these arguments as sound. Our inability to refer to a
   singular sensory thing has little bearing on the reality of types of sensory thing. Wordsworth
   marvelled at a host of golden daffodils, and no doubt at any other daffodils he came across,
   not at any singular daffodil in particular; a dog eats a singular bone, but not as this bone,
   only as some bone or other. See also ¶110.
¶110. 1. It is unclear what Hegel thinks he has shown. Some of the alternatives, in order of
   descending strength, are these:
   (1) There are no singular (sensory) entities/Sensory entities are nothing (cf. ¶109).
   (2) We cannot pick out or refer to a singular entity. (This is implied by our inability to refer
         to this bit of paper in ¶110.)
   (3) We cannot pick out or refer to any singular entities using only the limited resources
         assigned to sensory certainty. (This may be true, but does not account for our inability
         to refer to this bit of paper.)
   (4) We, even sensory certainty, can pick out a singular entity, but only by using, among
         other things, universal terms. (This is quite likely true, but it conflicts with Hegel’s
         disparagement of Meinung.)
   (4) Is the most reasonable conclusion to be drawn from Hegel’s arguments and it also
   supplies what he needs to ‘sublate’ sensory certainty. Its object in itself is (conceived as) a set
   of singular entities. Its knowledge of the object, by contrast, depends on universals. So there
   is a mismatch between the object in itself and the knowledge of it, and this mismatch is
   present to consciousness. So sensory certainty cannot fulfil its own requirement that its
   knowledge be immediate, with nothing, let alone anything universal, intruding between
---
                                                                                                             

    itself and the object. This modest (and charitable) interpretation leads naturally into the
    next shape of consciousness, perception, if we add that for an object to be identifiable in
    universal terms it must have an intrinsic universal aspect, not being only a This, but also
    having properties that are potentially shareable by an indefinite number of objects.                                 ‘To
    perceive’    is ‘wahrnehmen’, which Hegel treats as a compound of                          ‘wahr’    (‘true(ly)’) and
    ‘nehmen’ (‘to take’), and thus as meaning ‘to take [something] truly, as it truly is’. His eulogy
    of language is hyperbolic. His arguments are not exclusively linguistic: cf. ¶97. Nor,
    presumably, did he recognize his wife from a unique definite description of her.

II. Perception: The Thing and Illusion
¶111. 1. Hegel has two points in mind: (i) In sensory certainty, the two moments, the I and its
    object, do not develop out of something else, whereas in perception they do. (‘Appear,
    appearance’ here have the flavour of ‘appearing out of the blue’, in contrast to ‘emerge,
    emergence’ (entstehen) from something else.) (ii) In sensory certainty the I and its object
    fall outside     each other,      whereas in perception they emerge from the same thing, the
    pointing-out.
        2. As in the case of sensory certainty, the object and subject are viewed in corresponding
    terms (see ¶91), and initially the object is essential, and the subject inessential (cf. ¶93).
¶112. 1. Hegel uses ‘universal’ liberally: the object of perception is universal in that it has many
    properties. Perception does not simply supplant sensory certainty. It incorporates the
    sensory    ‘wealth’ that sensory certainty gestured towards but could not digest. Hegel has
    the  concept expressed by his later use of aufheben (‘abolish–preserve–elevate’), even if he
    does not often use the word           in this way yet: but see ¶113.
¶113. 1. A thing is a universal medium for many properties, e.g. salt that is white, tart, etc.
    Each property is itself universal, since it is potentially shareable with other things. But until
    the end of ¶114, Hegel speaks of ‘thinghood’ (Dingheit) rather than ‘thing’ (Ding), since it is
    only in the context of other things that thinghood is individuated into a thing. The
    properties are ‘indifferent’ to each other, related only by an ‘Also’ (the nominalization of
    auch,   ‘also’). They do not compete for space in the thing: salt is white and tart throughout,
    whereas it could not be white and black throughout.
¶114. 1. To be a determinate property, e.g. white rather than simply colour, a property must
    negate and be negated by different properties, e.g. black. Hegel is here influenced by
    Spinoza’s dictum, omnis determinatio est negatio (Letter 50). This cannot take place within a
    single thing, since properties that negate each other are incompatible: nothing can be black and
    white throughout. So another thing is needed with properties incompatible with those of the
    first thing, but similarly compatible with each other, e.g. sweet, brown chocolate. Owing to the
    presence of other things, the first thing ceases to be merely thinghood, a medium for properties,
    and becomes a unitary thing, excluding other things and their opposing properties.
¶115. 1. Within the passive universality or medium, properties are relatively independent and
    loosely related to each other. In the science of Hegel’s time, they are regarded as ‘matters’,
    such as heat-matter, electrical-matter, etc., that occupy pores in the thing: see                                  Enc.
    I, ¶¶125–30. In the unitary thing, by contrast, properties are tightly integrated into the
    thing, enabling it to exclude other things with their competing properties. There is a tension
    between these two views of the thing and its properties. Somehow the unity of the thing needs
    to be maintained along with the diversity of its properties.
¶116. 1. The illusion to which perceiving is susceptible is not primarily ordinary perceptual
    illusions (such as seeing a stick in water look bent, when it is really straight), but an
    intellectual apprehension that fails to maintain its internal coherence or the ‘equality-to-
    itself ’ (Sichselbstgleichheit) of the thing. However, perception is susceptible to ordinary
---
      

    perceptual illusions of a sort that sensory certainty was not, since perception opens up a gap
    between itself and its object that was not present in sensory certainty.
¶117. 1. That is, ein Meinen, a relic of sensory certainty.
        2. Hegel replays the tensions that he discerned in perception in ¶¶113–15, but now as
    they present themselves to consciousness itself. It vacillates between regarding the thing
    as a medium or ‘community’ for its properties and regarding it as an intrinsic unity,
    whose properties are shared with and/or contrast with those of other things. It attributes
    its difficulties not to the internal incoherence of the thing, but to its own misapprehen-
    sions. It is in danger of lapsing back into the unarticulated ‘sensory Being’ of sensory
    certainty.
¶118. 1. In ¶100 sensory certainty tried to resolve its difficulties with the object by bringing
    itself, the I, into the equation. Perception now does the same, only in a different way. In its
    initial apprehension of the thing it finds two conflicting aspects, the unity of the thing and
    the diversity of its properties. It therefore unloads one of these aspects onto itself, the
    perceiver, and thereby removes the conflict from the thing. It corrects its initial view of the
    thing and arrives at a reflective, coherent view of it.
¶119. 1. Consciousness can effect this manoeuvre because the subject, the perceiver, is con-
    stituted as the mirror-image of the object, the thing. As the thing was initially seen as a
    medium for diverse properties, so the subject is now seen as medium for diverse sense-
    organs, each of which perceives the thing in a different way. The thing is now an intrinsic
    unity, apparently diversified only by our sense-organs.
¶120. 1. However, the thing needs its diverse properties in order to differentiate itself from
    other things. So it lapses back into being a medium for diverse properties.
¶121. 1. Consciousness is aware that, like the thing, it too is a single unity as well as a
    collection of sense-organs. This unity of its own enables it to reverse its previous procedure.
    Instead of assigning the thing’s diversity to itself and allowing it to retain its unity, it
    now unloads the unity of the thing onto the perceiving subject and allows the thing to retain
    its diversity. To ensure that the properties really are diverse, it regards them as ‘free matters’:
    cf. ¶115.
¶122. 1. Consciousness alternates, taking itself as an ‘Also’                     and the thing as       ‘One’    and, con-
    trariwise, itself as ‘One’ and the thing as an ‘Also’. It then realizes that the thing really is both
    diversity (Also) and reflection into itself (One) and that neither aspect can be unloaded onto
    consciousness itself.
¶123. 1. Consciousness abandons its earlier strategy (¶¶116, 118f.) of preserving the thing’s
    coherence or       ‘equality-with-itself ’ by taking one of its contradictory aspects upon itself,
    regarding it as an illusion it imposes on the thing. It now regards the thing as intrinsically
    unitary, while its apparent diversity is inflicted on it by its relations with other things.
¶124. 1. However, the second thing, which supposedly has this effect on the first thing, is not
    simply an external irritant. It is in the same position as the                  first thing; it too is a One whose
    Also is to be aroused by the            first thing. So where does this Also, within each thing, come
    from? It can only arise if each thing has, in addition to its unity, an intrinsic susceptibility to
    diversification as a result of its relations with another thing. Each thing therefore involves an
    internal distinction between its unity and its diversifiability. It is thus not the harmonious
    unity consciousness postulated. The claim that while its unity is essential to it, its diversity is
    inessential, is effectively withdrawn, if we add that the diversification or                        ‘manifoldness’       is
    necessarily    in the thing.
¶125. 1. A thing has an ‘absolute character’ (cf. ¶124) in virtue of which it is independent (‘for
    itself ’) and opposed to other things. But this opposition to other things means that it is
    essentially related to them and thereby loses its independence. (E.g. a human body would
    explode if the surrounding atmosphere were removed.)
---
                                                                                                             

¶126. 1. A thing negates other things, but it cannot eliminate them entirely without elimin-
    ating itself (like the bird that thinks it could fly faster if the atmosphere that impedes it were
    removed altogether).
¶127. 1. To regard a thing’s diversity as ‘necessary’ but not ‘essential’                        is to draw an empty
    distinction.
¶128. 1. The expression ‘insofar’ (insofern) is used—much like ‘also’—to separate one feature
    from another: cf. ¶121 (‘insofar as it is white, it is not cubical’) and ¶124. But the device fails. It is
    impossible to distinguish between a thing’s intrinsic character and its relations to other things.
¶129. 1. The thing collapses because of the residue of sensory certainty it contains. Its
    universality stems directly from the sensory and is therefore conditioned by it and not
    harmonious but divided into a singular unity and the universal Also. These amount to
    Being-for-itself and Being for others. They are essentially unified and thus constitute a
    universality that has broken free of dependence on the sensory and therefore belongs to the
    realm of the understanding rather than perception.
¶130. 1. A summary of the preceding ¶¶.
¶131. 1. Hegel is not recommending that we give up perceiving things and making perceptual
    claims about them. The expression ‘perceptual understanding’ rather indicates that he is
    concerned with the philosophical difficulties that arise when we reflect upon perception, in
    particular the relationship between a thing and its properties. In the hands of bluff common
    sense   ‘Being’, ‘singularity’, ‘universality’, etc. are indeed mere abstractions, Gedankendinge,
    but such thoughts, properly conceived, form the underlying structure of our everyday
    attitudes towards things. If we do not submit them to a proper logical investigation,
    their interconnections and permutations play fast and loose with us. His achievement is
    not so much to refute common sense, but rather to expose the immense logical complexity
    underlying it. Cf. ¶69.

III. Force and Understanding: Appearance and Supersensible World
¶132. 1. Consciousness has reduced the unity of a thing and the diversity of its properties to
    two thoughts, respectively Being-for itself, or singularity, and Being for an other, or
    universality. If Being-for–itself were taken as the essence of the thing and contrasted
    with its inessential Being for an other, then Being-for-itself would be conditioned by Being
    for   an   other    and,    therefore,    itself   inessential.    But    consciousness       combines       the    two
    thoughts, as each involving the other, so that together they constitute a self-contained,
    unconditioned universal, a universal that does not depend for its nature on anything else.
    This universal is in itself the mirror-image of consciousness itself, for consciousness has
    undergone the same conceptual process as its object and has in fact produced the object by
    its own movement. But consciousness has not yet become a logician and does not see that
    the unconditioned universal is its own Self: cf. ¶165. It still regards the object as                       its object,
    distinct from itself.
¶133. 1. In sensory certainty and perception, consciousness itself intervened in the develop-
    ment of its object. It did so, in part because it recognized its own structural affinity to the
    object. To the understanding, by contrast, its object seems quite different from itself, since it
    fails to recognize its conceptual nature. Hence it leaves the object to its own devices. It does
    not develop the ‘concept’ it inherits from perception. Hegel has to do this himself, and when
    he presents the result to consciousness it will become a                      ‘comprehending’         or conceptual
    consciousness, rather than merely one with understanding: cf. ¶165.
¶134. 1. We are tempted to suppose that the unconditioned universal, the unity of Being-for-
    itself and Being for another, is only a form, and that some content needs to be added to them
    in order to fully portray the current state of affairs; that we need to specify e.g. whether the
---
      

    form applies to salt or to, say, chocolate. But this is not so. The form itself generates its own
    content. Whether something is salt or chocolate is determined by its formal relations to
    surrounding entities. Such specific content, therefore, does not concern us here.
¶135. 1. Nevertheless, a sort of form–content distinction emerges. The form is Being for
    another in unity with Being-for-itself, while the content is the universal medium and the
    One, to which they respectively correspond. But it is clear that the latter two moments will
    be integrated into each other, as are the formal moments that constitute their essence.
¶136. 1. Understanding conceives the object as a simple unitary force, which, however,
    manifests or expresses itself as a diversity of properties. A force of the type with which
    Hegel was familiar, does not account for an object as a whole but only for certain features of
    its behaviour. A magnet, e.g., has a magnetic force, which expresses itself in the attraction of
    iron  filings; but the magnetic force requires a bar of metal if it is to exist, and it does not
    account for the existence of this bar of metal. Hegel assumes, for the sake of the argument,
    that a whole bar of metal, with all its properties, is the expression of a single force. A force is
    sometimes latent or dormant, and sometimes expressed or manifest. The understanding,
    true to its partitive nature, separates these aspects, but they are equally essential to force.
    Hegel links the movement of force with the movement of perceiving, in which the perceiver
    and the perceived each has the structure of a force, a simple unity that burgeons into a
    diverse sensory array. Beneath this               ‘objective’, i.e. observable, array the unconditioned
    universal is the unobservable            ‘interior’. Two opposing forces are like the extremes of a
    syllogism. A balloon, e.g., is the middle term. It retains its size and shape owing to the
    interplay between the air pressure within the balloon (which tends to expand the balloon so
    as to become equal to the pressure of the air outside) and the elasticity of the material from
    which the balloon is made (which tends to contract the balloon).
¶137. 1. In treating the force as the               ‘interior’, we neglected the expression of force. The
    diverse properties of a thing are equally a part of force itself. To explain why the force
    expresses itself we postulate something external to it that                     ‘solicits’  or stimulates it to do
    so. Similarly, when the force withdraws into latency something external is needed to
    explain why it does so. However, since a force necessarily                     expresses itself, and necessarily
    withdraws into latency, this second force is really only an essential aspect of force
    itself. Hence the external stimulant is itself a force. (It is unclear why a force must express
    itself, rather than simply be such that it            would express itself, if certain circumstances were
    to obtain.)
¶138. 1. The force thus splits up into two forces, one solicited and the other soliciting. The
    forces look independent of each other (or, at least the second looks independent of the first).
    But soliciting cuts both ways. The second force needs to be solicited to expression and to
    withdrawal as much as the first. So the forces reciprocally ‘exchange determinacies’: when
    one is latent, the other is manifest, and vice versa. (A latent force can only be solicited to
    express itself by a manifest force; it is less clear why both could not be manifest.)
¶139. 1. Force A is manifest (a universal medium) and solicits force B, which is latent (repressed).
    But A is manifest only because B is latent. Hence it is B that solicits A and makes A manifest. A is
    manifest only through B and solicits B only because B solicits A to solicit B. A immediately
    ceases to be manifest and B becomes manifest instead, but only because A solicits B to become
    so. So A posits the soliciting force B because A is essentially a universal medium. B’s manifest-
    ation is really A’s alter ego. The play of forces is a play within a single force.
¶140. 1. The forces have two distinguishing features: in content, one is a universal medium, the
    other latent; in form, one is actively soliciting, the other passively solicited. The difference
    of content is     our  way of distinguishing the two forces, while by the difference of form the
    two forces differentiate themselves. Consciousness itself sees that the features differentiating
    the forces are ‘vanishing’, in that the forces keep switching sides. We phenomenological
---
                                                                                                              

    observers see even more: each force, whatever its content, can be seen as soliciting, and
    being solicited by, the other at the very same time.
¶141. 1. We tend to think of the two forces as existing independently of each other and of their
    expression—like two boxers who have a life outside the boxing ring and may, or may not,
    choose to enter it. But this is not so. Neither force can exist without the other and without
    expressing itself—since even its latency is a mode of its expression. Because of this, nothing
    remains of force apart from the ‘thought’ of force. In the case of a substance, such as an oak-
    tree, we can distinguish between its concept, embedded in the seed, and its realization. But
    there is no concept of a force, apart from its realization.
¶142. 1. There are two ways of looking at force, in both of which it is universal. It is regarded,
    first, as a concrete entity playing an active causal role in things and, secondly, as an abstract
    or conceptual entity, accounting for, but not physically causing, the structure and behaviour
    of things. Both of these views play a part in ¶143, the first as the ‘intermediary play of forces’
    and the second as the         ‘interior’ beneath it.
¶143. 1. Hegel is here playing with the similarity of the words Schein (‘semblance, etc.’) and
    Sein   (‘Being’), as well as the difference between the cognate words Schein                        and Erscheinung
    (‘appearance’).
        2. The two extremes, understanding and the ‘interior’, are linked by a middle term,
    which is the ‘play of forces’          (cf. first view of force in ¶142) now reduced to a superficial
    status, in comparison with the interior (cf. the second view of force in ¶142). The play of
    forces is ‘semblance’, but when taken as a whole,                    ‘appearance’: see also       Enc. I, ¶131. The
    permutations of appearance on the sensory level are underpinned by, and provide a view of,
    the corresponding permutations on the interior, conceptual level. The concepts and their
    permutations are, in reality, the very same as those that constitute the innermost core of
    consciousness. Consciousness does not, however, recognize them as such, but regards them
    as an object distinct from itself.
¶144. 1. The universal is ‘absolute’ because it is self-contained, depending on no contrast with
    a singularity outside it. For all its imperfection, this Beyond opens up the space or element in
    which the truth may be located.
¶145. 1. A syllogism is an argument consisting of three propositions, a major premise, a minor
    premise and a conclusion: e.g. ‘All men are mortal, All Greeks are men, Therefore all Greeks
    are mortal’. It also contains three terms, e.g.             ‘men’, ‘Greeks’, and ‘mortal’. Of these ‘men’ is
    the middle term, since it appears in both premises, but not in the conclusion, and serves to
    link up the other two terms. With some help from the word Schluss, his word for ‘syllogism’,
    but literally    ‘closure, closing’, Hegel regards a syllogism as consisting not of propositions,
    but of terms. The middle term, here appearance, links up the two extremes, understanding
    and interior. See also Enc. I, ¶¶181ff.
¶146. 1. Hegel may be thinking of Kant’s unknowable thing-in-itself. But elsewhere (e.g. Enc. I,
    ¶140), when he discusses the interior, he quotes a poem (The Human Virtues) by a scientist
    and poet, Albrecht von Haller:            ‘Into the inwardness of nature/No created spirit penetrates,/
    Most fortunate, if it knows but the outer shell.’                  Goethe replied to this in another poem:
    ‘Nature has no core nor crust,/Here everything comes all at once.’ Goethe’s response is close to
    Hegel’s own view.
¶147. 1.     ‘X is the truth of Y’ means          ‘X is the fulfilment of Y, X is what Y really amounts to’.
    Hence the truth of the sensory is appearance, and the truth of appearance is the super-
    sensible. Hence the supersensible is             ‘appearance as appearance’, i.e. appearance as it is in
    truth. So the supersensible is not vacuous. Its content is a transformed version of
    appearance.
¶148. 1. The differences initially postulated between the two forces have collapsed. Each force
    is both soliciting and solicited. As for the difference between a universal medium and a
---
      

   unity, the forces keep switching sides. Even the difference between these relationships,
   soliciting/solicited and universal medium/unity, has collapsed. All that remains is the
   swirling activity of undifferentiated force. There is still difference in general, however.
   Force is still in play, and the understanding needs to give an account of this. It does so by
   resorting to the simple law of force.
¶149. 1. Appearance changes, but the law, though it is present in appearance, does not change.
   Since the law results from the universal difference in the play of force, the law too must
   involve difference and ‘exchange’ in order to account for this, but without itself succumbing
   to change or exchange.
¶150. 1. A law does not fully account for appearance, but only for what happens given certain
   initial conditions: Galileo’s law of free fall says that if a body falls to the earth, it does so with
   such and such an acceleration, but does not tell us why there is a body at all, why it is above
   the earth or why it falls. Again, there are many different laws. This makes it hard to account
   for a given phenomenon. If two or more laws bear on the same phenomenon, how are we to
   know what their relative contributions are and what the                     final outcome will be? At a deeper
   level we now face the problem of the relationship between different laws, of what makes one
   law different from another. Newton tried to unify the law of falling bodies and Kepler’s laws
   of planetary motion in a single theory. But the result of this is not a determinate law, but
   simply the      concept of a law, a declaration that the movement of bodies is law-governed,
   giving no precise information as to what the law is. (Hegel’s hostility to Newton is one of
   those embarrassing facts about him that we just have to accept: cf. Enc. II ¶¶269f.)
¶151. 1. Since universal attraction (gravity) is just the concept of law, the determinacy of law is
   relegated to appearance or the sensory. But universal attraction also subverts law itself. It
   concentrates the difference that law is supposed to contain into a simple universal and
   leaves the different moments dangling as mutually indifferent and merely implicit. Hence
   the differences return into the interior as a unity. Hegel’s general problem is that underlying
   the differences in a law there is a single universal force. He is obscure here, because he is
   trying to make a transition to electricity in ¶152. His conception of the difference or
   distinction within a law undergoes a transformation. As it was introduced in ¶149, it
   seemed to be simply the difference between the phenomena related by the law, between
   X and Y in ‘Whenever X happens, Y happens’. The force underlying such a law need not be
   a polar force, such as electricity, but may be a non-polar force, such as gravity. But now
   Hegel is moving towards the idea that the force underlying a reputable law must be polar,
   such that the difference is a difference within the force.
¶152. 1. Underlying a law is a single force, such as gravity or electricity. But a law involves
   difference. The laws of motion involve a distinction between space and time, between the
   distance covered and the time taken. Electricity involves a distinction between positive and
   negative electricity. Now the problem is: why does a single force bifurcate into two distinct
   things, into space and time or into positive and negative? Hegel is more or less aware that,
   while electricity is a polar force, gravity is not. Bodies with the same electrical charge repel
   each other, while bodies with opposite charges attract each other. But gravity only attracts, it
   does not repel; space and time are not two different manifestations of gravity, but simply
   presupposed by the operations of gravity. That still leaves the question: why does electricity
   take two forms, which we, for convenience, label positive and negative? Hegel does not
   know the answer, but he wisely resists the temptation to make the polarity of electricity an
   analytic truth.
¶153. 1. Motion necessarily involves space and time: a body moves through a certain distance
   during a certain time and with a certain velocity. Conversely, however, space and time do
   not necessarily coalesce to give rise to motion. There could, on Newton’s view, be space
   without time, or time without space, and distance without velocity. There is no essential
   connection between space and time. So there is really nothing necessary about motion, as
---
                                                                                                       

    thus conceived: it is just the contingent convergence of two quite distinct things, space and
    time. Hegel’s own implied view is that motion is not only analysable into space and time, but
    is presupposed by space and time:             ‘It is in motion that space and time first acquire actuality’
    (Enc. II, ¶261 Addition).
¶154. 1. There is no intrinsic differentiation within the force or the law. There is no necessity
    for the force, e.g. electricity, to bifurcate into positive and negative, and no necessity for the
    parts of the law, e.g. space and time, to coalesce in the law. Because of this, the understand-
    ing regards the differentiations as something it postulates, but which do not inhere in the
    Thing (Sache) itself. A single lightning flash is taken as an instance of a universal law, to the
    effect that whenever a cloud is in a certain observable condition, a lighting flash occurs. We
    attribute this to a build-up of opposite electrical charges in different parts of the cloud,
    which then discharge themselves. We assign to the force exactly the properties required to
    fulfil the law. But this is only how we need to view the matter, not how it really is. Such
    ‘explanation’ is tautological: it redescribes phenomena without properly explaining them.
    Cf. Molière: ‘Why opium produces sleep . . . Because there is in it dormitive power.’ How-
    ever, such tautological explanation later plays a positive role in ¶163, where Hegel argues
    that the interior is in fact the mirror-image of the understanding’s own movement.
¶155. 1. Understanding regards its object as static, and locates the movement of differenti-
    ation in the understanding itself. The movement is one whereby a difference is established,
    then sublated again. It was intended to apply to such differences as that between positive
    and negative electricity. But it also applies to the distinction between the understanding and
    the interior. That is yet another distinction in need of sublation. The understanding, or
    consciousness, cannot restrict the movement to understanding alone and keep it out of the
    interior.
¶156. 1. Hegel has in mind magnetism, where like, or ‘like-named’, poles repel each other, and
    unlike poles attract each other. Moreover, the distinction between a north and a south pole
    is a distinction without a difference. There is no discernible difference between them; they
    are differentiated only by their behaviour. If all north poles were to become south poles, and
    all south poles north poles, there would be no discernible difference, as long as they
    continued to attract and repel each other in the same way. Hegel implies, somewhat
    fancifully, that when a north pole repels another north pole, it repels itself and therefore
    becomes     a south pole, just as it does when it attracts a south pole. The self-repelling
    behaviour of magnets is again applied to the relationship between the understanding and
    the Thing or interior.
¶157. 1. Magnetism supplies a law that accords better with appearance than its static inverse
    did. The difference involved in the second law is now essential to the law itself: there cannot
    be a north pole without a south pole, or a south pole without a north pole. Change is
    intrinsic to the law itself: poles essentially attract and repel each other.
¶158. 1. The pole of a magnet that is attracted to the north pole of the earth is regarded as the
    north pole of the magnet. But since it is unlike poles that attract each other, the ‘north pole’
    of the earth must have the opposite polarity, i.e. it must really be the south pole.
        2. The inversion is now extended beyond magnetism to the idea of a world that is the
    inverse of our world in every respect, not only in its sensory qualities, but in its evaluations.
    Unlike a north–south switch, such a global inversion would be detectable: we would notice if
    white things became black and black things white. The evaluative inversions echo the
    Sermon on the Mount. But the account of crime and punishment expressed in ¶159
    represents Hegel’s own view of punishment as it is in this world rather than in heaven.
    See also PR ¶¶99–103 on punishment and PS ¶¶667ff. on pardon. (Hegel anticipates
    Nietzsche’s conception of the transvaluation of values.)
¶159. 1. This world and its inversion are not two distinct worlds. There is only one world
    constituted by the dynamic interplay between various pairs of opposites. Within this world
---
      

   inversion already occurs, not always in the sense that opposites turn into each other, but in
   the sense that opposites require each other. If a magnet is cut in half, the result is two
   magnets each with two opposite poles: a south pole essentially requires a north pole; so the
   essence of a south pole is a north pole; so the in-itself or intrinsic nature of a south pole is its
   opposite, a north pole. Not all opposites are like this: e.g. something may be entirely black
   with no white in it. So the inversion of opposites takes different forms. But Hegel views the
   world as constituted by a system of mutually dependent opposites, each pair of which
   involves some sort of inversion.
¶160. 1. This is infinity in the sense of what Hegel calls ‘good’ or ‘true’ infinity. It does not, like
   ‘bad’ infinity, go on forever, but is self-enclosed or what we might call ‘finite but unbounded’.
¶161. 1. The first, static laws are reinterpreted on the model of magnetism. We begin with (a) a
   unitary phenomenon or force, such as motion, gravity, or electricity. This is not cobbled
   together from disparate phenomena, but divides up, by a process of self-repulsion, into (b)
   such pairs of phenomena as space and time, positive and negative electricity, etc., the
   members of which are seemingly unconnected both with each other and with the unitary
   phenomenon from which they emerged. But (c) in reality the members of these pairs are
   related by a sort of magnetic polarity, such that each is essentially connected with the other
   and with their unitary source. See also ¶153 on motion, space, and time.
¶162. 1. Hegel’s problem is to explain how a simple, self-contained unity that is not merely a
   composite of other entities (as e.g. motion is commonly supposed to be) can engender
   ‘difference or otherness’. His answer is illuminated by considering magnetism, which he
   clearly has in mind. A magnet involves differences which are not really differences, both
   because there is no discernible            intrinsic difference between its two poles and because each
   pole essentially requires the other: each is intrinsically related to the other as its opposite,
   and generates a replica of it if the magnet is sawn in half. (Hegel assumes that the non-
   existence of a       monopolar       magnet requires no explanation.) A magnet is therefore                      both
   uniformly ‘like itself ’ and divided. The magnet-model also applies to electricity, whose close
   relation to magnetism became known in the 1820s. Whether it applies equally well to
   motion, space, and time is another question.
¶163. 1. It becomes increasingly clear, as we survey this summary of understanding’s attempts
   to  fill out the interior underlying appearance, that the interior is really the mirror-image of
   the understanding’s own movement. This was intimated, albeit inadequately, by the scien-
   tific anti-realism of       ‘explanation’: cf. ¶154. Understanding’s consciousness of the interior,
   therefore, is in fact consciousness of itself, self-consciousness, even if the understanding is
   not yet aware of this.
¶164. 1. On infinity, see e.g.           Enc. I, ¶94:     ‘But this infinite progression is not the genuine
   Infinite, which consists rather in remaining at home with itself in its other, or (when it is
   expressed as a process) in coming to itself in its other.’                     This concept of infinity readily
   applies to minimal self-consciousness, the I that is aware of the I, the two I’s being, like
   magnetic poles, both different and the same. But why does it follow that when consciousness
   is conscious of the interior, it is really conscious only of itself? It is because the self-inverting
   infinity that the understanding has located in the interior applies not only to items within
   the interior, but also to the relation between the understanding and the interior. They too
   are analogous to self-repelling, other-attracting, undifferentiated, but self-differentiating
   magnetic poles. That consciousness of an object is necessarily self-consciousness does not
   mean that whenever one is conscious of an object, that object is oneself, but only that if one
   is conscious of an object, then one is conscious of oneself as well. It is only the interior of
   objects that is oneself in this strong sense. Earlier shapes of consciousness did refer to the
   I or subject, but the subject was only a correlate of the specific object to which it was
   harnessed: cf. ¶91. Now the Self emerges as a player in its own right.

¶165. 1. This view of the world is more or less Hegel’s own view. He does not sublate it as he
    did the earlier shapes of consciousness. It may be his response to Schelling’s problem: how
    can a simple neutral absolute differentiate itself into a diverse world, in particular into the
    realms of nature and mind? The problem arises out of Kant’s doctrine that the world of
    appearances emerges from interaction between the I, or Self, and things-in-themselves. The
    I is not just an appearance. It is what appearances appear to, what, in collaboration with
    other things-in-themselves, produces appearances. So the I is a thing-in-itself, existing prior
    to its interaction with other things in themselves. Things-in-themselves divide into two
    realms: the I, or mind, and the non-I, the natural objects it produces in interaction with
    other things-in-themselves. Unlike Kant, his successors tried to explain this division.
    Hegel’s preliminary answer is that the absolute, things-in-themselves, is like a magnet and
    inevitably generates two opposites, mind and nature. The upshot is that the I or Self is no
    longer an inessential observer of the world. It is an essential part of the cosmic setup. It is
    one pole of the magnet, whose other pole is the inner nature of things, and between them
    they generate the world of appearance.

B. Self-Consciousness
IV. The Truth of Certainty of Oneself
¶166. 1. The object of consciousness is distinct from consciousness and from the conscious
    subject. So there may be a discrepancy between the object as it really is and the object as it is
    for me. The object as it really is is the object            ‘in itself ’, while the object as it seems to me is
    the concept of the object or the object as it is for another. However, no such discrepancy can
    arise in self-consciousness, where certainty is its own object, or consciousness is the ‘true’ to
    itself. As in ¶84, Hegel does not mind which side we call the ‘concept’ and which the ‘object’.
    If knowing is the concept and the I the object, the I ‘corresponds to’ the knowing, the object
    to the concept. If, conversely, the I as object in itself is the concept, while the object as
    known by another is the object, then equally there can be no discrepancy. That ‘concept’ can
    play these two contrasting roles, depends partly on a distinction between a thin conception
    of the object and a thick conception of it, partly on a distinction between                        my conception of
    an object and the         concept of an object, in the sense of its inner nature which needs to
    manifest itself. This minimal self-consciousness is Cartesian. Descartes cannot be mistaken
    when he thinks ‘I think, I am’—but only because his self-knowledge is vanishingly thin: his
    claims about his identity, capacities, motives, and behaviour, are open to error. Descartes’s
    and Hegel’s use of ‘I’ might seem illicit, since it lacks its usual contrasts with ‘you’, ‘he’, ‘she’,
    and ‘it’. Moreover, in ¶¶101f., Hegel said that since the word ‘I’ is self-applicable, it cannot
    individuate anyone in particular. (Descartes does not know who he is.) In the remainder of
    this chapter, Hegel confronts these difficulties.
¶167. 1. The problem here is the continued persistence of sensory objects alongside self-
    consciousness. In the first three shapes of consciousness the object of one shape is ‘sublated’
    and its remnants are incorporated into the object of its successor. To an extent, the objects
    of consciousness are absorbed into self-consciousness, but only in the form of abstract
    categories underlying them: Being, singularity, universality, and ‘empty interior’. But, in
    addition, sensory and perceptible objects persist in their unredeemed form alongside self-
    consciousness. Self-consciousness cannot live without them. Its very emergence depends on
    its differentiation from them. If it simply kicks them away and breaks free of them, it lapses
    into a    ‘motionless tautology: I am I’. It would be like a political party that completely
    demolishes all its opponents. It would lose its determinate character as a party, since this
    depended on its contrast with its opponents. Political parties manage to live with their
---
      

    opponents. They want to win elections, but not so overwhelmingly that they eliminate the
    opposition and thereby their own distinctive character. But self-consciousness cannot
    accept a similar peaceful coexistence with the perceptible world, because it wants to be
    the master, the essence. This may owe something to the colloquial meaning of Selbstbewusst
    (sein) as ‘self-confident, self-confidence, self-assertive(ness)’. But to allow this to control his
    train of thought would be as arbitrary of Hegel, as if we were to allow our thought about self-
    consciousness to be guided by the colloquial meaning of its English counterpart. One
    problem may be that the sensory world has not acquired independence or objectivity,
    such that it is    the world, and not simply           my world. In the absence of other Selves, even of
    the concept of other Selves, who view the world from different angles, the world can hardly
    be regarded as objective and placed at a safe distance from myself. It is like a persistent
    illusion that follows me wherever I go and competes with me for mastery of myself. I am a
    divided Self, not fully in control. There is some evidence Hegel has this problem in mind: the
    claim that the sensory world lacks Being, that it is ‘appearance’, etc. Self-consciousness’s first
    attempt to solve its problem is to try to eliminate the sensory world altogether. It is desire—
    the desire to establish itself as the essence, the dominant limb of the opposition. (Self-)
    consciousness now has two objects, the sensory object marked as negative, and itself. Self-
    consciousness itself is the essence, but initially it occurs only in opposition to the sensory
    object. What it desires is to sublate this opposition and establish its own self-equality.
    However, in ¶182, desire is explicitly restricted to self-consciousness’s stance towards
    objects that are not themselves self-conscious.
¶168. 1. On the distinction between what is ‘for us’                     (viz. Hegel and/or his audience) or ‘in
    itself ’ and what is for the shape of consciousness under consideration, see ¶¶25, 82f., 111,
    etc.: in considering some lower form of consciousness, e.g. a child or a dog, we must
    distinguish between what we know and what is available to the form of consciousness
    under consideration. Hegel introduces life, if only                 ‘for us’, for several reasons. Humans are
    themselves alive and they desire to eat living things, not minerals. Life did not feature in
    chapters I–III, but III laid the conceptual foundations for it. Like self-consciousness, life
    involves a self-contained ‘infinity’, and withdrawal, or ‘reflection’, into itself. Somewhat like
    a magnet, the concept, or            ‘the universal result with which we enter this sphere’ (¶169),
    divides into two poles, self-consciousness and life. These are not, however, as undifferen-
    tiated as the poles of a magnet: self-consciousness is aware of itself, of life, and of the
    conflictual ‘infinite’ unity between them, while life is simply the unity and therefore in itself, not
    for itself. Life enters in two ways. Hegel points in two directions at once, to self-consciousness’s
    own life and the life outside it. His talk of unity suggests the life of self-consciousness, since this
    is most obviously unified with self-consciousness: self-consciousness is one pole of the magnet
    and   its life is the other pole. But the life that is the object of self-consciousness’s desire, and
    displays its independence must be external life. Probably life is initially undifferentiated. It
    begins as the opposite pole to self-consciousness, intimately associated with it, but then
    becomes independent. Life is not initially individuated into living creatures. The living creature
    (Lebendiges) does not emerge until ¶171. As yet life is something like a vital force. It is hard
    however to resist thinking of         ‘shapes’   and ‘members’        except as organs or organisms.
¶169. 1.    ‘Infinity’, as in ¶168, is       ‘self-containment’, or what Hegel later calls                ‘good’   or ‘true’
    infinity, not endless succession (‘bad infinity’). Hegel’s image of good infinity is a circle, in
    contrast to the straight line of bad infinity. It is unclear whether he is thinking here of a
    single living organism or of the whole system of living organisms. His account might fit
    either or both, since each organ of an organism is related to every other organ in something
    like the way in which different organisms are related to each other, relations of dependency
    and relative independency. Both an organism and a system of organisms have a circular
    structure. The brain makes the heart beat, and in return the heart supplies blood to the
---
                                                                                                             

    brain. Plants provide food for animals, which in turn distribute seeds that enable plants to
    propagate. The ‘differences’ are, respectively, the different organs of an organism and the
    different plant and animal species. Infinity is both in repose and restless, characterized, that
    is, both by the maintenance of the organism or the ecological system and by the continual
    change within them. Within such a system ‘time’, or the temporal sequence, is repetitive and
    circular, and follows a circular course through the organs, or organisms, arrayed in space.
¶170. 1.    ‘For themselves’       ( für sich) here means ‘by themselves’, much the same as ‘independ-
    ent’ (selbständigen, lit. ‘self-standing’). The ‘shapes’ are the ‘members’, independent parts of
    an organic unity. A pebble is a unity, but a homogeneous unity, since it is not a negative
    unity, repelling itself into different organs, nor             ‘infinite’, forming a self-enclosed, interlock-
    ing system. A heart and a brain are independent, but cannot survive outside the organism.
    Their independence is not intrinsic to them, like the independence of a pebble, but
    determined by ‘an other’, the system to which it belongs and the other members of that
    system. (What is said about organs of a single creature might also be said of animal or plant
    species.) This other also sublates the division, bringing each organ back into the organic
    system. This sublation is equally the work of the organ itself. The organ is not recaptured
    like a truant schoolboy, who could very well survive on his own; it cannot survive or
    function outside the organism. Life is a dynamic system, as if each organ is repelled by the
    organism and itself strives to escape, but is then brought back, attracted by its familiar
    abode. Cf. Schelling II.540:            ‘As walking is a constantly prevented falling, so life is a
    constantly prevented extinction of the vital process.’
¶171. 1.    ‘Inorganic nature’ is not used in the strict sense, but refers to the life outside the
    organism, the fluid medium that has not congealed into separate organisms. It is the life
    outside, the ‘fluid medium’, that began as the essence, but now the tables are turned; there is
    an inversion, whereby an individual shape asserts its independence and becomes the
    essence, treating the fluid medium as the               ‘other’. Presumably Hegel has in mind the three
    aspects of life which he derived from Albrecht von Haller (1707–1777): sensibility, irrit-
    ability and reproduction. He discusses them in PS ¶¶ 265–89, Enc. I, ¶¶218–20 and Enc. II,
    ¶¶355f. Von Haller gave priority to irritability, the tendency to contract when touched, since
    it is a feature of all living tissue, whereas sensibility belongs only to tissue with nerves. But
    Hegel gives priority to sensibility, because it occurs within the organism, regardless of what
    is happening outside. Reproduction refers both to the constant regeneration that an
    organism undergoes in its struggle to remain alive and to the procreation of new organisms
    of the same kind or genus to replace the original organism after it loses its battle against the
    elements encroaching on it.
¶172. 1. The ‘immediate unity’ is the initial organism, while the ‘reflected unity’ is the new
    organism generated by it, an organism of the same kind or                       ‘genus’ (Gattung). (A kind is a
    species rather than a genus, but Hegel uses the word Gattung, because of its association with
    procreation. The usual word for a ‘species’, Art, has no special connection with procreation.
    However, he draws the Gattung-Art distinction in PS ¶¶254, 295.) Enc. I, ¶220 mentions
    also sexual reproduction, involving an affinity between organisms of the same kind.
    Presumably this lurked somewhere beneath the abstract vocabulary of PS ¶171. Hegel
    makes a suspect transition from the genus to consciousness, parallel to the similarly suspect
    transition to      ‘cognition’    in   Enc. I, ¶223. Generic life is            ‘for’  consciousness, but so is
    everything else. A genus or species does not require consciousness for its demarcation.
    But Hegel points to an affinity between the biological genus and the generic I.
¶173. 1. Self-consciousness is also life, i.e. embedded in a living creature, and also involving a
    difference that is no difference, similar to those in external life. It is                ‘genus for its own Self ’
    not because human beings are one animal genus (or species) among others, but because the
    I itself is purely generic, too thin to be the I of anyone in particular: cf. ¶102. Self-consciousness
---
      

   is, and perhaps sees itself, mirrored in generic life and undergoes a similar ‘unfolding’ and
   enrichment. The poverty of the generic I is one problem that self-consciousness needs
   to resolve.
¶174. 1. The ‘shaped independent moments’                    are the living creatures that have emerged from
   the   fluid medium. The        ‘differences’ that are for the I ‘no differences’            may be the differences
   within life or the differences within the I itself. The plural suggests the former. But then why
   does the I’s awareness of this depend on its being the                         ‘negative essence’       of the living
   creatures? Perhaps Hegel means that if the living creatures retain their independence,
   then the differences are real differences and so, that the I has to eliminate them in order
   to maintain its view of the unreality of the differences. But why must it do that? Perhaps to
   secure the affinity of life to itself, since the I does involve such a non-difference. This implies
   that what self-consciousness wants is not to sublate life as such, but (as Hegel says)
   independent life, the stubborn little pockets that are independent not only of self-
   consciousness but of the          fluid medium of life itself. As ‘certainty’            was introduced in ¶166,
   it seemed to be a cognitive or theoretical concept: to be certain of an object was, roughly, to
   have convictions about it, albeit convictions that are undermined as their implications are
   worked out. But it cannot have only this meaning in the case of ‘self-certainty’ or ‘certain of
   itself ’. How could one’s sheer self-awareness depend on                          ‘sublating’    things other than
   oneself? It must have the flavour of             ‘self-assurance’, perhaps even of ‘self-centredness’.
¶175. 1. The natural object resists self-consciousness’s assault for two reasons. First, self-
   consciousness derives its self-certainty from the act of sublating the object. If the object
   were the only one available and self-consciousness succeeded in sublating it, so that it had
   no other opponent to sublate, then its success would amount to failure. It would find itself in
   the hapless position of an overwhelmingly successful political party: cf. ¶167. Secondly,
   however, the object sublated is not the only object available. Self-consciousness ‘generates it
   again’. What Hegel has in mind is simply another natural object, which self-consciousness
   in turn sublates, i.e. devours—as the word ‘desire’ (Begierde) suggests. Self-consciousness
   might then embark on a ‘bad infinite’ progression and proceed indefinitely, consuming one
   thing after another. But this will not give it the satisfaction it requires. The object cannot be
   sublated or negated by self-consciousness, so it must be something that sublates itself. At
   first sight, it is not clear why this would solve the original problem(s). If it is the act of
   sublating that self-consciousness requires, an act of self-sublating would defeat its purpose
   as much as an act of sublating conducted by itself. Analogously, if a party’s political
   opponents were to dissolve their party voluntarily, this would deprive the remaining
   party of the opposition it requires as much as would its overwhelming victory. Again,
   why should a self-sublating object get self-consciousness off the treadmill of endless
   sublation? There might be an endless series of self-sublating objects just as much as an
   endless series of other-sublated objects. But it is the fact that the self-sublating object is a
   self-consciousness that terminates the infinite progression. The conclusion that it is a self-
   consciousness is reached by two steps. First, a self-negating, yet independent object, must be
   a consciousness. Secondly, the negation involved can only be life’s                            ‘inorganic universal
   nature’, and this is the genus as such, and therefore self-consciousness. It is clear that Hegel
   believes there to be a rational route from life to self-consciousness, and equally clear that,
   however plausible the transition may be as a narrative, he has not found such a route.
¶176. 1. There are three stages or aspects to self-consciousness. The first is the I’s awareness of
   itself, without any apparent intermediary. Secondly, however, this involves desire, a desire to
   sublate an independent object. The satisfaction of this desire makes self-consciousness
   rebound back into itself, fulfilling its aim of certainty of itself and consolidating the                            first
   stage. (In ¶175 this second stage seemed to be a complete failure, but now it is seen as a
   partial success.) But thirdly, there is a second rebound, not only into the original self-
---
                                                                                                              

    consciousness but into a duplicate of it. Self-consciousness’s object now nullifies its other-
    ness or difference, while remaining independent; that is, it becomes a self-consciousness
    itself and therefore not other than or different from the                      first self-consciousness, yet still
    independent of it. The ‘merely living shape’ is said ‘also’ to sublate its independence—as if
    this were a point of similarity with the second self-consciousness. Perhaps Hegel’s train of
    thought is this: in a way the second self-consciousness sublates its own independence in
    nullifying its otherness or difference, but in reality this secures its independence. The shape
    too sublates its independence, and thereby its difference, but in doing so it ceases to exist.
¶177. 1. Often, when Hegel says something of the form ‘X is for Y’, he means roughly                                   ‘Y is
    aware of X’. Thus here he means that a self-consciousness is aware of a self-consciousness,
    and that only in this way does self-consciousness become aware of the unity of itself in its
    otherness. As in ¶176, it is unclear what its otherness is. There are at least four ways in which
    self-consciousness is ‘other’: (1) It is quasi-divided into the I that is (self-)conscious and the
    I of which it is conscious. (2) It is both conscious of sensory things and self-conscious. (3) It
    is both a unitary I and a differentiated living creature. (4) It is other than the second self-
    consciousness. Otherness (1) does not seem to be affected by the presence of another self-
    consciousness. It has been aware of this bifurcation all along. Otherness (4) makes it aware
    of its being one among several self-consciousnesses. But this is just what is required to
    resolve some other otherness. We are left then with the related othernesses (2) and (3). Self-
    consciousness is both a living creature, conscious of and desiring other living creatures
    surrounding it, and a unitary self-conscious ego. In its solitude it could not see how to fit
    these two aspects together, but now it has a visible example of a creature similar to itself that
    seems to have performed this task. Now it has an ‘object’ (Gegenstand) appropriate to itself.
    Its own I is not a proper object. It does not stand over against ( gegen) it as independent. The
    object of desire, life, is independent but not an I. Another self-consciousness fulfils both
    requirements. The memorable phrase ‘I that is We, and We that is I’ refers not to the present
    stage of self-consciousness, but to spirit proper, where individual I’s share a form of life and
    recognize each other mutually. At the present stage self-consciousness is egocentric or
    selfish, somewhat like an infant, or for that matter an adolescent, who wants to be
    recognized by others but not to recognize them in turn. Self-consciousness at the present
    stage is merely the ‘concept’ of spirit, that is, the initial stage of it which will, in virtue of its
    inner dynamic, eventually become fully fledged spirit.

A .  INDEPENDENCE AND DEPENDENCE OF SELF - CONSCIOUSNESS : LORDSHIP
AND BONDAGE

¶178. 1. The verb anerkennen might sometimes be translated as ‘acknowledge’, whose mean-
    ing overlaps that of ‘recognize’, but does not coincide with it, since acknowledgement is
    invariably overt, whereas recognition need not be: one can recognize a person or one’s
    mistake without acknowledging him or it. That self-consciousness is in and for itself, with
    the implication of independence, only if it is recognized by others and is to that extent
    dependent on them, is itself an instance of the ambiguity and opposition that Hegel goes on
    to summarize. On ‘infinity’ as self-containment, see ¶¶168f. What is infinite here is the unity
    constituted by the interplay between a self-consciousness and its doppelganger.
¶179. 1. This is an instance of ambiguity. One might compare the case of two lovers: X sees
    Y as the ‘essence’       (‘You are everything to me!’), but in doing so claims Y as his own and
    thereby sees himself in Y—a relatively benign way of                     ‘sublating’    the other. In at least one
    sense of ‘recognition’, self-consciousness X already recognizes self-consciousness Y in virtue
    of seeing, or recognizing Y as another self-consciousness, rather than just another edible
    animal. Insofar as X goes on to treat Y as a self-consciousness, X also recognizes Y in the
---
     

   sense of     ‘acknowledging’. However, both X and Y require more than such minimal
   recognition or acknowledgement from each other.
¶180. 1. The first double sense occurred in ¶179. Compare lover X who abandons Y in order
   to regain his independence and self-sufficiency, but then finds that he has lost what gave
   meaning and substance to his life. X’s ‘sublation’ of Y is here a near reversal of his sublation
   of Y in ¶179. In what follows, X (and Y) attempts to find a solution to this dilemma, that
   whether X loves Y or leaves Y, in either case he sublates both Y and himself.
¶181. 1. X’s sublation of Y and of itself in ¶180 also amounts to a liberation of each of them. In
   sublating its     ‘otherness’, i.e. abandoning Y, it becomes independent and self-sufficient
   (‘equal to itself ’), and it equally makes Y independent and self-sufficient.
¶182. 1. The other, Y, is in exactly the same position as X. Everything said so far about
   X applies equally to Y. The claim that whatever X does is ‘both its own doing and the doing
   of the other’     might mean:
   (1)   For any action-token that X performs, Y performs an action-token distinct from X’s, but
         of the same type as X’s. E.g. if X sublates Y or shakes his                 fist at Y, then Y sublates X or
         shakes his fist at X. X and Y are mirror-images of each other.
   (2)   For any action-token that X performs, Y collaborates with X in the performance of that
         very same action-token. If, e.g., X sublates Y or shakes his fist at Y, then this sublating or
         fist-shaking is Y’s doing as well as X’s. X’s sublating or fist-shaking cannot have its effect
         unless Y plays his part in the performance.
   The ambiguity arises because in some cases the actions that Y performs in collaboration
   with X are also actions of the same type as X’s. When e.g. X sublates Y simply by viewing
   him as another self-consciousness (¶179), this only works if Y also views X as another self-
   consciousness. Unless Y shows signs of viewing X as another self-consciousness, X has
   little reason to regard X as a self-consciousness like himself, rather than simply one more
   edible animal. But this is not true of every action that X might perform. If X shakes his fist
   at Y, Y need not shake his fist at X in return. Y may cringe or run away instead. But if the
   fist-shaking is to have its effect, Y must do something to show that he recognizes it as a
   threatening       gesture.    Y   collaborates      in   X’s   action    without      reproducing       it.  Probably
   Hegel has both of these meanings in mind without clearly distinguishing them. Desire
   does not pervade self-consciousness’s relations to its self-conscious other. ‘Desire’ is here
   restricted to self-consciousness’s stance toward living objects that are not self-conscious: cf.
   ¶169.
¶183. 1. I do what I do both to the other and to myself. What I do is done                         both by myself and
   by the other. Thus in ¶187, I put the other and myself at risk of death, and I can only do this
   if the other does likewise, by engaging in combat.
¶184. 1. Like ‘play of forces’, the movement of self-consciousness is syllogistic: cf. ¶¶136, 141,
   and 146. Here the middle term is initially self-consciousness itself. Since neither X nor Y can
   be a proper self-consciousness without the other, their interplay results from a bifurcation of
   self-consciousness rather than from their coming together. As forces in ¶138 exchange their
   determinacies of        ‘soliciting’   and    ‘being solicited’, in ¶179 each self-consciousness both
   sublates the other and is sublated by it. Consciousness is of an object distinct from itself,
   in contrast to the simple self-aware I of minimal self-consciousness (¶167). Hence each self-
   consciousness comes outside itself (cf. ¶179), while nevertheless remaining aware of itself
   and of its being outside itself, and to that extent within itself. In this sense each is aware
   of both being and not being another consciousness, and equally aware that the other
   is independent (‘for itself ’) only by sublating its own independence and depending on the
   independence of the other. (The expression ‘for itself ’                  wavers between self-awareness and
   independence.) Thus, whereas initially the middle term between X and Y was the self-
---
                                                                                                        

    consciousness common to both, each is now the middle term to the other. Each joins
    together with itself, or fulfils itself, in virtue of its relationship with the other; each is, both in
    its own eyes and in those of the other, an immediate, self-aware and independent essence—
    ‘immediate’     in that the process of mediation has been left behind. It follows from this that
    X and Y recognize each other, and that each recognizes that the other recognizes it.
    However,     ‘recognize’ here does not entail acknowledgement: X recognizes Y and recognizes
    that Y recognizes X, but X may not signal this recognition to Y.
¶185. 1. It is unclear whether this ¶ and what follows describe a continuation of the process
    presented in ¶184 or is, alternatively, an account of how the reciprocal recognition with
    which ¶184 concludes is reached. From the point of view of either party, there is an
    ‘inequality’. But how is this to be analysed in terms of recognition? If we look at the
    situation from X’s point of view, is it the case that X recognizes Y, but is not recognized
    by Y? Or is it conversely the case that X is recognized by Y, but does not recognize Y? If
    either of these is the case, it must be the first. For if X does not recognize Y as a self-
    consciousness, then the dyadic situation, and therefore the inequality, cannot arise.
    Similarly, from Y’s point of view, Y recognizes X, but is not recognized by X. So from a
    neutral point of view, there is no inequality. Perhaps Hegel means that there is an
    inequality from the neutral viewpoint, but if so, there must be some difference between
    X and Y that he has not yet revealed. A clearer asymmetry, from the point of view of each
    party, emerges in ¶186: each is certain of itself, but not of the other. But what is the role of
    recognition in this?
¶186. 1. Hegel here replays the process whereby self-consciousness emerges from life. X is
    aware of itself as I, distinguishing itself from everything other than itself, and therefore an
    individual in the way that no other living thing is an individual. X encounters Y, another
    self-consciousness on a par with itself. But initially neither X nor Y sees the other as a self-
    consciousness even of this minimal sort. They view each other as consciousnesses, but as
    conscious in the way that animals are conscious, not yet having disentangled its pure I or
    ego from the motley paraphernalia of life. Each is ‘certain of itself ’                   but this has no  ‘truth’,
    unless its own ‘Being-for-itself ’ is presented as an ‘independent object’, i.e. unless the other
    is presented as certain of itself as well. This is only possible if each party, in collaboration
    with the other, reveals itself as performing the required ego-abstraction by the process
    described in ¶184.
       In the case of many properties that we might attribute to ourselves—being a professor, a
    genius, beautiful, etc.—one might be ‘certain’ of possessing that property, yet the attribution
    will lack   ‘truth’ unless it is recognized by others. The others need not themselves have the
    property in question. One need not be a professor, a genius, or beautiful, in order to
    recognize someone else as a professor, a genius, or beautiful. However, the others must
    have certain qualifications if they are to give me appropriate recognition. They must be self-
    conscious in Hegel’s sense: a dog or a cat cannot properly confirm my own self-image. They
    must have further qualifications: they must, for example, be sane and be competent judges
    of the properties in question. In addition, I must know or believe that they possess these
    qualifications, if I am to be assured of my self-image. But they need not have, and I need
    not believe them to have, the same properties as I ascribe to myself. The case of self-
    consciousness is different. If anything is to recognize and confirm my sheer self-certainty,
    then it must itself be self-certain and I must be aware that it is self-certain; my recognizer
    must have, and be recognized as having, exactly the same property as I have. They do not
    need any other special qualifications, except perhaps sanity. But why, it might be asked, does
    my self-certainty need confirmation by others? I might believe that I am a professor, a
    genius, a beauty, yet not be any of these in reality. But if I think I am self-certain, then surely
    I am self-certain. Others may believe that I am dead or a zombie, but despite that I can be
---
      

    sure that I am self-certain. However, Hegel’s point here is not that my self-certainty requires
    recognition by others in order to be confirmed, but that I need to be presented with an
    objective case of self-certainty, self-certainty as seen from a 2nd or 3 rd person viewpoint, not
    simply from the 1st person viewpoint that is all that is available to me at present. Recogni-
    tion is required for me to attain to this viewpoint and thereby upgrade my self-certainty to
    self-consciousness. But why do I need to ascend to this viewpoint and what good will it do
    me if I do? If I think I am a genius, it may be some use for me to encounter another genius to
    measure myself against—as long as he is a certified genius and we are not involved in a folie
    à deux. It will also show me what a genius looks like from the outside and enable me to
    locate myself on the map of human variability. Something similar comes from a self-certain
    ego’s encounter with another self-certain ego. It shows me that I belong to a class of entities,
    only one of which is accessible to me in the 1st person, the others in the 2 nd or 3 rd person. In
    doing so, it clips the wings of my egocentricity, revealing that the world I see around me is
    not  my   world, but a world, an objective             world, that is shared with others of my kind and
    accessible from different viewpoints. (Descartes, though bereft of human others, is released
    from his subjective world by invoking God.) This enables me to draw a boundary round
    myself and to see myself as one consciousness within the world, not the bearer of the world.
¶187. 1. One might show that one is not attached to one’s money either by giving it away or by
    staking it as a bet on some non-monetary prize. Similarly, one might show that one is not
    attached to one’s life either by committing suicide or by risking one’s life for a prize, in this
    case the death or defeat of another. See Inwood (1986) on Hegel’s ambivalence about
    suicide. Hegel endorses the Stoic doctrine that the possibility of it confers freedom on us,
    but in PR ¶70 Addition argues that one has no right to kill oneself, since ‘he does not stand
    over himself and he cannot pass judgement on himself ’. This argument, if is sound, might
    also tell against risking one’s life: if I am identical with my life and I have no right over
    myself, how can I have a right to risk my life? However, while the suicide passes, or attempts
    to pass judgement on himself (such as that his life is not worth living), the risk-taker need
    pass no such judgement, his primary purpose being not to end his life but to win the prize.
    Moreover, while in PR Hegel is tackling the question whether one is entitled to kill oneself,
    in PS he is not concerned with whether the combatants are entitled to risk their lives, but
    only with the significance of their actions if they do take the risk. Mortal combat is required
    if self-consciousness is to dissociate itself from its ‘Being-there’, i.e. the world surrounding
    self-consciousness (‘universal singularity’) and self-consciousness’s own biological life, in
    contrast to the ego itself. Sex will not do, since it does not detach one from Being-there, nor
    will solitary risk-taking, since it lacks the presence and recognition of another. Hegel shares
    Hobbes’s belief that natural men are combative—though he differs from Hobbes in believ-
    ing that the combat is motivated by a desire for recognition rather than by fear of others,
    and also in believing that modern men are quite different from natural men: see                                Enc. III,
    ¶432 Addition. The combat requires the collaboration of both parties: X aims at the death of
    Y, but X can only achieve this aim if Y risks his life by aiming at the death of X. It is unclear
    whether and why X aims at the death of Y. There are 3 possibilities: (1) X wants to display its
    detachment from Being-there by risking death and can only do this if it provokes Y by
    aiming at his death. Even if X kills Y, he will still display his detachment from life, even
    though Y will be unable to recognize this achievement except                        fleetingly. But surely X and
    Y could risk death without actually              aiming at each other’s deaths; they might engage in a
    combat that involves a risk          of death, without aiming to kill. In fact, X’s requirement would
    be met if Y wore protective clothing, minimizing his risk of death, while still threatening to
    kill X; the problem with that is that Y would then be deprived of the opportunity of
    displaying his      detachment from Being-there. (2) X wants Y’s recognition and the only
    way to get this is by fighting Y, if need be, to the death. X’s desire for Y’s recognition will be
---
                                                                                                               

    frustrated if he actually kills Y. So Y’s death, since it would deprive him of what he really
    wants, is not his primary aim. He is ready kill Y if Y refuses to recognize him, but his                              first
    preference is for Y to surrender and recognize him. (3) X aims at Y’s death, because he wants
    above all to eliminate Y. This is suggested by the final sentence of the paragraph. X wants to
    kill Y because he sees Y as an external mirror-image of his own inadequate Self, a
    ‘manifoldly entangled consciousness that simply is’, which it (X?) must come to see as
    ‘pure Being-for-itself ’. This takes up the earlier point that X wants to sublate Y. But
    sublation need not amount to killing. Killing Y is only one way in which X can sublate Y.
    He can also sublate Y by transforming him into                     ‘pure Being-for-itself ’      and he can do that
    not by killing him, but by threatening to kill him. If he really wants to kill Y, why does he
    refrain from doing so when Y surrenders? Perhaps Hegel’s idea is that X begins by simply
    wanting to kill Y, but as the fight proceeds and Y displays his mettle, it occurs to him that it
    would be better to get his recognition. In the combat Y, and also X, are transformed into
    someone whose recognition is worth obtaining and not simply eliminated. (If ‘as each stakes
    its life, so each must aim at the other’s death’              is intended as an inference, it is invalid. Each
    may risk death without either             aiming at the other’s death.)
       In PR, ‘person’ applies to someone who owns property recognized by others. There is no
    suggestion that such a person risks, or has risked, death. It is unclear whether Hegel is here
    using   ‘Person’    in this sense. He may just mean that someone can be recognized as a human
    being without his having risked death. This is not only a possibility. X must recognize Y as a
    person in a minimal sense if he is to regard him as a worthy combatant in the                                 first place
    rather than another edible creature.
¶188. 1. This is an elaborate way of saying that if one or both of the combatants actually dies,
    then the game is up. A dead person cannot be fully self-conscious (‘the truth’), nor even self-
    certain, nor give recognition. Death is            ‘abstract negation’, in contrast to the          ‘negation of con-
    sciousness’, where the genitive is subjective, that is, the negation is undertaken by consciousness,
    not undergone by it. Abstract negation sublates something in the sense of simply eliminating it,
    whereas the negation conducted by consciousness also preserves it, by e.g. reducing it to servitude.
¶189. 1. In the situation envisaged, at least one of the combatants remains alive, since
    otherwise there would be no self-consciousness for the essentiality of life to ‘dawn’ on.
    ‘Immediate self-consciousness’             is the   first stage mentioned in ¶176, with the               ‘pure undif-
    ferentiated I’ as its object. This is what the combatant invokes when he puts his life at risk.
    The trappings of life are not regarded as essential to the                     ‘simple I’.    ‘For us’    or  ‘in itself ’,
    though not yet for self-consciousness itself, this I is not simply                       ‘immediate’, but involves
    ‘absolute mediation’, that is, it is the sublation of objects other than itself in the form of
    desire. (This process has some affinity to the way in which Descartes arrives at the cogito by
    successively doubting the existence of all external objects: the immediacy of the ego is
    mediated by doubt, though not, of course, by consumption. See also ¶167.) It interacts with
    the world around it in a way that a pure I cannot. However, as a simple I it still retains a
    ‘subsistent independence’, it stands on its own two feet, even though in its interaction with
    objects around it, it still depends on these objects. This is the second stage of ¶176.The
    experience leading to it, the ‘first experience’, dissolves the simple unity of the I, and there
    are now two sides to self-consciousness: ‘pure self-consciousness’, the residue of the simple
    I—which still persists, because self-consciousness can, after all, risk its life—and ‘conscious-
    ness’, which involves the face that it turns towards the outside world and that makes it into a
    ‘thing’ accessible to others as well as itself. ‘Consciousness’ is essentially consciousness of an
    object distinct from oneself. Hence a conscious being is necessarily environed by other
    objects and, if it is to interact with them, must be a ‘thing’ in the way that they are, whatever
    other features it may have. These two aspects have not yet been unified; that doesn’t happen
    until the third stage of ¶176, and perhaps not even there. They are unalike, or ‘unequal’, and
---

    opposed to each other. They take the form, therefore, of two opposed shapes of conscious-
    ness: a consciousness that stands on its own two feet with Being-for-itself as the essence, i.e.
    the residue of pure self-consciousness (the lord), and a dependent consciousness with Being
    for another, or life, as the essence (the bondsman).
       This passage lends support to interpretations that locate the lord and the bondsman
    within a single (self-)consciousness. There is within each of us a lord-self and a bondsman-
    self. It is not implausible to view an individual human mind as hierarchical. We are not only
    conscious of, or represent, other things. We are also conscious of our own consciousnesses
    and represent our own representations, think about our own thoughts and perhaps intro-
    spectively perceive our own perceptions, are aware of, and sometimes desire or censure, our
    own desires. We are not only sentient or conscious of things, but also self-conscious, a Self
    and a meta-self. Animals lack such a capacity to step back from their perceptions and
    desires, and to monitor or supervise them, asking whether they are veridical or appropriate.
    So the bondsman within us can reasonably be associated with the life we share with lower
    animals. Hegel quite likely viewed the mind in this way. It does not follow, however, that he
    located the lord and bondsman only within the single mind. As seen in ¶184, he views the
    two self-consciousnesses not as a chance encounter between them, but as the bifurcation of
    a single self-consciousness, in something like the way in which a magnet bifurcates into two
    poles. Like more recent philosophers, such as Heidegger and Sartre, he believes that an
    individual human being has an inbuilt requirement for another human being, in order to
    complete itself. More specifically, when he introduces a concept, he attempts to motivate its
    introduction by showing how it develops intelligibly from the concepts he has deployed so
    far. Everything is, in Hegel’s view, rationally connected. There are no sudden leaps in
    thought or reality. Hence it is only natural that he should introduce the concepts of lord and
    bondsman in terms of the concepts that he has been applying to the individual mind.
    Moreover, the drama he describes cannot be only an external drama. Self-consciousness is
    not simply fighting, defeating, and bonding another self-consciousness. It is also undergoing
    an internal transformation, in which his bifurcated Self is integrated into a unity. This
    internal drama is described in terms of the external drama correlated with it. So each of the
    combatants has a lord and bondsman within itself. This does not entail that their applica-
    tion is restricted to the individual mind, that the lord and bondsman are only in the mind.
    The description of them as ‘two opposed shapes of consciousness’ prepares the way for their
    emergence outside the individual mind.
¶190. 1. The internal lord and bondsman are transformed into the external lord and bonds-
    man, located in different people. Hegel does not describe the combat or explain why one of
    the combatants submits to the other; he leaves that to our imagination. Initially the lord was
    only the    ‘concept’    of, only potentially, a consciousness for itself, but now it is actually such,
    since it is now mediated with itself by ‘another consciousness’, the bondsman conscious-
    ness. Is this other consciousness the bondsman within a single mind or is it another
    individual? It must be the latter. From at least the second stage of ¶176 the individual has
    had a bondsman consciousness within itself. Why only now does it fulfil its potentiality as a
    consciousness for itself? It can only be because it has a bondsman outside itself. There are
    two items besides the lord himself, a desired thing and the bondsman consciousness. It
    relates to each of these in two ways, immediately and mediately, (a) and (b). It is tempting to
    regard (a) not simply as self-consciousness’s immediate awareness of a thing and a person
    outside him, but as his relation to the bondsman within him and to the things that, as a
    bondsman, he desires. That is, the drama is played out in two theatres, one internal, the
    other external. That the lord is          ‘concept of self-consciousness, immediate relation of Being-
    for-Self’ seems a better reason for saying that it is immediately related to aspects of itself
    than for saying that it is so related to external things. By contrast, (b) describes the external

                                                                                             

   drama, as is indicated by ‘from now on’ (nunmehr). The other combatant has surrendered
   and thereby shown himself to be                   fitting material for bondage. The bondsman           is
   dependent on        ‘independent Being’, on life and the things that life involves. When it
   came to the crunch he could not bring himself to sacrifice his life. By contrast, the lord
   risked his life to the end, showing that he sets no store by the things of life and therefore
   has them in his power, using them to subject the bondsman to himself. This is a
   ‘syllogism’: the lord relates to the bondsman by way of things. See also ¶184. In another
   syllogism, the lord relates to things by way of the bondsman. He makes the bondsman
   work on things and then consumes them. The bondsman is not only a bondsman, but
   also a self-consciousness of sorts. So he is sufficiently negative towards things to work on
   them, though not to annihilate them. The lord, by contrast, goes the whole hog: he
   negates or sublates things entirely by consuming the bondsman’s finished product. In this
   way the lord apparently solves the problem faced by desire in ¶¶167 and 175. That
   problem, the object’s         ‘independence’, is transferred to the bondsman, while the lord
   enjoys its dependence. Hegel’s solution is as obscure as the original problem, but at
   least the solution is best supplied by a real, external bondsman than by an internal
   bondsman within the mind. It may be, however, that the process is mirrored in the
   internal drama too: the meta-self may be better off dealing with an object presented to it
   by the Self than dealing with it directly.
¶191. 1. The two moments should be the thing as object of desire and the bondsman, for
   whom ‘thinghood’ is essential—as in ¶190. They are now paraphrased as the bondsman’s
   ‘working on the thing’ and his ‘dependency on a determinate Being-there’, presumably his
   attachment to life and its goods. He cannot shed these encumbrances and reach ‘absolute
   negation’, the total independence of Being-for-itself (see also ¶¶175, 187). He regards
   himself as unessential in comparison with the thing and, presumably, with the lord. The
   bondsman therefore abases himself before the lord and recognizes him—in the specific
   sense of one-sided recognition. Since the lord treats him like dirt, the bondsman is doing to
   himself what the lord does to him already. In this respect the lord and bondsman act in
   parallel and are equal collaborators in the act of recognition. In another respect, however,
   the act of recognition is the lord’s doing, not the bondsman’s. The lord has the whip hand.
   Since their relationship is so unequal, the lord being the essence, etc. and the bondsman
   unessential, the bondsman is merely a puppet whose strings are pulled by the lord. If Y gives
   ‘proper’ recognition to X, then (1) what X does to Y, X also does to himself (X), and (2) what
   Y does to himself (Y), Y also does to X. These conditions are not fulfilled in this case.
   Therefore, this is not a case of proper recognition: it is one-sided and unequal.
      This conclusion raises three questions: (i) What are the two conditions of proper
   recognition? (ii) Why are they not fulfilled? (iii) What is wrong with this improper
   recognition? The answers are as follows: (i) It is unclear whether (1) and (2) are meant to
   be the same condition applied to each party or a different condition for each party. They
   seem to be different if we rewrite (1) as ‘If X does (act) A to Y, then X does A to X’ and (2) ‘If
   Y does A to Y, then Y does A to X’. But it is likely that Hegel didn’t notice this difference and
   meant the same condition to apply to each party, viz. that each of them should perform the
   very same acts (of the relevant type) both to the other and to himself. Thus, for example, if
   X despises Y, then X should despise himself, and if Y abases himself, he should also abase X.
   (ii) These conditions are not met, because neither X (the lord) nor Y (the bondsman) act in
   these reciprocal ways. (The fact that the bondsman, being a mere puppet, does not really
   act at all is not relevant. Y simply does not do anything.) (iii) The non-fulfilment of these
   conditions implies that if there is any recognition, then it is ‘one-sided and unequal’. But
   this alone does not mean that it is not ‘proper’ recognition. Recognition, in more than
   one sense, need not be reciprocal. I may recognize (identify) someone in a line-up or
---
      

    identification parade, when he does not recognize me. My creditor may recognize
    (acknowledge) me in passing, when I do not recognize him. A general may recognize
    someone as a hero by pinning a medal on him, while the hero does not similarly
    recognize him. However, Hegel probably has an additional point in mind. Being a
    mere puppet, the bondsman cannot really do anything, and therefore cannot properly
    recognize the lord. If he is so despised and abased by the lord, his recognition of the lord
    is a sham. It is as if the general who gives me a medal for my heroism is an impostor, a
    cowardly incompetent, or a puppet manipulated by myself. There is a near reversal of the
    roles of the lord and bondsman, reminiscent of the reversal of the poles of a magnet
    (cf. ¶168) and of the old joke: ‘Policeman:                “I’m the boss, and you’re nothing.” Suspect:
    “That’s a good job, boss over nothing!” ’
¶192. 1. Here the         ‘unessentiality’     of the bondsman comes into play. The claim that the
    bondsman constitutes the ‘truth’ of the lord’s self-certainty means something like: this is
    the upshot or fulfilment of his self-certainty, or what it amounts to. What the lord is, and
    what the bondsman should be—its                  ‘concept’—is an independent consciousness. But the
    bondsman is dependent. So the lord cannot get confirmation of his Being-for-himself from
    the bondsman. Hegel seems to make a move from: ‘The lord does not get confirmation of
    his Being-for-himself ’ to ‘The lord ceases to have Being-for-himself ’. If so, the move is
    illicit. The fact that the general is an impostor, does not imply that I am not a hero, only that
    my heroism is not duly recognized. As we see in following ¶¶, the bondsman’s elevation is
    more substantial than the lord’s demotion.
¶193. 1. This ¶ raises three questions: (i) What is it for the servile consciousness to appear
    ‘outside of itself ’? (ii) What is it to be ‘truth of self-consciousness’                     and how is its not
    appearing as this related to its being outside itself? (iii) Why do the claims in (i) and (ii)
    contrast (‘But’) with the inversion that the lord and bondsman both undergo? The answers
    are as follows: (i) Its appearing ‘outside of itself ’ is echoed by ‘in relationship to lordship’ in
    ¶194 and contrasts with ‘driven back into itself ’ below and also with ‘within itself ’ in ¶194.
    (ii) Servile consciousness is the truth of the independent consciousness but it does not
    appear as the truth of self-consciousness. This looks contradictory but really is not. It is the
    truth of independent consciousness in relation to the lord and, as such, it is unessential, not
    the truth of, viz. fully fledged, self-consciousness. The grammar of ‘truth of ’ is not the same
    in both phrases. The           ‘truth of self-consciousness’          might be paraphrased as             ‘true self-
    consciousness’       or the    ‘truth consisting in self-consciousness’, whereas the                  ‘truth of the
    independent consciousness’             might be paraphrased as the               ‘upshot of the independent
    consciousness’. (iii) Hence the contrast with the inversion is genuine: servile consciousness
    did not initially appear as the truth of self-consciousness, but it will be converted into ‘true
    independence’, i.e. approximately the ‘truth of self-consciousness’.
¶194. 1. Just as the truth of the independent consciousness is the servile consciousness, so the
    truth of the servile consciousness is the independent consciousness. However, the latter
    occurrence of ‘truth’ cannot be paraphrased as ‘upshot’, since servile consciousness is not
    yet aware (‘for it’) that it has this ‘truth of [i.e. consisting in] pure negativity, etc.’ within it.
    Two experiences bring this truth out: (1) A generalized ‘anxiety’, fear of death, fear of the
    lord. This thoroughly shakes it up and focuses its attention on its Self, in a similar way to
    that in which the risk of death in combat focused the attention of the victor. It is aware of
    (‘for it’) this Being-for-Self, because it has the model of the lord’s Being-for-Self before it as
    its ‘object’. (2) In its service to the lord, it actualizes its new-found Being-for-Self by working
    on natural things: it gets rid of them and its attachment to them.
¶195. 1. Factors (1) and (2), anxiety and release from natural things, do not complete the
    transformation of the bondsman. It is now aware of its Self, but not yet of its Being-for-Self.
    This emerges in factor (3). The bondsman’s work has not only the negative effect of
---
                                                                                                             

    relieving him of natural objects and his attachment to them. It also gives a ‘permanence’
    both to the object and to the bondsman himself. For the lord, his desires, the objects and his
    enjoyment of them are fleeting and evanescent. For the bondsman, by contrast, desire is
    ‘held in check’. This ‘cultivates’ the bondsman, giving him a self-discipline and a long-term
    perspective that the lord lacks. It also cultivates and forms the object, conferring on it a
    permanence and independence that it lacks when it enters the lord’s hands and gullet. It
    therefore provides the bondsman with a model of his own independent Self.
¶196. 1. In working on an object, the bondsman cultivates something that presents him with a
    model of his own Being-for-Self. This is the ‘positive meaning’ of his activity. But cultivating
    or forming an object not only imposes a new form, it also removes or ‘sublates’ its previous
    form, the form that is a sheer          ‘being’. (There are two forms in play, the natural form of the
    unworked object and the form with which the bondsman replaces it.) This is its ‘negative
    meaning’. It is this previous, unrefined form that gave rise to his fear, for it is the ‘chain’ that
    holds him in dependence on the lord. But now he destroys this form and comes to realize
    that he himself is a permanent Being-for-Self. This comes about in three steps. In the figure
    of the lord, he has an alien Being-for-Self before him. In fear he has the Being-for-Self inside
    him. Finally, in cultivating an object he becomes aware of his own Being-for-Self. The new,
    refined form he imposes on the object is located outside him, but it is his own handiwork
    and testifies that he has a mind of his own and is not just a puppet of the lord. All three
    factors are needed for this result. (1) Service and obedience ensure that the fear spreads over
    the  ‘conscious actuality of Being-there’ and is not simply free-floating. (2) Cultivation gives
    the fear an external expression in which he can discern himself. (3) Absolute fear, consum-
    ing his whole       ‘natural consciousness’, is needed to ensure that he retains no residue of
    attachment to      ‘determinate Being’, i.e. Being-there, that the form he imposes is not a vain
    whim, still enmeshed in servitude, but expresses the essence of himself, and that his forming
    is not simply an isolated skill, but displays his mastery over the ‘universal power’ (Being-
    there in general?) and whole             ‘objective essence’       (his own essence as seen in the newly
    formed object?).
B .  FREEDOM OF SELF - CONSCIOUSNESS : STOICISM , SCEPTICISM ,
AND THE UNHAPPY CONSCIOUSNESS

¶197. 1. The ‘independent consciousness’ is the lord. He suffers from an inability to become a
    differentiated, yet unitary and persistent ego. This refers back to ¶195, where his desires and
    satisfactions are said to be          fleeting and, presumably, unconnected with each other. The
    bondsman, by contrast, is ‘driven back’ into himself (cf. ¶193) and therefore does not suffer
    from the dispersion of the lord. However, he does have a defect that is surprising in view of
    ¶196. He has before him both the object he has formed (‘itself as independent object’) and
    Being-for-itself in the lord (‘this object as a consciousness’). He does not realize, as                        we do,
    that  in themselves this form and the Being-for-itself are the same. In cultivating or forming
    the object, the bondsman has cultivated                   himself    and thereby reached, unbeknown to
    himself, the level of Being-for-Self. A new form of self-consciousness develops out of this,
    primarily from the servile consciousness, though the lord also plays a part in it. Hegel
    notices an affinity between, on the one hand, the sameness of Being-for-Self and the formed
    object, and, on the other hand, the sameness of the I and the concepts about, or in terms of,
    which it thinks. The thinking consciousness is infinite, in the sense of ‘self-contained’ (cf.
    ¶¶168, 169): in thinking concepts, it does not go outside itself, but remains self-enclosed. It
    is also  ‘free’, because it is wholly self-determined and not dependent on anything external.
    A   ‘concept’    is distinct from a         ‘representation’      and a     ‘shape’, and similarly a content
    ‘conceptualized’      is distinct from something             ‘represented’     or  ‘shaped’. (Hegel introduces
    ‘shape’ here to retain a connection with the object that is shaped by the bondsman, though
---
      

    he may also have in mind a link with a ‘shape’ or form of consciousness.) A concept is more
    general and abstract than a representation.                  ‘Causality’    or   ‘life’, for example, qualify as
    concepts, whereas         ‘heating’    or  ‘elephant’    are merely representations. The meaning and
    application of representations depend on our sensory input, whereas that of concepts
    have a minimal dependence on it and, in Hegel’s view, none at all. Concepts are a priori,
    embedded in the core of the human mind. So a concept is ‘mine’ in a more intimate way
    than a representation is ‘mine’. Hence when I think in terms of concepts I am interacting
    only with myself. Hegel distinguishes between the intrinsic meaning or content of a
    representation and its application, but he is less forthcoming about the distinction between
    a concept and its application. A representation is ‘mine’ only with qualification, since it
    depends on sensory input; correspondingly, what is represented is characteristically distinct
    from myself, a ‘being’. (This would be true even of my aches and pains, etc., since they too
    depend on sensations and do not lie at the core of my mind.) A concept is intrinsically and
    entirely mine, but it is not clear that its application is similarly independent of sensory input
    or that an object to which the concept is applied is not distinct from myself: ‘Jumbo is alive’
    seems little different in this respect from            ‘Jumbo is an elephant’. Hence Hegel is somewhat
    hazy about whether           ‘thinking’ is    about    concepts or, alternatively,         in terms of concepts,
    applying them to things that are conceptualized, but not themselves concepts. Probably he
    has in mind thinking         about concepts, since in the          final sentence he says that this ‘element’
    (viz. the concepts) does not engage in the                 ‘development and movement of its manifold
    Being’. Hegel applies to consciousness the expression that in ¶¶156ff. he applied to the like
    poles of a magnet: sich gleichnamige, literally ‘like-named to itself ’ or ‘homonymous with
    itself ’. Consciousness repels itself, as two like poles repel each other, and thus bifurcates into
    the thinking I and the concepts it thinks.
¶198. 1. Stoicism is so-called from the Stoa poikilē, the ‘painted porch’, a colonnade in Athens,
    where Zeno of Citium opened his school c.399 . From Greece, it spread to Rome and
    became especially influential in the Roman Empire. Ethics was central for the Stoics, but
    they also underpinned it with theories of logic and natural science. For the Stoics, all reality
    is material, but there is also a more active principle, ‘logos’, conceived both as the divine
    reason and as a finer type of all-pervasive matter. The human soul is a manifestation of the
    logos, and we should live in accordance with nature or reason, in conformity, that is, with
    the divine order of the universe. Since all human beings are a manifestation of a single logos,
    the Stoics endorsed cosmopolitanism and the natural equality of all human beings, regard-
    less of wealth and status. This coheres with their belief that the good lies not in external
    things, but in the state of the soul itself. No evil can afflict one as long as one has the wisdom
    and restraint to extirpate unruly passions and desires.
¶199. 1. The ‘manifold expansion of life’ includes such matters as whether I am a lord or a
    bondsman. Normally, one would care about that. A lord would                          ‘have its truth in’, roughly
    derive his significance from, the bondsman, while the bondsman would derive his signifi-
    cance from the will and service of the lord. But if both of them are Stoics, neither of them
    cares whether they are on the throne (like the Stoic emperor, Marcus Aurelius) or in chains
    (like, for a time, the Stoic Epictetus). They escape from ‘self-will’, which is supposed to
    be freedom but is really a type of bondage, both for the lord and for the bondsman. The
    Stoic withdraws into his own thought, into                    ‘lifelessness’, inactivity, and freedom from
    suffering. The ‘time of universal fear and bondage’ in which Stoicism became a ‘universal
    form of the world-spirit’ is the Roman Empire, from 27  when Octavianus adopted the
    title ‘Augustus’ and became the first emperor, until the rise of Christianity, culminating
    in the conversion of the emperor Constantine in 312 . (On the empire and the relation of
    Stoicism to it see also ¶¶477–80.) Hegel wrongly implies that Stoics withdrew from ‘activity’.
    The Stoic Seneca (c.4 –65 ) became the tutor of Nero, who became emperor in 54 

                                                                                                      

    and whose       first  five years in office were marked by clemency and moderation, under
    Seneca’s guidance. Similarly the reign of Marcus Aurelius (121–80 ) was marked by
    clemency and charitable work for the poor as well as defensive wars to protect the empire.
    A Stoic did engage in activity, but did so in the spirit of an actor, distancing himself from his
    activity and, presumably, not too elated by the success of his enterprise nor troubled by its
    failure. Activity in this spirit is consistent with Stoic doctrines. Hegel might object, however,
    that there lurks an inconsistency between choosing to act in one way rather than another,
    while remaining totally indifferent to the outcome. Even an actor needs to care about the
    success of his performance.
¶200. 1. The ‘otherness’         in the I is that between the I itself and the concepts it thinks. On the
    ‘double reflection’, cf. ¶176, where it involves a duplication of self-consciousness. Here the
    duplication is between self-consciousness, which withdraws into itself, and ‘natural Being-
    there’, which goes free. In order to act and to make claims about the world beyond thought,
    the Stoic needs some criterion for deciding what is good and what is true. But the answer to
    this question must either remain within the realm of pure thought and therefore have no
    bearing on the world beyond, or be arbitrary and disconnected from thought and rationality.
    Stoicism fails to bridge the gulf between its pure thought (logic) and the needs of practical
    conduct and empirical knowledge. In fact, Stoics were not quite as helpless in the face of the
    world as Hegel implies. Despite their belief that worldly things are indifferent, they neverthe-
    less argued that some things and some courses of action are preferable to others.
¶201. 1. Because it has withdrawn into itself away from Being-there, Stoicism fails to negate
    Being-there completely. Hence the content of Being-there reappears within it as a deter-
    minate thought that is disconnected from its underlying logic.
¶202. 1. Some Greek sophists were sceptics, but as a formal school scepticism began with
    Pyrrho of Elis (c.360–c.272 ) who taught that we can never know the real nature of things,
    that the appropriate response to this is suspension of judgement, and this will lead
    to tranquillity. His follower, Timon of Phlius, claimed that equally good reasons can be
    given both for and against any philosophical claim. Scepticism realizes the Stoic project
    (‘concept’) in that whereas Stoicism withdrew from the external world and left it ‘outside the
    infinitude [viz. of thought]’, scepticism tackles it head on and doubts its reality. Following
    his tendency to see repeated patterns in different shapes of consciousness, Hegel finds an
    analogy between the relation of Stoicism to Scepticism, on the one hand, and, on the other,
    the relation of the ‘concept of independent consciousness’ in lordship and bondage, to the
    realization of this concept in desire and labour. Desire was destructive, while labour was
    formative, but both negated natural entities, as scepticism does. Before this, the combatants,
    or at least the victor, perform an inner withdrawal in their indifference to life and its
    external goods. But the sceptic’s negation of externality is more effective, because he is
    already a ‘free self-consciousness’ and armed with a battery of concepts. In ‘pure thinking of
    itself ’—presumably that of the Stoic, but possibly of                     ‘independent consciousness’—the
    differences between things could be considered only in an abstract way, but the sceptic
    can consider these differences in their concrete reality.
¶203. 1. Hegel acknowledges his debt to scepticism by attributing to it his dialectical unrav-
    elling of sensory certainty, perception, and understanding in chapters I–III, or, as he
    conceives it, revealing the dialectical movement of which they consist. Scepticism now
    turns its fire on the lord–bondsman relationship and on Stoicism, in particular their ethical
    prescriptions. ‘Abstract thinking’ refers to Stoicism; what it counts as determinate is clearly
    inadequate. The lord–bondsman relationship involves a genuine determinacy in its pres-
    entation of ethical laws as ‘commands of mastery’. The determinate concepts deployed by
    Stoicism, by contrast, are          ‘pure abstractions’       and applied unsystematically to the Being
    outside thought.

¶204. 1. The first sentence expresses Hegel’s own view of dialectic, that the collapse of a shape
   of consciousness is not knowingly brought about either by consciousness itself or by the
   observing philosopher. The scepticism that he goes on to describe is the ancient scepticism
   which, though it contains Hegelian ingredients, is not his own: e.g. the ‘true and the real [do
   not] vanish without [his] knowing how’. (‘Vanish’                    should mean ‘vanish for thinking’, but
   this qualification is often omitted. In fact, the ancient sceptic does not even make things
   vanish for thinking. He simply doubts their reality; he does not claim to know that they are
   not real, since he denies that he knows anything at all.) The interventionism of ancient
   scepticism is marked by the shift from ‘consciousness’ to the more active and aggressive
   ‘self-consciousness’. The third sentence raises problems. What does Hegel mean by saying
   that ‘self-consciousness causes to vanish not only the objective as such, but its own attitude
   to it, etc.’? He might simply mean that, as well as doubting the reality of something and thus,
   in a way, making it vanish, the sceptic also causes to vanish his own previous unsceptical
   belief in it, including the perception on which this belief was based. However, he is more
   likely to mean that the sceptic casts doubt on his own sceptical reasoning on which his
   doubt is based. After all, if one doubts everything, one should surely doubt not only the
   truth of a claim or the existence of something, but also one’s reasons for doubting and even
   the very fact of one’s doubting.             ‘Sophistry’ for Hegel a derogatory term (cf. PS ¶¶130f.,
   where perception engages in sophistry to defend its position), following the Platonic
   Socrates’s criticisms of the sophists. The final two sentences introduce a specifically Hegel-
   ian idea: that anything determinate, whether a thing or a concept, owes its determinacy to its
   difference from something else, as e.g. conservatism depends on a contrast with liberalism,
   socialism, etc. Hence it is not ‘self-contained’, but depends on something else. It is therefore
   vulnerable to encroachment by this other. By contrast (‘but’), thinking is implicitly
   exempted from this dependence on something different from itself; it is ‘simple’, the insight
   into the nature of difference, not itself entangled in the network of differences. This is not
   obviously true.       ‘Thinking’      contrasts with       ‘sleeping’,   ‘day-dreaming’, etc., and although
   Descartes did not doubt that he was thinking, an ancient sceptic perhaps ought to doubt
   that he is thinking: after all, one of his strategies is the method of ‘equipollence’ (cf. ¶¶76 and
   83), that if I say p and you say not-p, your word is as good as mine. Hegel might object,
   however,      first, that when we consider the range of differences to which the concept of
   thinking belongs, the thinking in which we consider this range transcends the range itself,
   and secondly that if I say I’m thinking, you cannot produce a good reason for denying it and
   that any reason you do produce must be thought by me if I am to be moved by it. On Hegel
   and scepticism, see also Forster (1989).
¶205. 1. Hegel now turns to criticism of ancient scepticism. Ataraxia is peace of mind, which
   the ancient sceptics claimed as their goal; Hegel paraphrases it as ‘certainty of itself ’, in view
   of his stress on the connection of scepticism with self-consciousness. However, this condi-
   tion is not produced once and for all, leaving its ‘coming-to-be’ behind. The sceptic has to
   strive continually for his ataraxia. He tries to maintain an equilibrium between his sensory
   representations and the representations in his thought, for example, by doubting the reality
   of whatever he perceives and doubting the truth of any proposition presented to him.
   Sometimes these representations coincide or are ‘equal’ to each other, but then this equality
   dissolves again—succumbing to the fact that equality contrasts with inequality and is thus
   vulnerable to its encroachment: cf. ¶204. The sceptic is aware of this and admits to it. He
   admits to being a singular, contingent consciousness, on whom the practicalities of everyday
   life take their intellectual toll. He stops at a cliff-edge, even though officially he doubts its
   reality, doubts whether he will fall if he walks over it and whether he will come to any harm
   if he does. He obeys a law whose existence he officially doubts, and writes a book whose
   merit and very existence he doubts. He is like an ‘animal life’: a dog stops at a cliff edge,
---
                                                                                                              

    though it could hardly be said to            know anything about it. This is the sceptic as a singular,
    contingent consciousness. On the other hand, he also is a universal consciousness, entirely
    at ease and in harmony with itself. He oscillates between these two conditions, his ordinary
    perceptual, active life and his elevated sceptical stance. The sceptic’s position is an inten-
    sified form of the Stoic’s. The Stoic performs tasks in society, but does not believe that they
    really matter. He is distanced from the roles he plays like an actor. The sceptic similarly
    performs tasks, but he does so like an animal. It is not obvious that either position involves a
    strict contradiction. On a smaller scale we all make decisions, such as which side of the road
    to walk on, where it does not matter which we opt for, as long as we opt for one or the other.
    In making such a decision, I might think of myself as an actor or, alternatively, as an animal.
    If this does not involve an intolerable contradiction, why should there be an intolerable
    contradiction in the generalization of this predicament?
¶206. 1. In ¶205 the contradiction was between the sceptical attitude of universal doubt and
    the practical attitude of acting on everyday beliefs and norms. The sceptic was not explicitly
    aware of the contradiction, but flitted from one limb to the other in order to evade criticism.
    But now he puts two and two together and becomes aware of the two contradictory
    thoughts. He morphs into a double consciousness of itself as                      ‘self-liberating, etc.’, and itself
    as  ‘self-confusing, etc.’. It is not clear whether these two consciousnesses correspond to the
    sceptical and the everyday attitude respectively, or, if so, how they do so. After all, the
    confusion and inversion do not stem from either the sceptical or the practical attitude alone,
    but from their coexistence. It looks as if what is needed is a third consciousness, or aspect of
    consciousness—an overseer consciousness that is aware of the tension between the first two
    and conducts the contradiction-evading oscillation. But it is the ‘self-confusing’                         conscious-
    ness, or ‘the changeable’, that has to deal with all the confusions, and the drama is presented
    from its point of view. So it tends be an overseer as well.
       Hegel gives no hint here that Stoicism too is also a divided consciousness; its self-
    consciousness is        ‘simple freedom’. Scepticism realizes this freedom by annihilating the
    ‘Being-there’      that threatens it, not simply retreating from it. It is this that leads to its
    duplication of self-consciousness. Duplication is a recurrent theme in PS: e.g. ¶486 on the
    duplication into the world of ‘actuality’ and the world of the ‘aether of pure consciousness’.
    Especially memorable is the description of ‘faith’ in ¶572: ‘The faithful consciousness weighs
    and measures by a twofold standard, it has two sorts of eyes, two sorts of ears, two sorts of
    tongue and language, etc.’. See also ¶¶468, 525, and 583, and, for references to unhappy
    consciousness, ¶¶483 and 528. However, what Hegel probably has in mind in the later
    paragraphs is that spirit involves an equal partnership of two or more self-consciousnesses,
    ‘I that is   We, and      We    that is I’,   as in ¶177, rather than the unsatisfactory duplications
    referred to in the earlier paragraphs.
¶207. 1. If the two consciousnesses were completely severed from each other, then ‘it’, the
    overseer consciousness, might settle down in one of them and find ‘repose’. But it cannot do
    that, because each of the consciousnesses contains the other, and so the contradiction
    between them drives it from one to the other. What would really satisfy it and bring
    about its self-reconciliation is fully           fledged spirit, an equal partnership of two or more
    self-consciousnesses,        ‘I that is We, and We that is            I’, as in ¶177. It already contains the
    germ of this, involving as it does one undivided, yet duplicated consciousness, where two self-
    consciousnesses gaze into each other. When it becomes the unity of both self-consciousnesses
    its problem will be solved. This is presumably why Hegel implies that this unhappy
    consciousness is closer to spirit than the lord and bondsman were.
¶208. 1. The overseer consciousness is the immediate unity of two different and opposed
    consciousnesses. They cannot be of the same status therefore: one of them must be regarded
    as peripheral and inessential. (They could be of equal status, Hegel implies, if there were a
---
      

    mediated      unity of them.) Hegel now says something about the status of the overseer
    consciousness, a problem that emerged in ¶206. Because it is aware of the contradiction
    between the two consciousnesses, and is therefore a contradictory or, at least, unstable
    consciousness itself, it associates itself with the changeable, but it has an ambivalent
    relationship with the unchangeable. It is also aware of unchangeableness, so it must free
    itself from the changeable, i.e. from itself. We are to think of a religious man attempting to
    free himself from his worldly encumbrances, to make himself fit for union with God: ascent
    to the unchangeable by an unredeemed changeable infects the unchangeable (see ¶209). For
    itself it is only the changeable, while the unchangeable is foreign to it. On the other hand, it is
    simple consciousness and to that extent unchangeable. It is aware of this unchangeable
    consciousness as its essence, though again it is not this essence. It cannot regard the
    changeable and unchangeable as living in a peaceful coexistence of mutual indifference.
    So, being changeable, it cannot be indifferent to the unchangeable. It is shuttled back and
    forth from the one to the other, driven by its own contradictions as well as theirs. This
    reminds us of Augustine, Pascal, and Kierkegaard.
¶209. 1. The enemy is the changeable. In attaining one of the opposites, the unchangeable, the
    overseer consciousness loses it in its opposite, the changeable. It is discontented with its
    worldly life, regarding itself as nothing in contrast with the essence. So it ascends to the
    unchangeable, focuses its consciousness on it. But the ascent is performed by itself as
    singularity, and this infects the unchangeable. Singularity cannot be eliminated from its
    consciousness of the unchangeable. Hence the victory is Pyrrhic. Why the switch from
    ‘changeable’ to ‘singularity’? Perhaps because it is more obvious that in its ascent it must
    remain singular than that it must remain changeable, but also to prepare the way for ¶210.
¶210. 1. The defeat of ¶209 turns into victory. Unhappy consciousness sees an affinity between
    its own singularity and the singularity that has emerged in the unchangeable. The trans-
    formation of defeat into victory has three stages: (1) it finds itself opposed to the unchange-
    able again. It regards its conception of, and approach to, the unchangeable as marred by its
    own singularity. The unchangeable is alien to it and condemns singularity. This is defeat. (2)
    It sees that the unchangeable itself contains singularity, like itself. So the ‘whole mode of
    existence’    passes across to the unchangeable. It is not, as in (1), only its conception of, and
    approach to, the unchangeable that involves singularity, but the unchangeable itself. (3) It
    realizes that this singular in the unchangeable is, or approximates to, itself. So consciousness
    becomes spirit. It is overjoyed to              find itself in the unchangeable, and its singularity
    reconciled with the universal.
       This threefold movement alludes to the Father–Son–Spirit triad. Stage (1) is the God of
    Abraham, unapproachable by unworthy man. (2) Introduces genuine individuality into
    God, the son. (3) Is spirit, the stage of joy (symbolized by tongues of fire in Acts 2) and
    reconciliation (symbolized by the dove in Mark 1:10).
¶211. 1. What was described in ¶210 is the experience of the divided self-consciousness. But
    since this self-consciousness is also the unchangeable consciousness, this is singular con-
    sciousness too and it plays a part in the movement. As far as consciousness’s experience
    goes, the unchangeable is first opposed to singularity altogether, then singular itself, though
    still opposed to the other, then finally united with it. But we need to distinguish between
    unchangeableness of consciousness, which is still laden with an opposite, and true
    unchangeableness, the unchangeable independently. We don’t know how this behaves,
    only how it appears to consciousness.
¶212. 1. This ¶ alludes to the incarnation. The ‘shaping’, i.e. appearance in human shape, of
    the unchangeable consciousness remains separated and aloof from the singular conscious-
    ness, because we do not know how the unchangeable will behave. Its assuming human shape
    is a sheer ‘happening’, not the doing of singular consciousness. Even when it ‘finds itself ’ in
---
                                                                                                              

    this unchangeable, this is in part the unchangeable’s doing and still involves opposition. The
    sensory presence of the unchangeable is itself a barrier to unification with it. Moreover, it
    inevitably lasts only for a time and is remote in space.
¶213. 1. The divided consciousness abandons its original project of sublating its singularity
    and becoming the unchangeable consciousness. Instead, it tries to sever its relationship to
    the unshaped unchangeable and to relate only to the shaped                       unchangeable. It now wants to
    unite with the unchangeable without losing its singularity. In this way it hopes to circumvent
    the insuperable absolute dividedness that stood in the way of its original project. However, it
    still has to overcome the alienness of the shaped unchangeable. In referring to the                          ‘shapeless
    abstract unchangeable’, both here and in the preceding ¶¶, Hegel uses the neuter gender (das),
    but the    ‘shaped unchangeable’ is masculine, both here and in ¶215 (den, der).
¶214. 1. The first of these relationships is dealt with in ¶¶215, 216, and 217, the second in
    ¶¶218ff., and the third in ¶¶223ff.
¶215. 1. The shaped unchangeable is again masculine, hence ‘he’, etc. Hegel refers back to
    ¶211, where he said that we do not know how the unchangeable in and for itself                                      ‘will
    behave’. It is not quite clear what            ‘pure consciousness’        is, nor whether it refers to Christ’s
    contemporary followers or to later attempts to make sense of him. Subsequent ¶¶ give some
    clues about this. Without the cooperation of the unchangeable himself, consciousness of
    him cannot be complete and free of intrusive opposition.
¶216. 1. The unhappy consciousness now engages in pure and abstract thinking. So Hegel
    now has in mind attempts to make sense of Christ after his death. Unlike Stoicism, it brings
    its pure thinking to bear on singularity. It does not, however, get as far as ‘reconciling’                           the
    singularity of consciousness with pure thinking. What it misses is that                          ‘the unchangeable’
    (Hegel here reverts to the neuter) which appears ‘in the shape of singularity, is consciousness
    itself ’. This seems to mean that the unchangeable is not a distinct entity from consciousness
    and that Christ is no more, but no less, than a human being. Unhappy consciousness does
    not realize this, however.
¶217. 1. Pure consciousness is ‘in itself pure thinking singularity’ and the unchangeable is pure
    thinking. But the relation between them is not pure thinking, since pure consciousness does
    not approach the unchangeable               ‘thinkingly’     (denkend). It goes       ‘towards thinking’        (an das
    Denken hin) and is thus             ‘devotion’     (Andacht, a close relative of            ‘denken’    with its past
    participle    ‘gedacht’). Its approach to the object is now feeling rather than proper thinking.
    The object is not         ‘conceptualized’ and therefore appears alien. In effect, therefore, con-
    sciousness has retreated into the narcissism of the pure                       ‘heart’, which feels itself, but as
    painfully divided. It is certain of its essence as this pure heart, thinking itself as singularity,
    and this certainty is recognized by the object, because the object thinks itself as singularity.
    But this essence (presumably the object rather than the pure heart) still eludes it. When it
    tries to reach itself in the essence, which, like itself, thinks itself as singularity, it only ever
    finds its inessential Self as opposed to the unchangeable. It cannot grasp the unchangeable
    as a singular, since it regards it not as a concept, but as a sensory object that has inevitably
    vanished. It therefore seeks it in its grave, but finds it empty. (This alludes to the crusaders:
    cf. PH, p.393:      ‘At this sepulchre the Christian world received a second time the response
    given to the disciples when they sought the body of the Lord there:                        “Why seek ye the living
    among the dead? He is not here, but is risen.”’). So consciousness abandons the quest for the
    unchangeable as actual and begins to find its way to singularity as universal, in thought.
¶218. 1. This is the second of the stages mentioned in ¶214: desire and work. PH, p.395, gives
    the general idea: ‘Spirit, disappointed with regard to its craving for the sensuous presence of
    Deity, fell back upon itself. . . . From this time forward we witness religious and intellectual
    movements in which Spirit—transcending the repulsive and irrational existence by which it
    is surrounded—either finds its sphere of exercise within itself, and draws upon its own
---
      

    resources for satisfaction, or throws its energies into an actual world of general and morally
    justified aims, . . . .’   As instances of this change, Hegel mentions the establishment of
    monastic and chivalric orders, and the flourishing of theology, philosophy, science, and
    even art. ‘Desire’ and ‘enjoyment’            hark back to the lord in ¶190, but may also allude to the
    Eucharist. In reality, or ‘for us’, this worldly success is man’s own doing, stemming from the
    ‘self-feeling’ he has now reached. But to the unhappy consciousness itself it seems like a
    mysterious gift from the unattainable essence, and it is therefore divided between this world
    and a world beyond.
¶219. 1. Owing to the incarnation, the singular objects of desire and work are, like unhappy
    consciousness itself, internally divided. On one side they are worthless, on the other they
    embody the unchangeable essence. Because the unchangeable is universal, it constitutes one
    side not only of each single entity, but of the world as a whole.
¶220. 1. Actuality is now a shape of God. So consciousness can no longer regard it as
    intrinsically worthless, as it did in ¶174. It can only alter and enjoy actuality because God
    surrenders himself to it (especially in the Eucharist). Consciousness itself is correspondingly
    divided. On the surface, it is Being-for-itself, an independent agent. But in itself it owes all its
    power of activity to God.
¶221. 1. Active consciousness, and the passive actuality on which it operates, confront each
    other as two extremes. Underlying each extreme, however, is God himself. He freely
    supplies the power that enables consciousness to act and, at the other extreme, freely
    bends actuality to the will of consciousness. God thereby repels himself from himself in a
    way that recalls the behaviour of a magnet. So consciousness does not attribute its success to
    itself, but rather to the grace of God.
¶222. 1. The universal God renounces his shape and the singular consciousness renounces
    its independence by giving thanks. So it looks as if they have achieved unification. But this
    is illusory. Consciousness really did get satisfaction from its activity, despite its show of
    renouncing it. Its thanks-giving is its own action (seemingly exempt from the absolute
    power of God, so that God is not ventriloquistically thanking himself); it outweighs God’s
    renunciation of a mere surface of himself, since it renounces consciousness’s own action, its
    very essence. Singular consciousness has turned the tables on God. Not only has it gained
    satisfaction from what it renounces, but its renunciation has trumped God’s. By a ‘double
    reflection’ it re-emerges as an independent singularity in contrast to God.
¶223. 1. This is the third of the relationships heralded in ¶214, ‘consciousness of its Being-for-
    itself ’. The enemy that now lies in wait for it is sin.
¶225. 1. Because of its retreat into singularity, its activities lack universal content and signifi-
    cance. Consciousness therefore attempts to sublate this distressing singularity and accord-
    ingly focuses on the most conspicuously singular aspect of a human being, its animal,
    primarily sexual, functions. This is self-defeating, however, since if we pay excessive
    attention to our animal functions, especially if we try to suppress them, they come to
    seem far more important that they really are.
¶226. 1. Things are not as bad as they seem, however. Alongside unhappiness and impover-
    ishment, consciousness also has the thought of God, which is needed to mediate, or
    motivate, its assault on its singularity. In time this will make consciousness aware of its
    unity with God.
¶227. 1. Singularity therefore constitutes one extreme over against another, God. But owing to
    its sinfulness, consciousness can approach God only by way of a middle term, a priest or
    confessor. With the aid of the priest, consciousness continues its battle against singularity.
¶228. 1. All action involves guilt, Hegel believes, since in choosing one course of action one
    inevitably excludes other worthy alternatives: see e.g. ¶468. But consciousness can relieve
    itself of guilt by accepting the divinely inspired advice of the priest. It makes other sacrifices

                                                                                                             

    too: it speaks and listens to Latin, which it does not understand; it gives away its goods; and
    it fasts.
¶229. 1. The renunciation described in ¶222 was a deception. It left consciousness with the
    outer freedom to act and enjoy its property, and with the inner freedom to make its own
    decisions. By the renunciation described in ¶228 it gives up these remaining freedoms and
    turns itself into a thing rather than an I.
¶230. 1. Unhappy consciousness has shed everything it has, including its own singular will,
    and transferred it onto the universal essence or God. Even this transferral is not its own act,
    but imposed upon it by God via the mediating priest. All that remains is a universal,
    impersonal will and reason. Implicitly, the singular consciousness has become identical with
    this universal. From being nothing it has in effect become everything. Consciousness is not
    aware of all this and retains a remnant of unhappiness, but it has at least acquired the idea of
    impersonal reason. This reason is no longer the reason of Stoicism, detached from the
    singularity of the world. It embraces the singularity that consciousness transferred to it.
    ‘Reason’ in Hegel’s sense is different from ‘understanding’. Understanding is analytical and
    separates things and concepts, while reason brings them together. See e.g. Enc. I, ¶¶79–82.
    God has now come down to earth.

C. (AA.) Reason
V. Certainty and Truth of Reason
¶231. 1. For unhappy consciousness there were two extremes, the singular consciousness
    (Being-for-itself ) and God (Being-in-itself ), with no obvious link between them. But
    because singular consciousness has renounced itself and transferred itself to God, God is
    no longer exclusively universal, but incorporates worldly singularity. Consciousness has
    discarded its Being-for-itself and converted it into Being, the worldly Being that is now
    the other extreme to God. Consciousness is therefore no longer this other extreme, but
    the mediator between Being and the refurbished God, announcing to each their unity. The
    status of the mediating consciousness is unclear. Hyppolite, I, p.195, identifies it with the
    medieval Church, on the basis of ¶230. But it is more likely to be enlightenment reason, as
    yet undeveloped.
¶232. 1. So far consciousness has been hostile to the world and to its own position (‘actuality’)
    in it. Now it becomes reconciled to the world and adopts an idealist attitude towards it.
    Despite initial appearances,         ‘idealism’   here does not mean that it regards material things as
    constructions of the mind rather than existing independently, but that it discerns objective
    rationality in the world mirroring its own subjective rationality. The distinction between
    these two types of idealism corresponds to the distinction between two German words for
    ‘idea’: Vorstellung (‘representation’), a subjective idea in the mind, and                         Idee (‘Idea’), an
    objective idea or ideal in Plato’s and, especially, Aristotle’s sense. In PS, the word Idee occurs
    rarely outside the Preface, but see ¶¶269 and 276, and also Enc.I, ¶¶213–44 for Hegel’s later
    use of the word.
¶233. 1. The formula          ‘I am I’ suggests that Hegel has in mind the quasi-Kantian idealism of
    Fichte, who argued that the external world is a product of the I, which projects the external
    world as a non-I in opposition to itself. The formula ‘I am I’ might express simply ‘self-
    consciousness in general’ (cf. ¶167) or the              ‘free self-consciousness’ of Stoicism (¶197) and
    Scepticism (¶202). But in Fichte’s sense it expresses the simple self-equality of the I from
    which everything else can be derived. However, the point and motivation of this idealism is
    incomprehensible unless we take into account the preparatory stages presented in chapters
    I–IV of PS. Chapters I–III have, by their demolition of attempts to give coherent accounts of
    reality independently of consciousness, shown that self-consciousness is all reality ‘in itself ’,
---
     

   while IV has shown how it becomes aware of this. Chapter V will now cover this ground
   again from the point of view of reason. Section A., ‘Observing reason’ (¶¶240ff.) corres-
   ponds to chapters I–III; section B, ‘The actualization of rational self-consciousness through
   itself ’ (¶¶347ff.) corresponds to chapter IV; while section C, ‘Individuality which takes itself
   to be real in and for itself ’ (¶¶394ff.) expounds the single truth on which I–III (A) and IV (B)
   converge, viz. that whatever is (in itself) is for consciousness and whatever is for consciousness
   is in itself.
¶234. 1. Idealism faces the problem of equipollence, that a sheer assertion is no better than its
   contrary: cf. ¶76. Hegel’s primary response to this problem is to take on board both
   assertions, albeit in a modified form. This is how he treats seemingly competing philoso-
   phies: cf. ¶2. So when he says that reason sanctions the denial of idealism, he does not
   mean only that reason’s dogmatism entitles anti-idealists to be equally dogmatic, even
   though they are quite mistaken. He is implying that the claims of anti-idealism should be
   incorporated into a doctrine which, though it still remains an idealism, is quite different
   from the one-sided idealism of Fichte. Thus the ‘reflection from’                          the opposite certainty
   does not result in its sheer dismissal. The idea that the concept of something involves
   the process by which it came about echoes the dictum that                              ‘The true is the whole’:
   see ¶20. The       final sentence anticipates Nietzsche’s genealogy, especially his claim that
   ‘all concepts in which an entire process is semiotically concentrated elude definition; only
   that which has no history is definable’                (On the Genealogy of Morals, II.13). There is a
   parallelism between changing views of the I-object relation over history and the rational
   development of consciousness. In contrast to Nietzsche, Hegel regards both developments
   as progressive.
¶235. 1. In the Aristotelian tradition, categories are very general ways of classifying beings into
   substances, qualities, quantities, relations, etc. with no obvious connection to idealism. Kant
   transposed categories into an idealist mode. Categories are no longer ways of classifying
   objective beings, but very general concepts that we must apply to all beings in order to have
   knowledge of beings at all: substance, causality, etc. Our application of these categories
   makes reality known to us as a differentiated orderly system. The idea that the I is a single,
   simple category, converting reality into such a system coincident with our consciousness, is
   an innovation of Hegel’s, not found in Kant or Fichte. Kant’s was a ‘bad idealism’, leaving
   unknowable things-in-themselves beneath knowable reality; Hegel, in the spirit of Fichte,
   wants the whole of reality to be accessible to, even coincident with, consciousness. On
   Hegel’s own view, the negativity and difference that still remain between self-consciousness
   and reality (see ¶234) implies (somewhat mysteriously) that the single category must
   differentiate itself into a plurality of categories, as in Hegel’s Logic. Since Kant (and Fichte)
   overlooks this negativity, he can give no satisfactory account of the plurality of categories
   that it nevertheless imposes on him. He simply ‘finds’ them in the forms of judgement,
   which (on Hegel’s view) are not to be presupposed, but derived within the categorical
   system itself (Hegel’s Logic).
¶236. 1. There are four types of item in play: (1) The simple category—the I or consciousness;
   (2) the categories or species into which (1) diversifies; (3) the category of singularity
   (roughly ‘individuality’), which takes its place among (2); and (4) actual singular things,
   which are (or would be) the sheer ‘negative of consciousness’. The categories, (2), are not
   really ‘things’, i.e. (4), because (1) is their genus or essence. But (1) must overcome their,
   (2)’s, contradicting plurality by incorporating them in ‘negative unity’, a unity that takes
   account of their differences (like Hegel’s Logic). In doing this, (1) becomes not a singular
   entity (4), but the category of singularity (3). Singularity points towards an external
   reality, an other than itself. But this other turns out not to be real singulars (4), but simply
   other categories, so that consciousness remains enclosed within itself: each category refers
---
                                                                                                           

    only to other categories, not to anything beyond categories. The categories are involved in a
    merry-go-round of transition into each other. (Hegel will attempt to find an exit from this
    enclosure.)
¶237. 1. Consciousness oscillates between participating in the merry-go-round of the categor-
    ies and stepping back from them while surveying their movement from a distance.
¶238. 1.    ‘Mine’    translates Mein, the nominalized form of the                   first person possessive deter-
    miner, mein, ‘my, mine’. There is the same pun on                    ‘meaning’ (Meinen) as in ¶117.
        2. The I of Kantian idealism claims to be all reality. But it cannot fill out this proclam-
    ation, and the reality that it claims to be, from its own resources, since it is trapped within its
    categorical system. It therefore resorts to external sensations, in a thoroughly empiricist
    manner. Sensations are supposed to stem from an                   ‘impulse’ (Fichte) or from the unknowable
    ‘thing in itself ’   (Kant), alien imports designed only to do the work that the I cannot do for
    itself. These sensations run on in           ‘bad’, endless infinity. Idealism has ended up in the same
    position as ‘meaning’ (i.e. sensory certainty), perception, and understanding. It regards its
    knowledge, which is knowledge only of appearances, as untrue, since true knowledge is found
    only in the ‘unity of apperception’ (a Kantian expression meaning the coherent experience of
    a unitary Self, hence here the I itself), but counts it as knowledge nonetheless: cf. ¶75.
¶239. 1. Kantian–Fichtean idealism does not fulfil the promise implicit in its espousal of the
    abstract concept      of reason. This type of reason cannot handle the reality that confronts it.
    Actual reason, by contrast, begins with a more modest claim: that it is the certainty of being
    all reality, but not yet in truth, and therefore needs to fulfil its promise by providing a
    rational account of nature. On Kant, see also Enc. I, ¶¶40ff., esp. ¶60.
A .  OBSERVING REASON
¶240. 1. Hegel plays with the homonyms Sein, ‘Being’, the nominalized infinitive of sein, ‘to be’,
    and Seinen, the nominalized genitive of the third person possessive determiner, sein, ‘its, his’.
        2. Consciousness revisits the content of ‘meaning’                   (Meinen) and perceiving to reinter-
    pret it in terms of the unity of being and self-consciousness. It is now more active than
    previously: it approaches the world in order to find reason in things and its own (good)
    infinitude. Hegel has by now transformed the idealism of Kant and Fichte into an idealism
    closer to his own.
¶241. 1. The pure I, or abstract reason, can see itself in the world in general, but it requires the
    complexity and depth of developed reason to digest fully the complex differentiation of the
    world. The final sentence heralds the tripartite division of chapter V: in section A reason
    excavates the entrails of things, in B it completes itself within itself, and in C it experiences
    its own completion. Cf. ¶233.
¶242. 1. Reason forms, in Hegel’s view, the core of the human mind as well as the fundamental
    structure of the external world. In the mind reason has in a purer ‘shape’, while in the world
    it is entangled with sensory details. Thus Hegel’s developed system, to which PS is an
    intended introduction, begins with Logic, where concepts are considered in their own right.
    Only in the second part of the system are these concepts found embedded in natural
    phenomena and, in the third part, in the mind or spirit itself. Phenomenology, however,
    follows a different order. Reason begins not by considering itself, but by observing the
    natural world and attempting to find itself in it. It takes its unity with Being to be immediate,
    rather than mediated by a prior examination of itself in its pure form. Nevertheless, in
    cognizing things, it transforms them into concepts, and regards these as the essence of
    things. Consciousness sees what things are, but not yet that it is itself a system of concepts.
    Eventually it will come to know what we already know.
¶243. 1. Observing reason is tripartite, considering nature in ¶¶244–97, spirit (logical and
    psychological laws) in ¶¶298–308, and the relation between nature and spirit (physiognomy

   and phrenology) in ¶¶309–47). Reason is in search of itself, not just as an external observer,
   but as an actuality within the world, and hopes to                  find itself in ¶¶309ff.
a. Observation of nature
¶244. 1. Observation is not concerned only with sensations, nor even with the objects of
   perception that have been determined from sensations, but with objects regarded as
   instantiating a universal.
¶245. 1. The universals that reason                first considers are static. Entities are classified into
   universal types by the observer, not by the entities themselves. See, by contrast, the
   procedure recommended in ¶246, and also in                        Enc. I, ¶230 Addition:          ‘the principle of
   division must be taken from the very nature of the ob-ject that is to be subdivided, so
   that the division is made naturally and is not merely artificial, i.e. arbitrary. Hence, for
   example, the division of mammals in zoology is mainly based on the teeth and claws, and
   this makes sense, because the mammals distinguish themselves from one another through
   these parts of their bodies, and the universal type of the various classes can be traced back to
   them.’ In lieu of some such principle of classification (though preferably one that licenses
   the distinction between mammals and non-mammals as well) reason resorts to endless
   description, a movement of itself rather than of the objects themselves, with no way of
   distinguishing between what is essential and what is accidental.
¶246. 1. On the sexual differentiation of plants, noted especially by Linnaeus, see Enc. II, ¶348
   Addition.
       2. We can tell, e.g., that something is an acid when it is put into relation with litmus and
   turns it red, but that tells us little about its chemical composition when it is ‘at rest’.
       3. Here, and in ¶247, ‘stable’ translates               gleichbleibend(es), literally        ‘remaining-equal’.
   When an acid, e.g., is put into relation with its opposite, an alkali, it does not differentiate
   itself from the alkali, but turns into a neutral salt.
¶247. 1. Vagueness, borderline cases, and hybrids bedevil classificatory systems. A horse, e.g.,
   belongs to the genus equus, while its determinacy is                  caballus. A donkey also belongs to the
   horse family, but is by contrast              equus asinus. But how are we to classify the infertile
   offspring of a female horse and a male donkey, the mule? Here we are reduced to mere
   description to supplement our classificatory system.
¶248. 1. To handle the mutability and essential interrelatedness of differentiae or determin-
   acies, reason ascends from the domain of perception to that of the understanding, in search
   of the laws that govern their changes and relationships. It does so instinctively, driven by the
   exigencies of its subject-matter, not by a programme planned in advance. Such laws are not
   manifest in sensory reality, but must be extracted from it by experimentation, which
   detaches the law from specific sensory phenomena and renders it conceptual: cf. ¶251.
¶249. 1. A law must satisfy two requirements. First, it must be found in ‘experience’, which
   here has the flavour of ‘experiment’. Reason has no time for hypotheses that ought to be the
   case but are not confirmed in experience. (An implicit criticism of Fichte, but see also ¶337.)
   Secondly, it must have an intrinsic necessity and intelligibility, and not simply be a
   contingent succession or correlation. These two requirements are implied in the unusual
   word ‘self-essence’       (Selbstwesen), an essence that appears of its own accord.
¶250. 1. Reason regards its laws not as intrinsically rational, but as sheer alien facts. But if it
   really believed this, it would not accept such a generalization as                   ‘All stones fall when raised
   above the Earth and let go’ before testing it with every stone. In practice, it tests it with
   several stones and then claims to infer by ‘analogy’, or induction, that it applies to all stones:
   see Enc. I, ¶190. However, reasoning by analogy fails so often that it tells us not to trust
   reasoning by analogy. Moreover, it justifies only an assignment of probability, not of truth.
   In fact, reason accepts the unquestionable truth of this law; it speaks of probability only to
---
                                                                                                            

    indicate its lack of conceptual insight into the law. But it is also aware of the weight of the
    stone: the stone’s weight explains why it falls. Both factors are required for its acceptance of
    the law: experiential confirmation of the correlation and an explanation of it. (The intro-
    duction of weight would not withstand a scepticism as radical as Hume’s. How do we know
    that all stones are heavy, without lifting them all? How can we be sure that a stone that
    requires effort to lift will also fall when we let it go? Reason’s scepticism here is more easily
    satisfied than Hume’s.)
¶251. 1. Experiments extricate universals from the specific empirical material with which they
    are initially associated. This is especially the case with polar phenomena such as electricity,
    and acids and bases, which depend for their existence on their relationship to each other.
    The universal predicates are detached from the specific subjects in which they originally
    inhered. Because of this they tend to be regarded as distinct ‘matters’, though not exactly as
    ‘bodies’: cf. ¶115. The word           ‘synsomaties’      was coined by a Hungarian chemist, J.J. Winterl
    (1732–1802). He postulated two fundamental substances, which he named ‘Andronia’ and
    ‘Thelycke’     (from the Greek for          ‘male’   and ‘female’) that were the essences of acidity and
    alkalinity, or basicity, respectively and could inform any material substrate regardless of its
    other properties. In        Enc. II, ¶327, synsomaties are combinations of substances that do not
    interact chemically. The theory is obscure, but Hegel’s aim in PS ¶251 is to suggest that
    acidity and basicity are, like positive and negative electricity, essentially related to each other
    and indifferent to the material they inhabit.
¶252. 1. A matter, unlike a body, is not a thing, but a universal and therefore entirely
    appropriate for a law.
¶253. 1. Consciousness rises to the level of the law liberated from sensory material, then to the
    concept of law. But it sees this concept as a new type of object. The concept of law is the
    differentiated unity of determinacies, which keep passing into each other. The object that
    has this structure is the organic being.
¶254. 1. An organic thing is not dependent on and vulnerable to other things in the way that
    inorganic things are. It is a relatively closed system, with its parts unified and regulated by its
    concept. It maintains itself in the face of its surroundings.
¶255. 1. Organic entities are unified ‘individualities’, ‘reflected into themselves’, not simply ‘sin-
    gularities’, which inorganic things (apart from the planet in ¶245) tend to be. Inorganic things
    shed aspects of themselves onto organisms, while the latter remain relatively self-enclosed. So
    laws relating them concern the influence of the elements on organic entities rather than the other
    way round. These laws leave unexplained the wealth of organic life, and they are approximate
    rules, rather than exceptionless laws, especially since there is no conceptual relationship between
    organic entities and the elements as there is between positive and negative electricity or an
    acid and a base. In lieu of strict laws, reason resorts to teleological explanation, e.g. that a bear’s
    fur serves the purpose of protecting it from the cold. But this does not explain how this purpose
    gives rise to the fur. The thought floats freely above the organic and inorganic processes.
¶256. 1. On internal teleology, see ¶22. An organism maintains itself in the face of its
    environment. It integrates into a single system the relations of cause and effect, agent and
    patient, that are, in inorganic nature, separated from each other. Since its internal process is
    circular, e.g. the heart pumps blood to the brain, while the brain in turn keeps the heart
    working, no distinction can be drawn between what is                          first and what is the result. (The
    distinction between internal and external teleology is unclear, however. Hegel assumes that
    an organism’s environment is simply external to it. But if e.g. an animal lives off fruit and in
    its excrement distributes seeds that give rise to more fruit, the animal and the fruit seem to
    form a single symbiotic system rather than two systems external to each other. The
    distinction looks plausible because in ¶255 the causal traffic is one-way: the weather affects
    polar bears, but polar bears do not affect the weather.)

¶257. 1.    ‘End’ translates      ‘Ende’, which does not mean              ‘aim’  or  ‘purpose’     (Zweck), but only
    ‘finish, termination’. The purpose-concept is not simply the free-floating thought of ¶255,
    but is at work within the actual organism. An organism is related to and affected by its
    external environment. Suppose e.g. that its fur grows thicker in the winter. External
    teleology is content to say that the fur is explained by the purpose it serves, that what
    initiates its growth is the cold weather. But that does not explain why the weather has just
    this effect rather than its more natural effect of freezing the creature to death. What explains
    this is the underlying internal teleology of the organism’s self-maintenance. The survival
    of the organism is the end or result. But it is also what comes first: the cold would not have
    this effect if the animal had no tendency to maintain itself, by e.g. regulating its own tem-
    perature. In a sense, then, no change has taken place.
¶258. 1. Self-consciousness involves a (non-)distinction between I and myself, and accord-
    ingly it has found here a (non-)distinction between an animal and itself. The analogy
    between an animal’s consumption of food and reason’s approach to external reality is
    clear enough, but the analogue of the animal’s self-maintenance is obscure, because it
    is unclear what reason is in quest of. Is it simply trying to show that external reality is
    rationally intelligible, or to find a structural similarity (as here) between itself and external
    reality, or to locate rational humanity in the order of things? Presumably its quest would not
    be fulfilled even if it       were   to recognize this structural similarity between itself and the
    animal, since its account of reality would remain incomplete unless it could locate itself in
    reality as whole, which requires, among other things, explaining the difference between itself
    and an animal. However, while an animal finds repose in self-feeling after its meal, self-
    consciousness, since it is also consciousness, fails to recognize itself in the purpose as a
    thing, i.e. an animal. This is because it persists in taking the purpose to be an external
    purpose, external both to the animal and to consciousness itself, whose object it is. The
    purpose can only by located in ‘another understanding’, presumably God’s.
¶259. 1. Reason’s failure to recognize an organism’s inner purpose stems from the very fact
    that it is an inner purpose and so not manifest to observation. The organism presents its
    self-maintenance as if it were a contingent fact of its Being, not determined by its ‘purpose-
    concept’, i.e. the concept that constitutes its purpose. Hence reason locates that concept in
    ‘an understanding’, viz. God’s. Correspondingly, reason needs to view its                             own    concept
    outside itself, as a thing. Since it has no adequate conception of inner purposiveness, it
    cannot form an adequate conception of itself.
¶260. 1. On the view accepted by reason in ¶259, that the purpose-concept (i.e. the concept in
    which the organism’s purpose consists) is distinct from the organism’s self-maintenance,
    the organism’s activity is the middle term between the concept and the self-maintained
    organism. The activity is just individual bits of behaviour. (If the activity is taken as
    universal, then it belongs to the purpose-concept and not to the organism itself, since
    reason is unable to combine the universal with the changing individual.) In that case,
    however, the activity is entirely lawless. The concept requires only that the organism
    preserve itself; being external to the organism, it does not regulate the way in which it
    does so. For all we know, bears might light              fires or knit themselves sweaters to fend off the
    cold. If, by contrast, the concept is immanent in the organism, its activity is regulated
    lawfully.
¶261. 1. The unity of the universal purpose and the activity realizing it is an inner movement
    that can only be conceived conceptually, whereby moments continually pass into each
    other. But observation cannot conceive them in this way, but only as fixed and permanent.
    Hence it keeps universality and singularity apart from each other.

    the two sides is conveyed by the term              ‘expression’.
¶264. 1. Since the inner is an object of observation, it must have a character of its own and not
    simply be whatever is expressed by the outer. The inner must have an outer of its own, apart
    from the exterior of the organism.
¶265. 1.     ‘Soul’  is used in its Aristotelian sense of the animating principle of the body: see also
    Enc. III, ¶¶378 and 388ff. On the soul’s partition into sensibility, irritability, and reproduc-
    tion, see ¶172 and note. Plants reproduce themselves but lack sensibility and have only
    feeble irritability.
¶266. 1. All three functions concern the organism as a Selbstzweck, an                          ‘end-in-itself ’. Conse-
    quently all involve a ‘reflection into itself ’, the constitution of itself as a unitary object that
    has sensations of its own states and of other entities, reacts to external invasions, and
    produces both its own parts (‘singular’, rather than                  ‘individual’, since they lack independ-
    ence) and other individuals like itself.
¶267. 1. These organic systems are the outer side of the inner, mentioned in ¶264. The
    functions themselves, sensibility, etc., are not restricted to a particular location as their
    anatomical systems are, but pervade the whole organism.
¶268. 1. Specifically, organic laws relate all these items to one another. E.g. such and such a
    sensibility is expressed in such and such a nervous system or is correlated with such and
    such a reproductive function. The inner side, sensibility, etc., has its own outer side, e.g. the
    nervous system, which is distinct from the primary outer side—the body as a whole.
    Sensibility, e.g., is observable both in the nervous system and in the comportment of the
    whole body—since like the other functions, it is not confined to the location of its anatomical
    system.
¶270. 1. The psychic functions, sensibility, etc., are quite different from their anatomical bases,
    the nervous system, etc. They spread throughout the whole organism. Moreover, they are
    conceptually intertwined. There cannot be sensibility without irritability or irritability
    without sensibility. They cannot therefore vary in quantity. (Hyppolite, I, p.226, cites Karl
    Friedrich Kielmeyer’s dictum:              ‘Sensibility and irritability vary in inverse proportion’.)
    A given reaction might equally be explained by high sensibility and lower irritability, or
    by high irritability and lower sensibility. The assignment of relative quantities is thus
    arbitrary. (It is less clear how Hegel’s point applies to reproduction, especially as plants
    have it without the other functions.)
¶271. 1. Hegel’s generalized attack on quantification is unjustified. His examples concerning
    size, holes, and the number three are tautologies, but those concerning magnets, electricity,
    and acids and bases are not. The opposite poles of a magnet are in fact of equal strength, but
    there is no obvious contradiction in the idea of a monopolar magnet or of a magnet, one of
    whose poles is stronger than the other. Acids and bases need not be of the same strength.
    A certain quantity of strong alkali might be neutralized either by a similar quantity of strong
    acid or by a larger quantity of weak acid. On intensive and extensive magnitude, see Enc. I,
    ¶¶99, 103. Temperature is an intensive quantity whose degree can be measured by an
    extensive quantity, the height to which mercury rises in a thermometer. The strength of an
    acid is an intensive quantity and might be measured by the amount of it (extensive quantity)
    needed to neutralize a given amount of an alkali whose strength is also given. But it does not
    follow that intension and extension are equal. A large amount of a weak acid might, if
    I drink it, have a similar effect on me as a small amount of strong acid.
¶272. 1. Hegel seems to be mistaken. Intension and extension would be relevant, if e.g. we
    tried to measure the intensity of someone’s sensitivity to a stimulus by the speed of their
    irritable reaction to it.

¶274. 1. These supposed laws focus on the immediate outer or externality of the inner psychic
   functions, their anatomical bases, not on the functions themselves nor on the outer shape of
   the whole organism. They neglect the a priori relationships between the functions them-
   selves. Hegel turns to the outer of the organism as a whole in ¶¶283ff.
¶275. 1. If we turn to the manifestation of the psychic functions in the outer behaviour of
   organisms (‘Being-there’), then they become just like ordinary properties, such as weight,
   hardness, and colour, and their occurrence conforms to no law. Nature is not determined
   conceptually all the way down.
¶276. 1. On the deficiency of anatomy, see ¶53.
¶278. 1. The sides of a law are supposed (as Hume argued) to be stable and to be ‘indifferent’
   to   each other,       i.e.  not   conceptually       interrelated.     But an      organism      does     not satisfy
   these requirements. The relevant determinations will not stay                         fixed, but continually pass
   into each other. The ‘representation’ of a law, which gets lost, contrasts with the ‘thought’ of
   the law in ¶279.
¶279. 1. This law-giving is different from the law-giving of the understanding in ¶¶149ff. The
   understanding was aware of the sides of the law, but not of the relation between them. It had
   to make the transition from one side to the other for itself. Here, by contrast, the sides make
   the transition themselves before the very eyes of the understanding. The law that the outer is
   the expression of the inner (cf. ¶262) conveys the idea of this transition. It is a conceptual
   rather than an empirical truth and is the thought                  of law, not simply a representation of the
   specific laws which the understanding sought previously and still hankers for here. But now
   the understanding can no longer get a grip on intrinsically static sides needed for a law. The
   sides immediately succumb to the unrest of the concept.
¶280. 1. To find a side that engages with another side in a lawful manner, the understanding
   must invoke the organic functions as they are reflected into themselves, i.e. as they are in
   themselves, apart from their transitions into each other. But then they have no such
   determinate quality as redness or acidity that can enter into a contrast with other qualities.
   Their only determinacy is to continually exchange their determinacies, and then they slither
   out of understanding’s grasp. All that remains in them for the understanding to get hold of
   is their supposed difference in magnitude.
¶281. 1. Since the object is now seen as organic and governed by its concept, this understand-
   ing differs from the purely perceptual understanding of chapter III. However, it relapses
   into this earlier mode of understanding, just because, in deference to the exigencies of law-
   giving, it makes what it apprehends into                fixtures, susceptible to quantification. Nothing is
   gained by the conversion, in ¶280, of perceptible features into organic features reflected into
   themselves.
¶282. 1.    ‘Exponentiation’ (Potenzierung), the multiplication of a number by itself a given
   number of times, is a clear reference to Schelling, who had based his philosophy of nature
   on the idea of ‘powers’.
¶283. 1. This takes up the promise at the end of ¶274.
¶284. 1. The absence of law in the relation between an organism and its environment was seen
   in ¶255.
¶285. 1. There are three syllogistically related terms, (1) the shaped organism, which points
   outwards to (2) the Being-in-itself of its inorganic environment, and inwards to (3) its own
   inner Being-for-itself. (3) Is no longer conceived as a process involving the psychic
   functions and their anatomical bases, as it was earlier. It is entirely simple, an infinite
   ‘One’ (which has no quantitative significance, but expresses only the unity of an organism).
   There is, however, another factor, (4) undifferentiated life itself. It is not enough to ask why,
   given that there are polar bears at the north pole, their fur is thick and white. We also need
---
                                                                                                          

    to ask why there are any polar bears at all and why they are at the north pole while penguins
    are at the south pole. A number is the best answer we can give to this question: it is the
    middle term between undifferentiated life and the unitary shaped organism that emerges
    from it. (This number is distinct from the               ‘infinite One’: it looks ahead to specific gravity in
    ¶288.) There are no laws here: ‘it is a matter of indifference to this stream of life what kind of
    mills it drives’. It could have made no polar bears at all, it could have made them black and
    penguins white, and it could have reversed their habitats.
¶286. 1. The inner of the inner of the organism is undifferentiated life, the ‘unrest of abstrac-
    tion’. The inner of the outer of the organism is a ‘quiescent universality’, mere unity. Any hope
    of laws offered by the relation between the organism and undifferentiated life is shattered by
    the inert numerical simplicity of this second inner.
¶287. 1. The mutual indifference of the two sides and our loss of the organism’s reflection into
    itself means that we have not differentiated it from the inorganic. The essence of an
    inorganic entity is hidden inside it, or (as we may as well say) lies in our self-consciousness.
    The essence of an organism, by contrast, is accessible to us and not simply projected by us.
    We must therefore examine the inner-outer relation in the sphere where it really belongs, in
    the inorganic.
¶288. 1. Specific gravity is the ratio of the density of a substance relative to that of a standard
    substance, usually water at 4o C. So if water is assigned specific gravity of 1, substances with,
    e.g., a higher density are assigned a higher number than 1 and will sink in water. Specific
    gravity is observable, so it looks as if it could form one side of a law in which the other, outer,
    properties are correlated with it.
¶289. 1. See Enc. II, ¶¶293f. on specific gravity, and ¶¶295–9 on cohesion.
¶290. 1. The attempt to establish a series of bodies correlating their cohesion, or their specific
    gravity, with the rest of their properties is not only a failure, but also unduly selective, in
    view of the status of cohesion and specific gravity as ordinary properties. In fairness, we
    should take each of the other properties in turn as the representative of the essence and
    correlate    it with the remaining properties, which would now include specific gravity and
    cohesion. Hegel rightly disputes the possibility of a systematic classification of empirically
    encountered substances, but overlooks the possibility of a significant classification of
    chemical elements based on their atomic weights, such as Dmitri Mendeleev’s periodic
    table produced long after Hegel’s death. Hegel was in general averse to chemical elements
    (see   Enc. II, ¶¶281 and 328) and to atomism (see Enc. II, ¶333).
¶291. 1. Reason’s earlier attempt to explain the organic likened it to the inorganic. But now we
    see that the inner–outer relationship is quite different in the two cases. The supposed inner
    of an inorganic entity, its specific gravity, has no special status in it. It does not, for example,
    enable the entity to preserve itself: a fragment removed from the entity has the same specific
    gravity as the rest of it. An inorganic entity does not preserve itself in the face of other
    entities in the way that organisms do and, insofar as they are preserved, it is their cohesion
    rather than their specific gravity that makes this possible. The freedom of specific gravity
    consists only in its independence of a thing’s other properties and of other things. The self-
    maintenance of an organism, by contrast, is secured by its universal genus, not simply the
    type to which it belongs, but a universal form or plan that freely adapts the outer of the
    organism to face its environment. Such properties as specific gravity, and its numbers, now
    fall under the controlling power of the genus.
¶292. 1. There are three main items in play: (1) the genus is not just a category in a taxonomic
    classification, but a real universal inherent in singular organisms that powers and steers
    their development and their response to their environment. (2) Singular organisms cannot,
    however, be only generic. They must belong to a particular species and present generic
---
      

    features in a determinate form. Singular organisms also have features (including their
    number) that belong neither to the genus nor to the species. Such features are often
    adaptations to the organism’s particular environment and therefore depend on the free
    adaptive power of the genus, without being generic themselves. Such adaptations are
    governed by no law. (3) The species is a subdivision of a genus, mediating between this
    and singulars. Members of the same species resemble each other and interbreed. (Members
    of the same genus, but of different species, can interbreed but their offspring are infertile.)
    Hegel also introduces (4) the universal individual, such as air or earth: see Enc. II, ¶¶274–9,
    but only to deny that consciousness can be found there. The question how the genus relates
    to consciousness (full-scale human consciousness, not merely animal consciousness) arises
    because conscious reason is looking for itself, or its own position, in the natural world. The
    genus does not attain consciousness, because it has to pass through the particularizing sieve
    of the species. Cf. Enc. II, ¶370 on genus and species, esp. pp.421f: ‘It is this one-sidedness
    which makes one animal stand lower in the scale than another . . . In man, who is the
    fundamental type of organism, since he is the instrument of spirit, all sides attain their
    most perfect development.’
¶293. 1. In the Preface, ¶28, the ‘universal individual’ is ‘self-conscious spirit’. But here, as in
    ¶292, it is the inorganic environment, primarily earth. It forms one extreme of a syllogism.
    The other extreme is the genus, now promoted to                        ‘universal life’. (Hegel neglects the
    ‘family’, a higher category in taxonomic classification, comprising one or more genera.)
    As often, to preserve the triadic structure, two terms are combined to form a single middle
    term: the species and singular members of it.
¶294. 1. The genus has an intrinsic tendency to particularize itself into a series ordered
    numerically or perhaps in terms of shape, colour, etc. This does not do justice to the
    singular organism. But now we have another problem, the universal individual, the Earth.
    This has a share in deciding what species there are, the locations and number of their
    members, and their peculiar features.
¶295. 1. Species and their members stem directly from generic life in no rational order.
    Therefore generic life’s differentiation into them cannot be a self-systematizing develop-
    ment such as would allow it to have a coherent history. Determinate organisms do form a
    coherent contemporaneous system, but they are arrayed in it like points in space, each of
    which plays its part but none of which has priority over the others or monitors the whole
    system. The middle term of the syllogism of ¶294 is the species and singularity. If, by
    contrast, the middle term also contained the universal extremes, both the generic and the
    individual, it would be a self-systematizing development, powered by the concept rather
    than simply observed. This happens in the case of consciousness. The middle term between
    universal spirit and singularity is the shapes of consciousness, which implicitly involve both
    extremes and thus develop into an orderly system and into world-history. Enc. II, ¶249 also
    argues that species do not have a rational order such that lower, simple species could be
    supposed to have evolved into higher, complex species. The most that Hegel’s premises
    establish is that nature has no systematic, rational ‘history’ (Geschichte). But random change
    (Historie) does not interest him.
¶296. 1. Reason does not find itself in nature, except in the inadequate form of an intuition
    (rather than a conceptual comprehension) of universal life. Moreover, it sees the develop-
    ment of this life only in very general terms, since the specific and singular details are
    controlled by the Earth.
¶297. 1. Hegel here plays fast and loose with the words ‘meinen’ (‘mean, opine’) and ‘Meinung’
    (‘meaning, opinion’). They oscillate between referring to what life                          means, i.e. roughly
    intends, to do, but cannot quite manage, and reason’s opinions about nature.

b. Observation of self-consciousness in its purity and in its relation to external actuality.
Logical and psychological laws
¶298. 1. Inorganic nature supplies laws, but the laws are mere correlations, with no conceptual
    connection between the things correlated. Accordingly, it does not present a genuine
    individual, only correlated abstractions. By contrast, organic nature provides conceptual
    connection and genuine individuality, but the moments of life are not sufficiently differen-
    tiated to form the basis of laws. The satisfaction of both requirements—the concept existing
    freely and therefore constituting a self-contained individual, yet with enough articulation to
    develop lawfully—is found in self-consciousness itself.
¶299. 1. The laws of thought or                 ‘thinking’    (Denkens) are the laws of identity, of non-
    contradiction, etc.: see e.g. Enc. I, ¶20 Addition, and ¶115. In one sense, they lack truth,
    since they are purely formal and lack content. On the other hand, they essentially govern
    everything, and so have everything as their content. In another sense, too, they have content.
    Not only is our thinking governed by these laws, but we also think about the laws. Thinking,
    or the concept, essentially bifurcates and thinks about its own thoughts. So the formal laws
    become their own content.
¶300. 1.    ‘Knowledge’ (Wissen) means both what is known and the                          ‘knowing’ of it. Here, and
    below, it should probably be taken in the latter sense, as ‘knowing’ in parallel with ‘thinking’.
    However, Hegel draws no sharp distinction between what is known and our (way of)
    knowing it: what is known is always affected by our way of knowing it. See also ¶85.
        2. Observation just accepts these laws as it finds them. It treats them as sheer facts, quite
    separate from each other and from other thoughts. The unexplained plurality of laws contra-
    dicts the unity of self-consciousness and makes them an inadequate counterpart to reason itself.
    In fact, what deprives these laws of truth is not their lack of content, but the withdrawal of their
    form, the form that underpins their passage into each other and into other thoughts. Observa-
    tion does not see this. It becomes clear only in speculative philosophy, i.e. Hegel’s Logic.
¶301.    1. Observing consciousness is drawn towards active consciousness, since it must
    consider the consciousness governed by logical laws, and not leave them in limbo. But it
    doesn’t conceive active consciousness as the negative unity that dissolves the laws in the
    logical movement constituting the core of active consciousness. It leaves thinking with its
    static laws on one side and turns to a new object, consciousness as an active agent in the
    world, a consciousness that is also negative, but in a different way.
¶302. 1. In ¶301, consciousness was                ‘active’ (tuende(s), the present participle of tun), while
    here it is   ‘acting’  (handelnden, the present participle of handeln), which suggests practical
    activity rather than merely thinking. Psychological laws concern spirit’s reaction to the
    customs, etc. of its environment. On the one hand, it conforms to them as conferring
    universal actuality on itself. On the other hand, spirit selects from them what suits it. In both
    cases it is negative,       first against itself as uncultivated singularity, then against itself as
    cultivated by the universal. In the first case, it gives to its cultural environment only its
    own individuality, the form, while it takes all its content from the environment. The second
    case has various degrees: it may simply modify customs, etc., without contradicting them; or
    it may rebel against them, either in a singular way, as a criminal, or in a universal way, as a
    radical reformer (such as Napoleon).
¶303. 1. The ‘universal modes’ are spirit’s reactions to the surrounding culture in ¶302. (These
    were presumably not mutually exclusive. No one can be only a reflection of their culture
    with no idiosyncrasies, and any rebel must imbibe some of the culture he rebels against.)
    One of Hegel’s aims in Enc. III is to explain how a seemingly disparate collection of faculties,
    etc. are coherently unified in a single mind.
---
     

¶304. 1. Observation aligns itself with universal customs, etc. (It does not think of itself as
   simply a bundle of faculties.) On the other side is the human individual with its diverse
   faculties. To recount differences between individuals with respect to these faculties (e.g. by
   IQ tests) is misconceived, both because of the interconnections of the faculties within a
   unified mind and because of the surrounding customs, etc. But reason now proposes to find
   a law explaining the characteristics of individuals by their cultural environment.
¶305. 1. The environment is not inorganic in the sense of consisting only of minerals or
   containing no carbon, nor in the sense of not being alive as in e.g. ¶254, but in the
   metaphorical sense of an unindividualized environment, as in e.g. ¶175.
¶306. 1. The general state of the world explains the existence of individuals, but not, in any
   lawful way, the character of each individual. For first, given the individual’s ability to react to
   his environment in different ways, how he is influenced by the environment depends on the
   individual himself. He can only become such-and-such if he was such-and-such already (or at
   least had a tendency to become such-and-such). Secondly, to comprehend how the environ-
   ment formed a particular individual in a very definite way, we would need to see how his
   immediate environment took a very particular form, as particular and definite as the individual
   himself. Then we would have a duplicate of the individual himself, matching him as closely
   as the exterior and the interior of a sphere match each other. The ‘gallery of images’                    or
   pictures (Galerie von Bildern) recurs in ¶808, as the unfolding of historical stages, but not in
   duplicate.
¶307. 1. The exterior of the sphere, i.e. the particularized immediate environment of the
   individual, is both the world of the individual and the worldly situation as it is intrinsically,
   apart from the individual. The individual can either absorb the worldly situation or invert it:
   cf. ¶302. The world of the individual, therefore, can be comprehended only from the
   individual, not from the objective worldly situation. This combines the two objections of
   ¶306: the individual is as free in its reaction to its particularized environment as it is in its
   reaction to its environment in general.
¶308. 1. The law required two sides: the objective world present in itself (Being in and for
   itself, Being that is present) and the individual for itself (Being that is made). But the
   individual has now absorbed these two sides into its own world, the closed circle of its own
   activity, leaving the objective world out in the cold. The two putative sides are too closely
   intertwined in the individual to constitute a law. If we do try to separate them by locating
   the world outside the individual, then there is no necessary relationship between this
   objective world and the individual.
c. Observation of the relation of self-consciousness to its immediate actuality. Physiognomy
and phrenology
¶309. 1. The ‘immediate actuality’ mentioned in the sub-title is now the individual’s body, not
   his environment. Being-for-itself was the individual and Being-in-itself his environment,
   but they are now fused together in the autonomous individual.
¶310. 1. A distinction between Being-for-itself and Being-in-itself arises, parallel to that
   between the individual and its environment, but now within the individual. As for itself,
   the individual is free activity and consciousness; as in itself, it is its own body, prior to and
   presupposed by its activity. However the individual is only what it has done. So besides
   being its original nature, the body is an expression of the individual, produced by its past
   activity. The body is not just a            ‘Thing’    (Sache, but here equivalent to Ding), but a sign,
   revealing what the individual is by the use it has made (and will presumably continue to
   make) of its body. That the individual is only what it has done is close to Hegel’s own belief
   that a man’s true Being or actuality is his deed: see ¶322. But here it is an essential premise of
   the doctrines he is about to criticize. Their claim that someone’s character is infallibly
---
                                                                                             

   revealed by his body, or a part of it, presupposes that this part is entirely shaped by his past
   actions, with nothing left to the vagaries of nature.
¶311. 1. Here the human bodily shape (or the bodily shape of a particular human group) is
   analogous to the customs, etc. of ¶¶305f., while the particular shape of an individual is
   analogous to the particular cultural environment of an individual in ¶306. Corresponding to
   the individual’s free activity in the face of its environment, the individual now expresses its
   character and consciousness in its shape. Now each of the two sides forms the whole
   individual, seen from one side. The outer body comprises both the fixed parts and the
   effects on them of the individual’s past and present doings. It expresses the inner side, which
   is no longer indeterminate as before, but has a definite character, which—unlike the body—
   is not produced by the individual itself.
¶312. 1. An individual’s use of its bodily organs does not serve our purpose. We should
   distinguish between the doing and the deed, the activity and its product or ‘work’. The
   doing expresses the inner too much: it is the inner itself rather than the expression of it. The
   deed expresses the inner too little, since it is open to manipulation by the agent and
   misinterpretation by others.
¶313. 1. What we need is some aspect of the bodily shape that is not an organ or its doing
   nor an external product. It should be static, but with features that, while intrinsically
   meaningless, are a sign of the inner. It would be like a language, whose sounds are
   intrinsically meaningless and unconnected with the Thing signified, but are linked with it
   contingently by our free conventions. On the comparison with language, see also ¶¶323,
   342, and 343.
¶314. 1. Astrology, palmistry, etc. are such quasi-linguistic sciences, but they provide no
   essential connection between the signs and what they signify. The assignment of meanings
   to the signs is arbitrary. Physiognomy purports to have overcome this difficulty by finding a
   necessary connection between the inner character and the bodily expressed character.
   Johann Kaspar Lavater (1741–1801) published Physiognomische Fragmente zur Beförderung
   der Menschenkenntnis und Menschenliebe [Physiognomic Fragments for the Promotion of
   Knowledge and Love of Humanity] (1775–1778).
¶315. 1. The Athenian statesman, Solon, is reputed to have said ‘Count no man happy until he
   is dead’, meaning that one needs to consider a whole life before pronouncing a verdict on it.
   Hegel does not accept the palmist’s short cut, but nevertheless regards the hand, which, after
   the tongue, is the main instrument of one’s activity, as closely linked with the inner nature
   responsible for one’s fate.
¶316. 1. In ¶312 we considered an organ only with respect to what it does and what it
   produces. But now we have found an aspect of it that is its Being rather than its doing or
   deed. The lines on hands, the sound of a voice, and the style of handwriting are relatively
   constant features of these organs, distinct both from the individual’s inner character, which
   is innate but also moulded by culture, and from the external doings and deeds leading to his
   fate. They might therefore be an observable middle term between these two extremes.
¶317. 1. This idea is extended beyond the hand and the voice to the face and the posture, even
   though they are not involved in the doing. Their movements indicate externally the
   individual’s reflection on his own doings and deeds, his inner speech about them. ‘Super-
   vision’ translates Beaufsichtigen, a close relative of Beabsichtigen (‘intending’) in ¶319. Hegel
   here moves beyond strict physiognomy, which, in Lavater’s view, is concerned only with
   fixed features of the face, not with temporary facial gestures and expressions. The latter
   belong to ‘pathognomy’ rather than physiognomy. Later, in Enc. III, ¶¶401 and 411, Hegel
   draws this distinction. In PS he conflates them, especially in order to sharpen the contrast
   between physiognomy and phrenology, which provides no counterpart to pathognomy: see
   ¶¶325ff. See also Inwood (2016).

¶318. 1. Hegel’s quotations are from Über Physiognomik (1778), a response by Georg Christoph
    Lichtenberg (1742–1799) to Lavater. This quotation is from p.35 of the 1778 second edition of
    Lichtenberg’s work.
        2. A facial expression is different from the deed and may show that the agent is not
    serious. But it is related as a sign only contingently to what it signifies and may, like any
    other sign, be manipulated as a mask. In that case, the individual locates his essence in his
    will and in the action or deed, which, in Hegel’s view, is where it was all along.
¶319. 1. In ¶318 the individual had a choice over where to locate its essence and, in order to
    defeat the physiognomist, decided to locate it in his                ‘work’ [Werk]. The physiognomist, by
    contrast, believes that what is essential is the inner intention rather than the deed. We have
    here an opposition between the practical, action, and the theoretical, reflection on the
    action. Theoretical reflection on the deed is really intending (Beabsichtigen), since intending
    is the agent’s opinion about his action: cf. ‘supervision’ (Beaufsichtigen) of one’s doing in
    ¶317. The shape or gesture of the individual conveys his intention, and together they are
    spirit opined or meant. In this opined or meant Being-there, the physiognomist looks for
    laws. Hegel is here playing with the verb meinen, which means both ‘opine, suppose’ and
    ‘mean, intend’, as in chapter I. He is suggesting that physiognomy elevates intentions above
    overt actions and also that it deals in unsubstantiated opinions. Thus the intention is what
    the agent means by, or his opinion about, his action (this equation is surely false: my
    intention to write a great book is not the same as my opinion that I am writing a great book).
    Spirit and Being-there are opined by the physiognomist rather than by the agent under
    observation.
¶320. 1. We practise          natural    physiognomy when we make snap judgements of people’s
    characters on the basis of their appearance. We do not first see their appearance in a
    neutral, purely sensory way and then infer their character, e.g. their arrogance, from it. We
    immediately see someone as arrogant. Their appearance for us is saturated with their inner
    nature and is the visibility of the invisible. Observation, by contrast, focuses on sheer
    sensory appearance and tries to infer the inner from it. It does not risk falsification by
    classifying people as murderers, etc., but simply postulates a ‘capacity’ to murder, an inner
    tendency or disposition that will, in favourable circumstances, be actualized. It needs far
    more elaborate descriptions to capture the complexity of an individual character, just as it
    does to capture the complexity of a human face. Despite its pretensions to knowledge it
    remains opinion throughout.
¶321. 1. Physiognomy relies on the fact that spirit reflects itself into itself out of itself, or
    distances itself from its sensory Being-there, such as its speech and actions, yet inconsist-
    ently denies that it can distance itself from its facial structure and gestures. The concluding
    quotation is from Lichtenberg (1778), p.72.
¶322. 1. The quotation is from p.6 of the 1778 edition of Lichtenberg’s work. The gallant
    fellow’s response shows that a man’s face is not his actuality, since it is alterable: cf. ¶339
    on smashing the skull of a phrenologist. This does not entail that a man’s true Being is
    his deed, but Hegel gives reasons, of varying merit, for this claim: (1) a deed is dynamic,
    rather than static, and essentially negates Being, e.g. the physiognomist’s face; (2) a deed
    is clear-cut and describable in terms available to all; (3) a deed is not a mere sign: if a
    man commits a murder, it follows that he is a murderer. He also dismisses two
    objections: (i) a deed is external: it does not reveal the man’s mind. Nevertheless, if a
    man’s deed or work (Werk) conflicts with his professed intentions, etc. or with their
    supposed bodily expression, priority should be given to the deed or work. (ii) A deed or
    work may be altered or misinterpreted by others: cf. ¶312. But this only shows what
    the work was all along: the significance of e.g. a poem depends on its readers’ responses
    to it, not on the poet’s intentions. Hegel here moves from a critique of physiognomy to

                                                                                                            

    a critique of the (e.g. Kantian) view that intentions matter more than actions: cf. ¶319.
    See also Inwood (2016).
¶323. 1. In physiognomy (which Hegel conflates with pathognomy: see ¶317) the winks and
    nods that express someone’s character are a sort of speech, revealing his inner self-
    monitoring and conversation with himself; even his                      fixed features have been affected by
    his past inner speech. In phrenology, by contrast, no such inner or outer speech is involved,
    because the bumps and hollows on a skull are immobile. They are therefore not a talking
    sign of someone’s character, but simply a correlate of it.
¶324. 1. Franz Joseph Gall (1758–1828) developed phrenology, or craniology, in lectures from
    the 1790s. Gall argued that the brain is the organ of the mind; that it is not homogeneous,
    but contains different organs, with different functions and situated in different places; that
    the size of a brain-organ indicates its relative strength; and that these organs causally affect
    the shape of the skull.
¶325. 1. To causally affect the body spirit must be, or have, an internal bodily organ (a brain),
    in which spirit is reflected into itself and keeps to itself. In physiognomy the organ (the face)
    is also an organ reflected into itself and commenting on the individual’s activity, but it is a
    visible object; the individual is indifferent to its actuality (its face) and can manipulate it.
    This indifference ceases when the inward reflectedness is                         causally   effective. It is then
    necessarily related to Being-there (the skull) via the brain. Phrenology repairs a defect in
    physiognomy. If the outer is just a quasi-linguistic sign it can be overridden and exploited.
    But causal power cannot be overridden. (Pathognomy is more easily exploited than strict
    physiognomy. But even the latter can be overridden: e.g. a man diagnosed by a physi-
    ognomist as a pacifist might freely commit murder just to defeat him. A phrenologist would
    say that, if his diagnosis is correct, he would be physically incapable of murder.)
¶326. 1. See Plato’s Timaeus, 71c–e.
¶327. 1. There are three terms in play: (1) the mind or spirit, as Being-within-itself, is complex
    and differentiates itself into moments. But it is                  fluid and moving, not segmented into
    separate compartments. In accordance with its complexity, it articulates (2) the                                whole
    body   into different parts, each with its own function. It does this by way of the middle
    term, (3) the brain. The brain does not go outward. Insofar as it does so and becomes Being-
    there, Being-for-another (in contrast to mere Being), it becomes dead Being (the skull).
    Since the brain mediates between (1) and (2), it must have something in common with both
    and therefore contain the moments of (1), but articulated into separate compartments,
    somewhat in the manner of (2). (Some, but not all, of these claims represent Hegel’s own
    views. He is giving the motivation of a doctrine he goes on to reject.)
¶328. 1. An example of Hegel’s humour, suggesting that the genitals might equally be
    regarded as the location of spirit.
        2. There is now another syllogistic triad. The spiritual-organic Being, i.e. the mind or
    spirit, causally affects an inert Being-there (the skull) by way of a middle term, the brain,
    which is the corporeal Being-for-itself of spirit. (This is quite different from the syllogism of
    ¶327, where the bodily extreme was the whole body, with no mention of the skull.) After
    some playful mockery of the way in which it is decided that the second two terms are the
    brain and the skull (rather than the spinal cord and the vertebral column), Hegel denies that
    the skull is an organ, since we do not murder, etc. with the skull as we see with the eye. This
    denial is irrelevant for two reasons. First, in ¶325, when it was suggested that the brain is an
    organ, a distinction was drawn between an organ of this type and an organ used as an
    external instrument. Secondly, the phrenologist claims not that the skull is an organ—it
    obviously is not, apart from serving to protect the brain—but that the brain is an organ, but
    an organ of a special type, which does not entail that we murder, etc. with the brain. A caput
    mortuum      is a ‘dead head’ or useless remnants.

¶329. 1. What causes what? Do spiritual motions and modes of the brain cause the shape of
   skull? Or is it the other way round? In whichever direction the causal arrow points, there
   would be same correlation of skull-shape with spiritual features. But if the skull were the
   cause, this would make it Being-for-itself and the immediate organ of self-consciousness.
   Other alternatives are that the causal action is reciprocal or that the development of each is
   determined by some third factor (a pre-established harmony) or even that each develops
   independently, so that there is no correlation whatsoever. (Gall argued that the skull hardens
   over the brain during infancy and is then subject to the causal influence of the brain.)
¶330. 1. Cantharadin is a chemical compound secreted by several species of beetle, notably the
   Spanish     fly, once used as an aphrodisiac: another example of Hegel’s earthy humour.
       2. Hegel rightly doubts Gall’s claims about the causal influence of the brain on the skull
   and about the correlation of brain-functions with skull features. However, he wrongly
   denies that the brain is an aggregate of spatially located organs. His argument is that ‘nature’
   already gives the moments of the concept, which as such are                            ‘fluid simplicity’ and not
   spatially located, a Being-there of their own in the articulation of the whole body. He
   invokes the articulated body of the syllogism in ¶327, but neglects the articulated brain that
   was there the middle term between spirit and the whole body. In ¶327, there were three
   sides, not only two: (1) spirit, with different moments, but not spatially located or separate;
   (2) the whole body with diverse organs with different functions; and (3) the brain whose
   diverse functions are localized, but not in the same way as the functions of bodily organs.
   The brain is not just a small-scale model of the body. Then the phrenologist adds (4), the
   skull whose bumps and hollows mirror the distribution of functions in the brain, but not in
   the whole body. Hegel tends to elide the distinction between the mind and the brain. This
   was heralded in ¶328 when he spoke of ‘the spiritual-organic Being’, and again in ¶329 when
   he combined ‘spiritual moments and the determinate modes of the brain’, as well as by his
   refusal to call the brain the organ of spirit.
¶331. 1.    ‘Meaning’ here, and in ¶332, is Bedeutung, not Meinung. Bedeutung is the normal
   word for ‘meaning’         or ‘significance’.
       2. In ¶330 Hegel contracted the triad of ¶327 into a dyad. Here he performs the same
   operation on the triad of ¶328. Instead of three terms, spirit-brain-skull, we now have only
   two: the brain as the Being of the self-conscious individuality and the Being-there of the
   skull. The brain as an animal part drops out in favour of a spiritualized brain, that combines
   brain and spirit, and thereby elides the distinction between them. We might expect Hegel to
   say that the     brain   is the ‘actuality and Being-there’ of a man. But instead he says it is the
   skull. This is both because the brain in question is conflated with spirit and because neither
   type of brain actualizes a man and constitutes his Being-there, his presence in the outside
   world.
¶333. 1.    Hamlet, V.1.
       2. Hegel repeats that we do not murder, etc. with the skull: cf. ¶328. This is only relevant
   insofar as it bears on the claim that the skull is a man’s actuality, a claim that Hegel foists on
   the phrenologist. Something, such as a frown, counts as a sign if there is no apparent reason
   for its occurrence unless it indicates something else. It may be intentionally produced in
   order to indicate something else (e.g. a knot in a handkerchief ) or it may not (e.g. a frown, a
   smile). There is, however, another sense of ‘sign’ in which something is a sign, or indication,
   of something else (e.g. ‘a high forehead is a sign of intelligence’) even if its occurrence does
   not need to be accounted for in this way. The phrenologist regards skull-bumps as signs in
   this latter sense, not in Hegel’s sense.
¶335. 1. Genesis 22:17; Isaiah 10:22; Hosea 1:10; Romans 9:27; Hebrews 11:12.
        2. There is no necessary relationship between skull-features and spiritual features, not
   even a clear correlation, let alone any speech. If we have an impoverished conception of

    spirit, it becomes easier, since there are fewer spiritual features and they are separate and
    rigid, like skull-features. But there are still very many and the assignment of a skull-area to
    each is arbitrary. A murderer is not just an abstraction. He has many other spiritual and
    skull features; the assignment of murder to a specific bump is impossible. A murderous
    tendency can be counteracted by another spiritual feature; if spiritual features were
    detached and ossified, a potential murderer would be bound to murder, but that is not
    so. Murder may be committed for diverse reasons; there is no specific murderous
    function. Correlating skull features to spiritual functions leads to an ossified conception
    of spirit. (Gall’s simple moralizing account of spiritual and brain functions exposes him to
    Hegel’s critique.)
¶336. 1. Phrenological correlations are an abstract logical and imaginable possibility, as is the
    belief of natural phrenology that a cuckold has bumps on his head. But it is not a real, inner
    possibility. On this distinction see          Enc. I, ¶143.
¶337. 1. The phrenologist tries to accommodate freedom by allowing that spirit is not
    originally    fixed, but consists of predispositions which are in the individual’s own power
    and need favourable circumstances to develop, as well as to be actualized. E.g. one might
    suppress one’s murderous predisposition or find no occasion to actualize it. So if observa-
    tions contradict the supposed law, and it does not rain on washday (cf. ¶321), they say it
    really ought to rain, the disposition to rain is there, or that someone ought to be as his skull
    indicates, he has the original disposition, only it hasn’t developed. But in fact Being, both the
    original spirit and the developed skull, is irrelevant to the freedom of the individual and to
    circumstances. One is free to override one’s original internal endowment, let alone one’s
    skull. (Hegel stresses that the housewife’s generalization is based on observation of actual
    rainfall, but avoids saying what role observations of people’s                         actions—the analogue of
    rainfall—play, or should play, in the generalizations of the phrenologist.)
¶339. 1. Phrenology’s acknowledgement of freedom and its resort to dispositions in ¶337
    implicitly concedes that spiritless Being cannot be the truth of consciousness, since con-
    sciousness only actualizes itself by negating Being. A bone cannot be the actual Being-there
    of consciousness. But if it were the exterior                of consciousness, it would also be its actual
    Being-there, since the exterior is just ‘the actuality that is’ (die seiende Wirklichkeit). The
    skull cannot just be the evidence or expression of a man’s interior. Once we accept that the
    skull expresses his interior, we must accept, erroneously, that it is his actuality, since it is the
    only actualization of his interior available.
       It is unclear why the phrenologist cannot maintain that the skull is simply evidence of a
    man’s interior. There are, after all, three sides involved, not just inner thinking and the skull,
    but also the man’s actions. Why could a phrenologist not agree with Hegel that only a man’s
    actions actualize his interior fully—since a man is not a murderer unless he actually
    commits murder, and observation of actual murders, etc. is surely needed in order to
    support phrenological generalizations—yet argue that the skull gives evidence of a man’s
    likely actions? Unless Hegel is simply suppressing the role of actions in the phrenologist’s
    calculations (cf. ¶337), it is perhaps because he assumes that if the evidence of the skull
    conflicts with that of overt behaviour, the phrenologist will always                      find a way of favouring
    the evidence of the skull (cf.         ‘ought’ in ¶337). On smashing the skull, cf. ¶322.
¶340. 1. Instinctively reason will reject the result it has reached in its observation, viz.
    phrenology, though, unlike us, it may not see where it has gone astray. But here, at its
    lowest point, observing reason is also close to its highest point: it has glimpsed cognition,
    but misconceived it unspiritually. In converting spirit’s interior into an ossified unspiritual
    Being expressed by a mere thing, self-conscious reason has reached its nadir and must go
    into reverse, i.e. move to a new position which is, in a sense, a return to its starting-point,
    but now on a higher level. The new position will be the opposite of its present one: see Enc. I,

    opposite’. On Jews, see Hegel (1948), pp.177–205.
¶341. 1. This and the two following ¶¶ recapitulate the whole experience of observing reason.
    Its progression through the inorganic and organic involved a gradual detachment of things
    from sensory Being and the emergence of the universal concept. The purpose-concept,
    introduced in ¶256, led away from the mere freedom in itself of the organic to the freedom
    for itself of spirit, where the concept is finally extricated from its sensory integument and
    reason has found itself. However, as we shall see in ¶343, reason ended up reducing self-
    consciousness to a dead physical thing and thus returning to its beginning in a circular
    movement.
¶342. 1. This ¶ recapitulates ¶¶298ff. on logical and psychological laws. Glossing over the
    latter, it passes on to physiognomy, in combination, as usual, with pathognomy: cf. ¶319.
¶343. 1. Phrenology turns from the inconstant language of physiognomy-cum-pathognomy
    to the security of fixed Being. The immediate actuality of spirit is not an organ, language, or
    a sign, but a dead bone, a mere thing. This is not what the phrenologist ‘means’ (meint); he
    does not mean to advocate materialism. But that is what he says. Observing reason has
    thereby returned full circle to its beginning. Hegel suggests that not only phrenology, but
    also ordinary ways of speaking about spirit imply an unwitting materialism.
¶344. 1. In Kant’s CPR, A71/B96, an                   ‘infinite judgement’, in contrast to an affirmative
    judgement (e.g. ‘The soul is mortal’) and a negative judgement (e.g. ‘The soul is not mortal’),
    has an affirmative form, but a negative sense (e.g. ‘The soul is non-mortal’). Such judge-
    ments are infinite, because their status is indefinite, wavering between positivity and
    negativity. Hegel gives a different, and more interesting, account of infinite judgements.
    His examples, in Enc. I, ¶173, are ‘The spirit is not an elephant’ and ‘A lion is not a table’,
    which he says are ‘correct, but absurd’. These are negative infinite judgements, whereas ‘The
    Self is a thing’ is a positive infinite judgement, and presumably incorrect, as well as absurd.
    Both types of judgement are regarded as ‘infinite’, because the predicates affirmed or denied
    lie beyond the (finite) range of predicates categorically compatible with the subject.
        2. This ¶ considers the result from Hegel’s own conceptual point of view. It involves a
    re-examination of the course of PS. The original unhappy consciousness of ¶¶207ff.
    projected itself as a thing, thereby ceasing to be self-consciousness and becoming merely
    consciousness of a thing. In its modern counterpart, phrenology, the thing is not simply an
    object of consciousness, but self-consciousness itself. So this thing is the category, the unity
    of the I and Being. In ¶235 the category was simply the I, but it combined with sensory
    Being to form objective beings. Here it combines with Being in a different way, becoming
    just a thingly being itself. Since the category is the object of consciousness, consciousness
    has   reason; in itself it      is reason, but for now it only            has reason: see also ¶440 on the
    distinction between         having    reason and       being   reason. The category must pass through
    the two forms it combines—Being and one’s own, the I. For observing consciousness it
    takes the form of Being. But this immediate relation between the two is severed by an
    infinite judgement and the thing is now regarded as an object to be overcome, not just
    accepted; consciousness now becomes proper self-consciousness: see ¶¶347ff. That is, the
    category now passes from the form of Being, into that of Being-for-itself, the I or one’s own.
    Instead of hoping just to find itself, consciousness now aims to produce itself, as in ¶¶347ff.
    (This ¶ is difficult, since Hegel is sketching the future course of PS. Although Kant was not a
    phrenologist, it may help to compare his CPR, where the I or ‘I think’ deploys categories to
    transform sensations into beings, but is not itself subject to categorization nor an entity
    within the world formed by the categories. Such an I has reason, but is                           not reason. The
    I more fully enters into the world in Kant’s Critique of Practical Reason, which considers
    morality, as does PS ¶¶347ff.)

¶346. 1. The proposition that spirit is a bone is a representation. Underlying it is the
    conceptual proposition that reason is all thinghood, etc., but it is this only in the concept,
    and if the conceptual version is turned into a representation, it becomes absurd. To avoid
    this we must take the proposition ‘The Self is a thing’ in its self-sublating infinitude, and
    then it contains the truth of idealism; but it is absurd if the subject and predicate are taken as
    fixed. That is, the proposition can be interpreted in three ways: (i) a straightforward
    identification of the two; (ii) a reduction of the Self to a thing; or (iii) a reduction (or
    perhaps elevation) of a thing to the Self or spirit. (These three propositions might be
    presented schematically as, respectively: S = T, S => T, and T => S.) Proposition (i) is just
    absurd, equating items that are presupposed as different, (ii) expresses a crude materialism that
    is also absurd, while (iii) expresses an inchoate but respectable idealism. See also ¶¶790ff.,
    where Hegel summarizes the phrenologist’s infinite judgement and its subsequent fate. How-
    ever, Hegel’s own idealism is more dynamic than that expressed in (iii) and might be
    more appropriately formalized as S <=> T, suggesting a reciprocal movement between the
    Self, or the concept, and things. Things are real for Hegel, and not simply absorbed into the Self.

B .  THE ACTUALIZATION OF RATIONAL SELF - CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGH ITSELF
¶347. 1. This transition was heralded in the latter part of ¶344. Reason ceases to regard the
    thing as simply immediate. It is rather a surface beneath which lies self-consciousness itself.
    Since the object is still a thing and therefore independent, it is another self-consciousness,
    which recognizes, and is recognized by, itself. Self-consciousness is now on the way to spirit
    proper, the     ‘I that is We, and We that is I’         of ¶177. In this and the following ¶¶ the words
    ‘thing’   and   ‘thinghood’       shed the pejorative         flavour they had earlier and now suggest
    independence and objectivity, no longer dead Being.
¶348. 1. Observing reason corresponds to sensory certainty in description (¶245), to percep-
    tion in the classification of organisms, and to understanding in its search for laws. Active
    reason will similarly repeat the two sections of chapter IV: A. ‘Independence and depend-
    ence of self-consciousness’ (¶¶178ff.) and B. ‘Freedom of self-consciousness’ (¶¶197ff.) This
    section of chapter V will correspond to the former, and the third section of V (¶¶394ff.) will
    correspond to the latter. At first the journey will be undertaken by the individual con-
    sciousness, but later by the collective consciousness. The singular self-consciousness moves
    gradually towards spirit proper, the real substance that underlies all the earlier shapes of
    consciousness.
¶349. 1. The concept of spirit as a system of mutually recognizing self-consciousnesses has
    ‘arisen for us’ in ‘I that is We, and We that is I’ of ¶177, and in ¶¶206f. ‘Ethical life’ translates
    Sittlichkeit, customary social morality, in contrast to individual Moralität, morality in the
    Kantian sense. The word is derived from Sitte, ‘custom’. ‘Moralität’ also derives from a word
    for custom, the Latin         ‘mos, mores’, and so too does the word ‘ethic(al)’, from the Greek
    ‘ethos’, but the etymology of ‘Sittlichkeit’ is more noticeable in German. The ‘law in thought’
    (das  gedachte Gesetz) does not measure up to its actual reality, as is seen in the inadequate
    quasi-Kantian attempts to formalize it in ¶¶419ff. and 429ff. Custom and ethical life are not
    an extraneous addition to the individual, but permeate its whole Being.
¶350. 1. The relation between ethical life and individuals is comparable to that between
    ‘langue’ and ‘parole’. As there could be no individual speakers without a language and,
    conversely, no language without individual speakers, so ethical life and individuals are
    interdependent. Individuals are more or less conscious of this interdependency and of the
    sacrifice it involves of their idiosyncrasy. We might be reminded here of Hegel’s conception
    of ‘the true not as substance, but just as much as subject’ (¶17).
¶351. 1. The individual can only satisfy his own needs in virtue of belonging to a universal
    medium that enables him to work to satisfy the needs of others, who in return work to
---
     

   satisfy his needs. This is the system that, in PR, Hegel calls ‘civil society’. He was deeply
   influenced by Adam Smith and other British economists. The single individual is not fully
   aware of the economic system in which he participates, but he is aware of the overall social
   project to which he contributes, since in its customs and laws the universal substance, that
   combines one’s Being for another and one’s Being-for-oneself, speaks a universal language
   intelligible to all.
¶352. 1. As often, ‘determination’ here means ‘destination’. In ethical life the individual has
   reached his destination. It is not something that he merely                            ought    to attain but that
   continually eludes his grasp, as in Kantian morality.
¶353. 1. ¶¶351 and 352 sketched the goal, but in the main course of this section self-
   consciousness has not yet reached it, only the concept of it. We need to consider the stages
   by which it arrives at the goal. We can consider this from two points of view, supposing,
   first, that self-consciousness has withdrawn from a fulfilled spirit that it once had (see ¶¶354
   and 355) and, secondly, that it is has not yet reached it (see ¶356). To do so we will have to
   explore the permutations of morality, not only ethical life.
¶354. 1. In immediate ethical life people simply accept their customs and laws. They do not
   analyse or reflect on them—until someone like Socrates or Plato comes on the scene.
   The ethical order is therefore only in itself, not for itself, and is limited. When they do
   become aware of the nature of their society, it loses this limitation. Such reflection is
   inevitable, since reason can accept no impassable limit (cf. ¶80) and thereby withdraws
   from this simple order.
¶355. 1. The growth of individualism is inevitable, since the independent singleton is still a
   factor in simple ethical life, even if he emerges only fleetingly. But, like every moment of the
   essence, the singleton must sooner or later assert himself as the essence itself, free not only to
   reflect on laws and customs, but to accept or reject them at will. This dissolves the solid trust
   that bound him to his society and transforms him from a                      ‘singleton’   into a full ‘individual’.
¶356. 1. Hegel now turns to the other supposition of ¶353. Spirit emerges from observing
   reason as a singular consciousness, in search of the happiness it expects to find, or produce,
   in unity with other self-consciousnesses. Unlike the preceding supposition this does not
   correspond to any obvious historical occurrence, but to the logical sequence of Hegel’s
   thoughts. This suggests a tension between the historical and logical sequences. However,
   Hegel also has in mind an alienated modern individual, seeking a restoration of the secure
   order lost in the French revolution, Kantian morality, etc.
¶357. 1. Hegel’s text has only the pronoun derselben, which might refer either to the ethical
   substance (Miller, Hyppolite) or to the impulses (Jarczyk–Labarrière). The former is a more
   natural reading of the German, but the latter makes better sense of the introduction of
   morality.
       2. On both suppositions of ¶353, self-consciousness proceeds from an individualism, for
   which the essence lies in one’s own natural impulses and their satisfaction, to an integration
   into ethical substance. Hegel inverts the order in which the suppositions were presented in
   ¶¶353–6, now considering, first, the supposition that individualism precedes ethical life and,
   secondly, the supposition that ethical life precedes individualism. In both cases the indi-
   vidual follows a similar path, gradually overcoming his attachment to unrefined impulses,
   and the     ‘shapes’    in which they figure, and subordinating them to an ethical order. The
   second case is more complex. The individual sheds his illusions about impulses and rises to
   the level of ethical substance. He does so in part by invoking morality, not the morality that
   emerged from the ethical substance itself, but morality as it results from individual self-
   consciousness. Morality is a higher stage than ethical life, since it involves reflection and
   self-consciousness. Hence the ethical substance restored is not the primitive version that
   was lost, but is combined with reflection and self-consciousness. Hegel describes the second
---
                                                                                                              

    case in such a way as to make it a more fitting model of modern individualism. His reason
    for preferring it may be that it          fits the course of history better.
¶359. 1. This sketches the overall plan of section B. Self-consciousness is bent on realizing
    itself. It regards actuality, primarily other self-consciousnesses, as a                     field on which it can
    impose its own purpose. In subsection a) ‘Pleasure and necessity’, it treats another self-
    consciousness as itself, i.e. it attempts to reduce the other to an appendage of itself. In b)
    ‘The law of the heart’        (¶¶367ff.), it abandons this self-centred individualism in favour of a
    universal project of moral reform that takes account of other individuals as well as itself, but
    is still only its own project. In c) ‘Virtue’ (¶¶381ff.), it sacrifices its residual self-centredness
    and abandons its universal project, focusing instead on the cultivation of virtue. Its
    experience of this project leads into section C (¶¶394ff.), where an attempt is made to
    close the gap between self-consciousness and external actuality, and especially to its first
    subsection,     ‘The spiritual animal kingdom’               (¶¶397ff.), where the individual sets out to
    express himself in an unresisting actuality.

a. Pleasure and necessity
¶360. 1. A free quotation from Goethe’s                   Faust, Part I of 1790, which inspires this whole
    section. The reference to ‘theory’ as a grey shadow alludes to Mephistopheles’s words: ‘My
    worthy friend, grey are all theories/And green alone life’s golden tree’. Self-consciousness
    has, like Faust himself, abandoned observing reason’s theoretical approach to Being and
    now exploits it for its own pleasure.
¶361. 1. As ¶364 reveals, the expression ‘es nimmt sich das Leben’, translated as                            ‘it takes hold
    of life’, can also mean ‘it takes its own life’, i.e. kills itself.
¶362. 1. Desire here does not, as it did in ¶¶167ff., aim at the destruction of its object, but only
    at removing its semblance of independence. The independence of the two, unlike that of
    desiring self-consciousness and its object in chapter IV, is underpinned by the category, not
    just by living Being-there. Each party is conscious of its independence, whether it be by the
    representation of simple natural consciousness or by a more rational lawful consciousness.
    Self-consciousness is ambivalent. On the one hand, it regards the other self-consciousness as
    an appendage of itself. On the other hand, its pleasure depends on the other’s perceived
    independence. Once it achieves its aim of union with the other, it is no longer just itself, but
    merged together with the other, hence no longer a mere singleton but a universal. (Goethe’s
    Faust seduces Margaret, who then has a child; she drowns it and is condemned to death.
    Hegel may have this episode in mind. One possibility is that the singleton must pass from
    one hapless victim to the next, becoming a universal seducer. Alternatively, or additionally,
    Hegel may have in mind a marriage, in which the victim of seduction later becomes a wife,
    reasserts her independence, and puts the former singleton in his place.)
¶363. 1. The object of self-consciousness’s pleasure negates it rather than fulfils it. This empty,
    yet overpowering object, is an incipient form of self-consciousness itself, which instantiates
    only an abstract category uniting Being-for-itself and Being-in-itself. Yet since self-
    consciousness is no longer the simple Being of phrenology, other categories of thinghood
    come into play. They are extruded from self-consciousness itself and cast out into the world.
    The categories of unity, difference, and their relation form a conceptually interconnected
    circle. Together they constitute a blind fate or necessity, which is, like themselves, empty,
    but irresistible. Self-consciousness now conceives of itself as a lifeless thing, driven on by an
    empty and alien necessity. (This sounds more like Don Juan’s endless seductions than
    Hegel’s premonition of his future marriage.)
¶364. 1. The One is the singular self-consciousness, while the universality is its fate, which
    drives it on without a break. Self-consciousness itself is ambivalent about its predicament,
    corresponding to the ambiguity of ‘taking (one’s) life’: cf. ¶361.
---
      

¶365. 1. Consciousness has passed abruptly from staunch individualism to subjection to blind
   fate. In fact this is the result of its own essence and doing. But there is no mediating link,
   available to consciousness itself, between the two factors, nothing to combine them both
   and explain their connection.
¶366. 1. Self-consciousness accepts this alien necessity as its own essence. It thereby removes
   the sting from it and survives as a new shape of consciousness.
b. The law of the heart and the frenzy of self-conceit
¶368. 1. The law of the heart represents the sentimental romanticism associated with Rousseau
   and Goethe’s Werther. However, Hyppolite I, p.303, suggests that Hegel’s model was Karl
   Moor, the hero of Schiller’s play, The Robbers. Cheated of his inheritance by his brother,
   Karl forms a band of brigands to right the wrongs of feudal corruption. He despises the
   conventions of organized society and represents the primitive power of nature. He is a
   criminal, but (like Robin Hood) a criminal inspired by high ideals and a law of his own.
¶369. 1. The unsatisfactory world confronting the heart stems from the fate or necessity that
   confronted the pleasure-seeker. But as a new shape, unconscious of its origin, the heart
   simply finds this positive world confronting its own negativity, unaware that it is a necessary
   accompaniment of itself.
¶370. 1. The aim of the heart is the same as that of Faust, to gain pleasure by uniting with the
   world. But the heart derives its pleasure from promoting the pleasure of all. It sees its own
   pleasure and universal pleasure as inseparable. It sees the law of its own heart as the
   necessary law of the world. What it needs is discipline, mediating between itself and
   necessity, between the law of the heart and the law of the world.
¶371. 1. The world goes its own way, governed by its own law, and most people just put up
   with it. But they should be jolted from their deference to human and even divine authority.
   (Karl Moor protests against divine as well as human authority.) The law of the world is just a
   sham. It may on occasion agree with the law of the heart. But what matters is that the law
   should satisfy the heart, not such coincidental agreement with the heart.
¶372. 1. If the individual actualizes the law of his heart, he faces a dilemma. On the one hand,
   the new universal order ceases to be the law of his own heart. He has thereby shed his
   singularity and acquired a part, however small, in what is now an objective universal order
   independent of himself. On the other hand, he cannot simply reject the new order, since it is
   what he wanted and results from his own doing.
¶373. 1. The heart is both singular and universal. It is singular in that it wants its own law
   to be actualized, and actualized by itself, not by anyone else. It is universal in that it aims at
   the pleasure of everyone. But in consistency, it should universalize the nature of its own
   project and say that everyone has a right to fulfil the law of their own heart or, at least, that
   every heart should recognize itself in the established order. But other hearts may differ
   from mine. They may not             find satisfaction in the new order I have established. Even if they
   want the same order as I do, they want to set it up themselves, not simply accept what I have
   done. So I am now in conflict not only with the law of the world, but with other hearts on a par
   with my own.
¶374. 1. Owing to its exclusive focus on itself, the heart misconceives the nature of a society
   and the way in which it operates. A society is not like a block of marble to be chiselled by an
   individual at will. It is a universal that engulfs the singular individual, alienating him from
   himself and transforming him into an integrated part of itself. He is just one of the many
   individuals who animate society and have as much consciousness and heart as he does. He
   hardly recognizes his former Self when he sees himself integrated into this universal order.
¶375. 1. Consciousness has two perspectives on itself. In the first, it is an idealistic reformer,
   above and outside the society it aspires to create. In the second, it occupies a role within this
---
                                                                                                          

    society, as only one of many individuals on a par with itself. It is divided in its allegiance
    between these contradictory visions of itself.
¶376. 1. Self-consciousness is now deranged, internally torn between two conflicting visions of
    itself. Derangement is not just ordinary madness. If I believe that pigs have wings or that the
    world is coming to an end tomorrow, then I am mad, because of the conflict between my
    beliefs and the beliefs of most others. I may feel some discomfort at my isolation, since for
    most of my beliefs I depend on the agreement of others. But since I am not in any other
    respect torn internally, and not with regard to my very essence, I am only mad, not
    deranged. ‘Derangement’ is Verrücktheit, from the verb verrücken, ‘to displace, (re)move,
    dislocate’. For more on the varieties of madness, see                  Enc. III, ¶408 Addition.
¶377. 1. Consciousness displaces its own perversion and projects it onto priests and despots:
    cf. ¶¶542 and 550. But this does not solve its problem. The law of the heart, and the heart
    itself, is what matters, but rather than merely ‘opined’                 or meant ( gemeintes), it ought to be
    actualized. Then this actuality is what really matters. But the heart can accept no universal
    order as an adequate actualization of itself and its law. It thus comes to see that it itself is
    perverted and perverting, though with less success than priests and despots.
¶378. 1. Since individuals are generally perverse and perverting, this universal order is also
    perverted. It is, however, ambivalent. It is, on the one hand, the law of all hearts. Despite
    their complaints, individuals cling to it and resist radical changes. They fear the threat of
    anarchy that Karl Moor presents, and decline to follow him to a life of crime in the forest.
    On the other hand, it is perverted, as ¶379 will show.
¶379. 1. The moral individualism of the heart is not confined to one heart. It has now spread
    to society as a whole, and each individual has his own view about how society should be.
    Society is therefore a relatively stable equilibrium maintained by the reciprocal resistance of
    competing interests counterbalancing each other.
¶380. 1. In ¶379, the actuality of society consisted in the competing, and alternating, actual-
    ities of diverse hearts. In ¶378 it was an ideal tranquil order, but not one that could be
    actualized without sublating self-assertive individuality. Consciousness now sets out to
    actualize this second ideal and it begins by sacrificing its own noxious singularity and
    devoting itself to what is really true and good. Hyppolite, I, p.311, compares Don Quixote,
    the knight of virtue: cf. ¶386.
c. Virtue and the course of the world
¶381. 1. Each subsection of section B involves two sides and also a contrast between indi-
    viduality and universality. In ‘Pleasure and necessity’, each side instantiated only one of
    these moments . In        ‘The law of the heart’, each side involved both, but as unity on one side,
    and in opposition on the other. This new shape of consciousness also has two sides, virtue
    and the course of the world, and each involves the moments both in unity and in opposition.
    For virtue, universal law is what matters; individuality must be sublated on both sides.
    Virtuous consciousness must subjugate its own individuality to the universal, but it retains a
    residue of personal consciousness (since the good is its                  good), which can be removed only
    by sacrificing its whole personality, thereby eradicating individuality in the course of the
    world too: see ¶¶383ff. In the course of the world, conversely, individuality is the essence
    and universality subordinate. For virtue, however, this universal is not perverted by
    individuality (as it was for the heart). It is the unactualized essence of the course of the
    world and will emerge when individuality is sublated, without requiring virtue to have
    enough individuality to         produce it.
¶382. 1. The course of the world has two aspects, deriving from pleasure and necessity, and
    from the law of the heart, respectively. First, there is singular individuality, seeking its own
    pleasure. Many individuals acting self-interestedly constitute a stable universal order, as in
---
      

    ¶¶351 and 379, but in a perverted way, since singular pleasure is the essence, and the
    universal only its contingent outcome. Secondly, there is individuality that aspires to be the
    law in its own right. It thereby disturbs the universal law that is contingent on selfish
    interests, but does not subvert it, since it does not regard it as simply raw material for its
    own designs, but as the type of order that virtue itself hopes for, only as the result of virtue
    rather than of pleasure and perversion. When virtue becomes conscious of its ambivalent
    attitude, it is derangement. Otherwise it sees only perversion.
¶383. 1. If virtue succeeds in actualizing the in-itself of the course of the world, it will not enjoy
    the fruits of its success, since it will have eradicated all individuality, including its own. It
    must be an individual in its            doing, but once it succeeds there will be no self-conscious
    individual to do or enjoy anything. The conflict is a battle of ideas; the combatants bear no
    other weapons than their own essence.
¶384. 1. Virtue has a conception of the good, as yet unactualized, that it aims to actualize in
    the world. In the world it discerns an inner disposition to actualize the good. There is no
    point or substance to this conception of the good, except insofar as it is for an other, that is,
    essentially dependent on the world in which it is to be actualized. The conception of the
    good is not only abstract in being as yet unactualized, but also in being thin and unsub-
    stantial except insofar as it derives its content from the actual course of the world. Virtue
    wants the world to be good, but it only knows what this amounts to from the dispositions
    already inherent in the world.
¶385. 1. The weapons that virtue wields are gifts (such as courage, energy, intelligence). They
    need to be used by individuals to have any effect, and may be used either rightly or wrongly.
    The same weapons are wielded by the way of the world, in virtue of its inner potentiality.
¶386. 1. Virtue’s combat against the world is a sham-fight, for various reasons: its belief that
    the world essentially involves the good, which will therefore actualize itself, means that it
    cannot take its own activity seriously. If it were to                   fight seriously, it would damage the
    world’s gifts, and also its own; these gifts are an intrinsic part of the good. In the conflict
    itself the world shows its mettle and displays its gifts in action; whenever virtue finds a weak
    spot in the world, the world’s reaction displays its goodness. Virtue is pushing at an open
    door or tilting at windmills.
¶387. 1. Virtue is hamstrung by its own commitments, to goodness as the in-itself and to the
    suppression of individuality. The course of the world, by contrast, has no such sacrosanct
    commitments. Its essence is individuality, the power that wields the weapons that it shares
    with virtue. The good and its moments are at its disposal, to be respected or overridden as it
    pleases.
¶388. 1. Virtue cannot outsmart the world by exploiting its potential goodness. The world is
    not blinkered, as virtue is. It has already encountered goodness in the conflict. To the extent
    that it has not encountered it, it is entirely dormant and can be activated only by the gifts
    and capacities of individuals.
¶389. 1. Virtue’s project is incoherent, sustained only by empty distinctions. It distinguishes
    between actuality and individuality, aiming to actualize the good, while sacrificing indi-
    viduality, when individuality is the lifeblood of actuality; and between the good in-itself and
    Being, when the in-itself is nothing unless it is actualized as Being. It is individuality that
    enables the course of the world to             ‘pervert’, or invert, a static ideal into a living reality.
¶390. 1. This modern virtue, associated with the romantics and with Kant’s and Fichte’s
    morality of     ‘Ought’, is quite different from the virtue of the ancient Greeks and Romans.
    Ancient virtue was rooted in the whole people and their ethical life, deriving a substantial
    content from them. It did not aim to change society, but to maintain it as an ongoing
    system. Modern virtue is, by contrast, an empty cry of anguish against the wicked world,
    from those who purport to stand outside the social order and demand its radical overhaul.

¶391. 1.    ‘Perversion’ and ‘conversion’           both translate Verkehrung.
¶392. 1. An untranslatable pun on the similarity of                      Ansich (‘in-itself ’) and Ansicht (‘view,
    point of view’), an approximate synonym of Meinung,                       ‘opinion’.
        2. Hegel seems to affirm two logically independent propositions: (1) ‘When someone
    acts in a social context, he does not promote only his own interest’; and (2) ‘When someone
    acts in a social context, he is not motivated only by his own interest’.
¶393. 1. The       final unification of the in-itself and individuality or Being-for-itself leads to
    section C.
C .  INDIVIDUALITY WHICH TAKES ITSELF TO BE REAL IN AND FOR ITSELF
¶394. 1. Self-consciousness has now regained the certainty of being all reality (in one sense of
    this  fluid expression: cf. ¶¶150 and 230ff.), a certainty that it had lost in ¶347. It now
    combines the universal, the gifts and capacities, with individuality, their driving force. The
    rift that opened up in section B between its purpose and actuality is now closed, and reason
    (which was temporarily replaced by heart, imagination, and rhetoric) is aware of the
    category, the unity of self-consciousness and Being. In section A too, where reason                              first
    appeared, self-consciousness was conceived as Being-for-itself, whose mission was to negate
    the actuality confronting it in order to actualize its own purpose. Now the purpose, or
    Being-for-itself, and Being-in-itself, or actuality, have coalesced, since the purpose is no
    longer a private matter but is on show for others and therefore integrated in actuality. There
    is now no gulf between certainty and truth. Previously, the purpose was the certainty and its
    actualization, or its failure to actualize itself, the truth. But now that the two sides have
    coalesced, we can equally say that the purpose is the truth and its actualization the certainty.
¶395. 1. Observing reason (A) and active reason (B) each focused on one aspect of the
    category, respectively Being and self-consciousness, or the in-itself and the for-itself. Now
    self-consciousness is aware of the category in both aspects. Or, since it is itself one aspect of
    the category, it is the category conscious of itself. It has forgotten these previous shapes of
    consciousness, but they resurface within it, as distinct moments of its own development. But
    it sticks to the unity of Being and the Self through thick and thin.
¶396. 1. Consciousness is now wholly self-contained. Its activity is not opposed to anything
    else and does not depend on anything else. Its activity has no other material or purpose than
    itself. The environing element in which it acts is simply the daylight in which it displays
    itself and its activity for what it is. Its activity thus has two forms: as in itself, it is the thought
    that unifies it, while as actual it is a unitary being exposed to the daylight. The content of the
    activity is just its simple Self; it is not in transit to anywhere else.
a. The spiritual animal kingdom and deceit, or the Thing itself
¶397. 1. The animals are intellectuals—scholars, professors, and artists, each of whom attri-
    butes an overriding importance to his own work. Each of them is enclosed in his own
    specialized activity. The cause or ‘Thing’ (Sache) that they purport to serve is an empty
    abstraction. Later it will become spirit, when the relationship between consciousnesses is
    reciprocal.
¶398. 1. Before it becomes active, individuality is just in itself and as such has an original
    determinate nature. Since all determination is negation, this nature involves negation,
    though not the sort of negation that one entity exerts on another and that generates
    movement. It has a quality and a determinate range, within which it has to operate, (as,
    e.g., a tadpole can only become a frog, even if it is not hampered by anything external). This
    limits the Being of consciousness, but not its doing, since it is not related to anything else
    that could impose a limit on it. Analogously, indeterminate animal life vivifies a particular
    elemental environment, which imposes a limitation on what species it can form. Neverthe-
    less, it maintains its unity in these elements and remains one universal animal-life amid the
---
     

   diversity of animals. (Indeterminate animal-life corresponds to individuality in general.
   Diverse animal species correspond to different human individuals, which differ from each
   other more than the members of an animal species do. The different ‘elements’ correspond
   to the worlds of art, science, literature, philosophy, etc.)
¶399. 1. An individual has a determinate talent, e.g. for writing philosophy books or repairing
   boilers. (So far Hegel gives no reason for restricting his claims to professors and artists.)
   This talent determines the individual’s purpose, which is thus limited in its content. But it
   only looks like this when we consider it in isolation and before consciousness begins to act.
   In fact, the purpose has a universal significance: it is reality or actuality as it meshes with
   that singular consciousness. When it gets to work, consciousness does not feel its deter-
   minacy as a limit to be overcome. Its purpose                  fits its immediate environment like a glove.
   There are two types of negativity, one constituting determinacy and another involved in all
   activity: cf. ¶398. In his activity the individual merges with the whole system of negating
   determinacies. He discovers universality in his limited task.
¶400. 1. There are three terms in the syllogistic triad of doing: the original purpose, the means
   of its execution, and the actualized purpose. These terms also figure in consciousness’s
   reflection on its activity. These distinctions should be purely formal, with no difference in
   their content, no loss of content as we pass from one to the next. This identity of content
   extends also to the distinctions between individuality and Being in general, between the
   individual’s purpose and his original nature, and between the means employed and ‘actual-
   ity as absolute purpose’, i.e. the means must not undermine the environment in which the
   individual’s purpose is to be actualized.
¶401. 1. The individual must abide by its original nature, its capacities, etc. But this original
   nature is not only a stick urging him to fulfil his purpose in actuality. It is also a carrot in
   actuality itself, luring him on to activity: he views the actuality facing him not in a neutral
   way, but as requiring a certain contribution from himself. So his activity only draws out
   what is already implicit in Being, though not                    ‘presented’. Actuality itself prescribes the
   course he must follow.—The individual can only know what he is in himself, and therefore
   what his purpose is, by actualizing himself. But conversely, he must know his purpose
   beforehand in order to act. He escapes from this circle by acting immediately, without
   dividing his doing into a beginning, means (or middle), and end. His original nature is all
   three at once. It is the beginning: the circumstances of the action, permeated by his interest,
   that tells him what to do. It is the middle: as talent, which is a sort of means, it tells him how
   to do it. His interest together with his talent gives him all he needs to go into action, which
   the means then do by converting themselves from inner to outer and actualizing the
   individual. The whole action is thus a self-contained circle. Purpose, means, circumstances,
   and even the         ‘work’    (Werk) produced, as the actualization of the individual, are all
   integrated in the action.
¶402. 1. So far the individual’s performance has been self-enclosed, unrelated to those of other
   individuals. But the work emerges from this enclosure and raises the question of differences
   between individuals. A work is determinate in virtue of two types of negation, one involved
   in activity, the other congealed in the determinacy of its product: cf. ¶¶398f. Consciousness
   thus distinguishes itself as the negativity of activity, which may result in alternative
   determinacies, from the static determinacy involved in a particular work. Thus it can
   compare different works and their creators.
¶403. 1. The comparisons between works in ¶402 were only quantitative, saying e.g. that one
   work is less energetic than another and thus that its author is less energetic. It does not
   follow, however, that this work is bad and the other good. (Nor, presumably, does it follow
   that one work is better than another.) There is no standard here for assessing the goodness
   or badness of a work apart from whether it is an apt expression of its author’s original
---
                                                                                                         

    nature, and no standard for assessing the goodness and badness of original natures other
    than the works they produce. Since a work inevitably expresses its author’s original nature
    exactly, any work is good or, rather, neither good nor bad; it cannot be appropriately
    compared with the works of others in respect of its merit. (This claim is more applicable to,
    say, poetry than to boiler repairs.)
¶404. 1. Neither the author of a work nor others should assess it either favourably or
    unfavourably, since the work inevitably matches the author’s nature and activity. This
    does involve a comparison between the in-itself and the work, but since these are made to
    measure the result of the comparison is a foregone conclusion. The author should say, like
    Shakespeare’s Touchstone, that his work is ‘an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own’. We
    might also compare Browning’s               Andrea del Sarto, e.g.:         ‘I, painting from myself and to
    myself,/Know what I do, am unmoved by men’s blame/Or their praise either. . . . /Speak as
    they please, what does the mountain care?’
¶405. 1. Can consciousness’s conception of itself in ¶404 be sustained in the face of reality?
    The individual has put his heart and soul into the work, and now he is exposed, in his work,
    to the critical gaze not only of his own particular consciousness, but of the universal
    consciousness. In fact he himself has become universal consciousness by focusing on the
    negativity of doing rather than the determinacy of his work (cf. ¶402) and ventures out into
    the public space to survey his work with a disinterested eye. It is not enough for him to
    savour his work in private. He needs to see how it fares in the open space of Being. When the
    work enters this space, everything that went into its creation is left behind and only the
    determinate original nature, embodied in the determinate work, enters into competition
    with other determinate natures and gets lost in the melee. Within the individual’s enclosure,
    his original nature counts as universal, able to do whatever it likes, but in the work its non-
    universal determinacy is exposed to daylight and dissolves. That is, this work in which the
    individual actualized himself is not only determinate in content, it has also detached
    itself from its author and become alien. Other individuals                       find it alien too. They want
    to replace it with their own actuality. Their interest in it is different from that inscribed
    in it by its author, and they interpret it quite differently. The work gets lost, along with
    its author.
¶406. 1. In the shapes of consciousness of section B (pleasure and necessity, etc.) self-
    consciousness (doing) began in opposition to actuality (Being). Here in C it began in
    unity with actuality, but ends up opposed to it. There are three terms in play: the original
    nature, the doing, and the work. The original nature and the work are both Being, in
    contrast to the doing. The doing is at odds with the determinacy of the original nature and
    especially of the work. Doing, as movement and becoming, is never satisfied with its fixation
    in a determinate work and always feels that it could have produced, and could go on to
    produce, something different. The disparity is between the concept and reality. It doesn’t
    matter whether we regard Being (qua original nature) as the concept, with doing as the
    reality, or Being (qua original nature and work) as the reality, with doing as the concept. In
    either case their disparity gives a negative answer to the question raised in ¶405: conscious-
    ness’s conception of itself in ¶404 cannot be sustained in the face of reality.
¶407. 1. The individual’s doing was the concept that held together all the factors involved. But
    now that the work has emerged into public space, they come apart. The author need not
    have expressed his original nature in any aim or purpose at all, or might have expressed it
    differently. He could have chosen different means to express his purpose. And whether
    these factors hang together or not, the public reception of the work depends on luck, not on
    the intrinsic merit of the purpose or its execution.
¶408. 1. Consciousness need not accept wholeheartedly the disintegration of its performance
    in ¶407. It can insist on the unity and necessity of its doing. It did at least perform an action,
---
      

   expressing its purpose in actuality and, from its own point of view, its performance was
   coherently unified. What does it matter if its work vanishes in the public sphere? The very
   fact of its vanishing shows that the actual work does not matter and nor, therefore, does its
   vanishing. The vanishing is just as contingent and irrelevant as, in ¶407, its own doing was
   supposed to be.
¶409. 1. The individual has in effect produced two works. One of them disintegrates in
   objective actuality, in the public space. The other is the work he intended to produce,
   which remains as enduring as ever, unaffected by its public fate. The disintegration of the
   first work in actuality affects not only the work it demolishes, but actuality itself. If actuality
   cannot do justice to his intended work, then so much the worse for actuality. It is now only
   one factor in the individual’s consideration, and not a very important one. What really
   matters,    ‘the Thing itself ’ (die Sache selbst), is the ideal work he intended, not the disinte-
   grating work and the actuality in which it disintegrates, which is only the                         ‘Thing’ (Sache),
   not   ‘the Thing itself ’. Sache       is here used in two senses:          first, it is what really matters, and
   secondly it approximates to           Ding, the ‘thing’      of perception: cf. ¶410.
¶410. 1. The work as it disintegrates in actuality is just a ‘thing’ (Ding), a small fragment of
   reality with no special significance. The work as the individual now views it is, by contrast, a
   ‘Thing’, a thing to which self-consciousness attributes spiritual significance. All the factors
   involved in the work—individuality, actuality, doing, purpose, and the transition into
   actuality—are united in the Thing. It is an actual object, but an object in which self-
   consciousness invests its identity. It is, however, a somewhat abstract entity and will be
   subject to the dialectic of sensory certainty and perception.
¶411. 1. The       Thing      itself,  in   combining        individuality      with     objectivity,     presents     self-
   consciousness with its substance. But it is only an inchoate form of spiritual substance
   and so not an adequate model of self-consciousness. The Thing itself runs through the
   factors involved in it as a predicate, as the genus of their species, and is only an abstract
   universal, loosely holding them together. It is not the subject, since it does not constitute or
   generate these factors. Cf. ¶641, where, in a summary of this episode, the Thing itself is said
   to have been a predicate, whereas conscience is a subject.
¶412. 1. Hegel is influenced by French moralists, whose concept of honnêteté wavers between
   probity and good manners. Honnêteté requires consciousness to be able to respond appro-
   priately to any situation, as well as to deal with the Thing that matters. Consciousness can
   do this applying the predicate           ‘Thing itself ’    to each moment of its performance in turn.
¶413. 1. Whatever happens, honnêteté interprets so as to show consciousness in a good light.
   It can apply the predicate ‘Thing itself ’ to the work or its absence, to its success or its failure,
   even to its interest in events in which it played no part.
¶414. 1. In order to get its satisfaction, as well as to remain honest, consciousness must avoid
   bringing together its various uses of the Thing itself. Otherwise it would see that it is just an
   abstraction, only the thought           of a unity of willing and achieving.
¶415. 1. This supposed honesty must see that the moments it separates are intrinsically related
   to each other. Any one that the individual aligns himself with brings the others in its train.
   Each of these moments is linked with the individual and so can be regarded either as the
   Thing in its own right, independently of the individual’s role in it, or as his                      Thing. Thus he
   wavers between concern about the Thing as such and concern about himself. He purports to
   be concerned only about the Thing as such, when really he is concerned about his own
   doing or his own work; or vice versa. Both are needed in fact. Nothing would get done if no
   one cared about his own performance, but conversely the performance is pointless unless
   there is a Thing to be realized that has independent value.
¶416. 1. In ¶¶412–15, consciousness switched its allegiance from one moment of its perform-
   ance to another for its own benefit, and so the Thing itself kept changing its content. Now
---
                                                                                             

    Hegel brings in others and turns to the play of individualities. So the various moments of the
    Thing itself differ in their form as well. The individual presents one of these moments to
    others, but keeps back its opposite for himself. But he also alternates between them, now
    keeping back the         first moment for himself, and presenting the second to others. His
    allegiance is to the Thing itself, but as an abstraction this can only be exhausted by running
    through all the moments it embraces. (One might think here of Don Juan, whose allegiance
    to womanhood can only be exhausted by successive seductions. He declares his love to each
    woman in turn while always harbouring a passion for another. But cf. ¶417.)
¶417. 1. Here Hegel has intellectuals, philosophers, etc. in mind. The individual purports,
    when he writes a book, to be concerned only with the Thing as such. But he wants to write
    it himself, not have it done by others. The others pretend that their offer of help was
    motivated only by concern for the Thing as such, but they too are concerned with their
    own doing. The same is true of book reviewers. They are concerned not with the Thing as
    such, but with their own generosity or their critical acumen and with the public display of
    it. On the other hand, the submission of a work and of assessments of it to the public
    realm implies that they are not solely concerned with their own private doings but want
    their own products to become available to others. To withstand this exposure they must
    have some intrinsic merit, apart from the egocentricity of their authors. The individual is
    thus mercurial and elusive.
¶418. 1. The result of the self-interested doings of these reciprocally deceiving individuals is
    similar to the universal social order created by self-interested individuals in ¶315. It is the
    creation of an objective, impersonal cultural order that depends on the self-interested
    doings of everyone and is of concern to everyone, but is not in the possession of any single
    individual. This Thing itself is no longer simply a predicate, a conglomerate of distinct
    moments. It is a substance, but also a subject, which incorporates individuals and converts
    them into a universal individual: cf. ¶17. It is therefore the category, which combines the
    individual I with objective Being: cf. ¶¶235ff. Earlier the category did this only in thought,
    but now it integrates all the disparate moments of self-consciousness.
b. Reason as lawgiver
¶419. 1. Self-consciousness is no longer a particular self-seeking individual. It has adopted
    an impersonal, disinterested stance, so that it is a universal Self common to all individ-
    uals. It is united with the Thing itself, which is therefore the category. However, the Thing
    itself is as yet only an abstraction and needs to acquire content from the doings of
    individuals.
¶420. 1. The Thing itself is now the be all and end all of consciousness. It heals all the
    oppositions that plagued consciousness earlier. Consciousness is here the consciousness
    of the ethical substance, and self-consciousness is only one moment of it, while the other is
    Being. But self-consciousness cannot transcend, and does not want to transcend, this ethical
    substance, since it is entirely at home in it. The ethical substance differentiates itself into
    ‘masses’    (Massen)—a term that occurs frequently in chapter VI for the divisions of
    substance, and here applies to different laws—but these divisions do not impair its concep-
    tual unity.
¶421. 1. The ethical substance incorporates both the pure consciousness of it and self-
    consciousness. So self-consciousness is identified with ethical substance and is therefore
    not in a position to ask for a justification of its laws or to suggest an alternative.
¶423. 1. This ethical intuitionism is comparable to the sensory certainty of ¶¶90ff., and we
    must similarly consider it and its laws immediately, without introducing any extraneous
    reflections of our own. The immediacy of ethical intuitionism requires an equally immedi-
    ate consideration of it.
---
     

¶424. 1. This law, supposedly known immediately, dies the death of a thousand qualifications.
   It ends up either as entirely contingent, universal only in form (‘Everyone ought to speak
   what he believes to be the truth’) or properly universal, but empty of content and unfulfil-
   lable (‘Everyone ought to know the truth’). The law is not immediate at all, but subject to a
   complex dialectic. As in his treatment of sensory certainty in chapter I, Hegel plays with the
   word ‘meinen’.
¶425. 1. Unlike truth-telling, this is a Judaeo-Christian commandment rather than a Kantian
   duty. Kant criticized it, since a convicted criminal could appeal to it to secure his release,
   though he did acknowledge a more modest duty of charity. Hegel had great confidence in
   the State, despite examples, in and before his own time, of broken or malevolent States, and
   might be accused of the same high-minded idealism as his opponents. But he would reply
   that if the State fails then individual charity can only be marginal and uncertain of success;
   good intentions count for nothing. Here he disparages the very idea of ‘Ought’ (das Sollen)
   more trenchantly than in ¶424. He does not mean that a law is invariably obeyed, like a law
   of nature, but that it can form part of a socially accepted code, whereas a commandment is
   just a high-minded ideal.
¶426. 1. A command has the universal form ‘Everyone ought to x’, where ‘x’ stands for some
   determinate content, such as ‘tell the truth’              or ‘love their neighbour’. But any replacement
   for ‘x’  is inadequate for the simple ethical substance. It amounts to no content at all, since
   it requires nothing definite of the individual. In its universal form                    the command expresses
   the ethical substance, but the content with which it replaces                           ‘x’  must be abandoned.
   What we are then left with is the form ‘Everyone ought to x’, and the most we can require
   of this is that it should not be contradictory, e.g. that it not be logically impossible for
   everyone to do ‘x’.
¶428. 1. Reason no longer attempts to formulate and prescribe laws itself, but confines itself to
   testing existing and proposed laws for logical consistency.
c. Reason as law-testing
¶429. 1. Earlier we, Hegel and his readers, tested the laws submitted by law-giving reason.
   Those laws proved inadequate to the ethical substance, and we were left with formal
   universality, which now becomes a powerful weapon when consciousness confronts deter-
   minate laws. For it is not we who now test laws, but consciousness itself. Its testing differs from
   ours. We measured a law against the ethical substance and found that its content dwindled away
   into contingency or vacuity. Consciousness, by contrast, ignores the ethical substance and its
   requirements. It accepts the content presented to it in a law and tests it for logical consistency
   only, leaving aside its other defects. (Hegel seems to confuse a non-contradictory law with a
   ‘tautology’, but he means that the principle of non-contradiction is a tautology.)
¶430. 1. Hegel is mistaken in supposing that because the principle of non-contradiction is
   tautologous, any and every content would be self-consistent. ‘No one ought to own an
   unpropertied slave’ is consistent, while its opposite ‘Everyone ought to own an unpropertied
   slave’  is not, since it is logically impossible for everyone, including the slaves, to own such a
   slave. But apart from such concocted examples, he is right to suppose that any and every
   content can be made self-consistent. Neither the institution of private property nor its
   absence is contradictory. When examined in detail, the absence of property reveals what
   Hegel regards as contradictions, but are really only conflicts between absence of property
   and other requirements, such as the satisfaction of needs, long-term security, and equality.
   Distribution according to needs and equal distribution are not logically incompatible, but
   are likely to be incompatible in practice.
¶431. 1. When a concept such as property or non-property is treated as a simple determinacy,
   it is not contradictory. But when it is analysed, or at least considered as it works in practice,
---
                                                                                                         

    it reveals contradictions, all stemming, in these cases, from a contradiction between
    universality and singularity, e.g. between the permanence of my property and my con-
    sumption of it, between the equality implicit in reciprocal recognition and my exclusive
    ownership, and between the universality of a thing and my possession of it.—None of these
    are in fact strict contradictions, nor do they raise practical difficulties comparable to those of
    non-property. The principle of non-contradiction is not wholly ‘indifferent to truth and
    falsehood’: a contradictory proposition is unquestionably false, while a consistent propos-
    ition may be true or false.
¶432. 1. The two moments are law-giving and law-testing. Their failure does not mean that
    the difference within ethical substance (between the masses: cf. ¶420) or knowledge of it
    must be abandoned. Substance essentially involves consciousness of itself and thus requires
    such knowledge. Taken on their own, law-giving and law-testing are unstable, but they
    indicate that ethical substance is becoming ethical consciousness.
¶433. 1. See ¶412 on honesty. A ‘supposed’                  (seinsollenden) content is more literally a content
    ‘that ought to be’ and thus remains in the realm of the Ought rather than of practical reality.
¶434. 1. Without honesty, law-giving and law-testing may lapse into immorality. Law-giving
    sets up laws that look arbitrary and tyrannical. They are only ‘laws’ (Gesetze), not ‘com-
    mands’ (Gebote), which here has the flavour of ‘commandments’, prescriptions with an aura
    of divine authority. Law-testing looks at the laws from outside and undermines their
    authority with its nit-picking criticism.
¶435. 1. Law-giving and law-testing do not get to the heart of ethical substance. In its depths
    substance is still immediate and accepted unreflectively, while on its surface it is turned into
    an individual’s willing, etc. But now law-giving and law-testing become merely moments of
    the Self of consciousness, which combines with the spiritual essence. That is, we are no
    longer concerned with the individual consciousness, but with spirit, the collective con-
    sciousness or mentality of the whole community, as will emerge in ¶438.
¶436. 1.     ‘First of all’ (vors erste), i.e. in the Greek city-state (see ¶¶ 444ff.), the spiritual essence
    is simply accepted as given and is subject to no testing. Individuals have entirely absorbed
    the norms of their society and accept them without question. The individual has become a
    universal I, united with the world as the category prefigured: cf. ¶235. His acceptance of the
    norms is a childlike acceptance, not sophisticated belief or ‘faith’ (Glaube), which is a stance
    of a single individual towards something that seems alien and requires the overcoming of
    doubts. The individual is now entirely at one with the ethical substance and no doubts or
    reservations have yet arisen.
¶437. 1. Sophocles’s Antigone, lines 456f.
        2. The difference between self-consciousness and the essence is ‘transparent’ in the sense
    that there is no opaque barrier between them. The articulation of the essence into different
    masses (see ¶420), between e.g. the law of the family and the law of the State in Greece, is no
    longer the work of individuals, but of the essence itself. If self-consciousness’s relationship to
    the law is a variety of ethical intuitionism, it is quite different from the ethical intuitionism of
    law-giving in ¶423. The law-giver was an individual who stepped back from his society and
    asked ‘What laws should there be?’ and ‘Why should they be of one sort rather than another?’
    Now the ethical individual is so integrated in his society that he cannot even ask such
    questions. Even if he were to ask them, there is no answer to be given in the terms of law-
    giving and law-testing. To steal the property that someone has deposited with me is wrong
    just because it is wrong. No contradiction is involved in stealing it. It may be contradictory to
    say that it is permissible for me to take someone else’s                    property, but I can avoid that by
    redesignating it as my         own property. There is no contradiction in this redesignation. It is,
    after all, just what I do if I give someone a gift: it is now his property, not mine. But this is just
    a passing shot at Kant. Self-consciousness is no longer in a position to raise such questions.

(BB.) Spirit
VI. Spirit
¶438. 1. In PS, spirit is primarily the collective spirit of a people. It is the truth of reason in that
   it fulfils what was initially only reason’s subjective certainty                 of being all reality. Hegel then
   summarizes the stages by which this truth was reached. Observing reason (¶¶240–346)
   hoped to find the unity of itself and reality, the category, in the realm of objective Being, but
   found itself only as a dead skull. In ¶¶347–93 reason abandons the ambition of finding itself
   and adopts a more creative approach. The Self attempts to make its mark actively on the
   alien world. This fails too, as do all one-sided approaches. So in ¶¶394–437 it tries to enter
   into a fruitful partnership with the world, creating works, proposing laws, and testing laws.
   It is, however, still distinct from the world, surveying it from outside and skimming its
   surface rather than penetrating its depths. On the other side, the world is left without a
   consciousness of itself. Now this rift is finally closed: the Self and the world merge together.
¶439. 1. Spirit has been called ‘ethical substance’                since ¶420, but that was before it was fully
   actualized by merging with the Self. As ethical substance, spirit contrasts with individuals
   and is far greater than they are. As ethical actuality, it has absorbed individuals and they are
   entirely at home in it. As substance, it is the permanent framework in which all their activity
   takes place. But insofar as it also involves the Being-for-self of individuals, it lets them take
   bits off it for their sustenance. Conversely, it is sustained by the activities of individuals. It is
   the movement and activity of self-consciousness that keeps the substance alive. Cf. ¶17 on
   substance and subject.
¶440. 1. Spirit differs in status from all the previous shapes of consciousness. Spirit is not
   simply one fleeting shape among others. It is never sublated, and it has been at work all
   along in various guises, seeking to actualize itself, as the title of PS indicates. The isolation
   and analyses of the previous shapes were conducted by spirit, focusing on particular
   aspects of itself in order to discover and develop its true nature. These aspects are only
   abstractions from spirit, whereas spirit itself is ‘existence’, a word that has the                         flavour of
   ‘stepping-forth’, in accordance with its Latin etymology. This may be why (as Hyppolite,
   II, p.16, n.6 suggests) the dialectical development of spirit corresponds to a coherent
   temporal and historical development, which is, in the preceding shapes, dimly discernible
   in the development of self-consciousness, but not elsewhere. Moreover, while each of the
   previous shapes left its predecessors behind, spirit incorporates these shapes as aspects of
   itself. It is an objective being, as the objects of consciousness are. It is Being-for-itself, as
   self-consciousness is. It is the unity of both, an object which reason determines in
   accordance with the category. But at that stage spirit did not see that reason is more
   than an onlooker and is actualized in spirit itself. Now it does, and so does not only have
   reason, but is      reason.
¶441. 1. Spirit proceeds through various shapes that are themselves spirits, the Greek
   spirit, the spirit of the Roman Empire, etc. Only the                      first of these, the Greek spirit, is
   genuine ethical life. Spirit must become conscious of this immediate ethical life, thereby
   undermining it. Passing in this way from shape to shape, spirit advances to self-
   knowledge. These shapes are shapes of a world, located in time and space. The previous
   shapes, even if they presupposed a background culture, were primarily shapes of individ-
   ual consciousness.
¶442. 1. Hegel summarizes the whole development of spirit. It begins with the tightly knit
   ethical life of the Greek city-state. This is rent apart by its self-knowledge, leading to the
   abstract ‘right’     of the Roman Empire, which sets the Self in opposition to the substance.
   Division persists in the history of Europe down to the French revolution: there are two
   realms, that of culture (the hither side) and that of faith (the beyond). These realms are

                                                                                                       

    shattered by the      ‘insight’ of the enlightenment, the conceptual penetration of an object that
    results in its dissolution. The two realms thus coalesce into morality, where the Self is all-
    important, culminating in conscience.
¶443. 1. Spirit follows the Hegelian pattern of immediate unity-division-restoration of unity
    on a higher level. The actual self-consciousness of absolute spirit is religion, the subject of
    chapter VII, while chapter VI presents the consciousness of absolute spirit: see Jarczyk and
    Labarrière I, pp.749f., n.12.

A .  THE TRUE SPIRIT , THE ETHICAL ORDER
¶444. 1. This is an abstract account of what will be explained more concretely in ¶445. Action
    breaks up the simple unity of the ethical world. Since the agent must be conscious of the
    ethical substance in whose interests he is acting, he opens up a gap between substance and
    the consciousness of it. He also opens a gap within substance and within consciousness,
    because in acting he must opt for one aspect of substance rather than another. Thus
    substance contrasts with the singular action. Self-consciousness is the all-embracing middle
    term between substance and the agent. Implicitly the agent is unified with the substance.
    Now he becomes so explicitly, by acting ethically, but he thereby reduces substance to his
    action, which actualizes only one aspect of substance at the expense of others.
¶445. 1. Consciousness has a tendency to introduce division. Hence, as well as the existing
    opposition between substance and self-conscious individuals, it also splits substance into
    two ‘masses’ (cf. ¶420), the human law of the State and the divine law of the family. The self-
    conscious individual devotes him- or herself to one of these laws and neglects the other. This
    introduces a new division, between what the individual knows and what s/he does not
    know, when s/he acts. These conflicts destroy the individual agents and the ethical order
    itself, but give rise to a fully self-conscious individual, detached from social norms. On the
    contrast between knowing and not knowing, see also ¶¶467, 469.
a. The ethical world. Human and divine law: man and woman
¶446. 1. Structural patterns recur at different levels. In ¶¶110ff., the certainty of simple Being
    passed into perception of a thing with many properties, but these reduced to the contrast of
    singularity and universality. Analogously, ethical perception finds many relations, such as
    society/individual, man/woman, State/family, life/death, but these reduce to the two laws of
    singularity and universality. In the case of ethical perception, however, ‘singularity’ and
    ‘universality’    do not adequately express the two sides. Each side is championed by an
    individual     who appeals to a          universal     law, respectively human and divine, and each
    individual equates their chosen law with spirit as a whole.
¶447. 1.    ‘Commonwealth’ translates ‘Gemeinwesen’, which ordinarily means ‘community’, but
    is literally ‘common essence’, i.e. the essence of all individuals. ‘Configuration’ translates
    ‘Gestaltung’, literally      ‘shaping’, but in PS the word denotes not a particular                  ‘shape’    of
    consciousness, but a whole section containing several related shapes. Here it refers to the
    beginning of section B of chapter V, especially ¶¶350f., where the commonwealth was only
    an object for us, whereas now it is an object for itself, i.e. for the consciousness of its own
    citizens. ‘Counterglow’ translates ‘Gegenschein’, both words now applied to the faint glow in
    the night sky opposite the setting sun, owing to the reflection of sunlight by dust in space.
    Hegel is probably not alluding to this phenomenon, but the idea is similar, that the
    commonwealth is reflected in individuals. The commonwealth as a unitary people is a
    real entity, comparable to the English language reflected in its speakers.
¶448. 1. What ¶447 described is the human law, embracing the people, citizens, and government.
    It is known to and accepted by everyone, and sets them free in the public space it opens up.

¶449. 1. The State-power emerges from its opposite, the family governed by divine law. It sets
    limits to the individual Being-for-self (viz. independence) of the family, but is nevertheless
    rooted in it.
¶450. 1. Both laws involve the whole of ethical substance, only in a different form: cf. ¶446.
    Thus, although the divine law is only the inner concept or germ of the developed ethical
    order, it still involves self-consciousness, and a natural commonwealth, with interpersonal
    relations of its own, in contrast to that of the people. The gods of the household (Penates)
    stand opposed to the public order.
¶451. 1. Since the family is an aspect of the ethical substance, it must have a universal ethical
    significance over and above the natural relationship of its members. By a series of elimin-
    ations Hegel locates its ethical significance in a cult of the dead. It cannot lie in love between
    particular members, since this is not universal. So it must lie in a relation of the individual to
    the whole family. This relation cannot consist in the individual’s acquiring power and
    wealth, since, although this helps the family, its primary significance lies in his departure
    from the family and his indirect contribution, as a citizen, to the commonwealth. Equally, it
    cannot consist in some service that the whole family performs for the living individual, since
    either the need for it and its actual performance is entirely contingent (such as help in need)
    or, like education, only prepares him for his exit from the family. The concern of the family
    is not the contingent individual nor the prospective citizen, but the deceased individual.
    With burial rites it makes his death a spiritual event rather than a merely natural event.
¶452. 1. Burial rites have the aim of giving a spiritual significance to death, making it a
    conscious deed rather than a merely natural event.
¶453. 1. The       ‘elemental individual’         is the earth, as a metaphor for the family. When the
    individual breaks loose from the family to become a leading citizen, the earth-family
    draws him back into the abstraction of death. He still has power, as we shall see.
¶454. 1. The differences and gradations of human law are dealt with in ¶455, those of divine
    law in ¶456.
¶455. 1. The commonwealth is concentrated in the government, which is the Self of the whole
    ethical substance, including families. But it expands outwards into other systems, all based
    on the family, such as personal freedom, property, and economic activity, while keeping
    them under its sway. When these systems become too isolated and absorbed in their own
    business, the government engages in warfare, which shakes up the institutions, puts the fear
    of death into individuals, and restores their allegiance to the whole. This stops their ethical
    Being-there from descending into natural Being-there, viz. the family. So death, the special
    preserve of divine law, is a powerful instrument in the hands of human law. (This view of
    warfare was held by Hegel throughout his career, and has little to do with the Greek city-
    state in particular.)
¶456. 1. The marital and parental relationships are unsatisfactory ethical relationships, since
    they are governed by emotion and piety, natural rather than ethical attitudes. See also PR
    ¶¶173ff.
¶457. 1. The brother–sister relationship is not confined to the transition from one gener-
    ation to the next (like the parental relationship) nor are the parties unequal (as in the
    marital and parental relationships). Their natural ties are looser: neither produced the
    other and they do not desire each other. Antigone’s claim that while a dead husband or a
    dead child is replaceable, a dead brother is not (Sophocles,                           Antigone, lines 904–20)
    explains why Hegel says that a wife is not concerned with a particular husband or
    children, but only with a husband and children in general. Her role in the household
    thus has universal ethical significance, while her husband acquires universal significance
    as a citizen, and        finds in the family only the singularity of desire. The brother–sister
    relationship is not unequal in this way.

¶459. 1. Hegel refers back to ¶¶394ff., the beginning of chapter V, section C, where the individual
    depended on its original determinate nature, its predispositions and capacities, but without any
    sexual differentiation. Here the determinate nature involves sexual differentiation, but this is
    transcended to become the ethical difference between the human law, represented by the
    brother, and the divine law, represented by the sister, who may incidentally also be a wife.
¶460. 1. Human and divine law depend on each other. Neither the commonwealth nor the
    family could survive without the other. Ultimately the authority of human law derives from
    and is buttressed by divine law, and the citizens of human law return to it in death. However,
    divine law makes its power felt in worldly life, when it finds an agent to champion it.
¶461. 1. The ethical life of the Greek city-state fulfils all the aspirations of the preceding shapes
    of consciousness, mainly those of sections B and C of chapter V, with none of their
    disadvantages.
¶462. 1. The ethical world is a stable equilibrium in which each part is satisfied. When its
    order is disturbed—as it inevitably will be, since it is a living, not a static, system—it restores
    its equilibrium by the justice immanent in it, not an alien cosmic justice or blind revenge,
    but a rationally planned justice. There are two types of justice: human justice dispensed by
    the government, when individuals or groups become too independent (cf. ¶455), and divine
    justice dispensed by the ‘Erinys’ of the individual. Hegel is thinking of Aeschylus’s Oresteia,
    in which Orestes kills his mother, Clytemnestra, because, together with her lover, she has
    murdered his father, Agamemnon, on his return from the Trojan war; Orestes is then
    pursued by the Erinyes or Furies, avenging goddesses who punish wrongdoing, especially
    within families; eventually Orestes is acquitted by the Athenian law-court, chaired by the
    goddess Athena. Hegel assigns the Erinys (in the singular) to Orestes himself, censoring the
    ‘alien essence’ that appears in Aeschylus. The individual is never wronged by the common-
    wealth, but only by Being, which inflicts death on us all. Death is transformed from a sheer
    happening into a human achievement by the family: cf.¶¶ 451f.
¶463. 1. Hegel finds a twofold syllogistic structure in the ethical realm. One syllogism is the
    movement from the extreme of conscious spirit, by way of the middle term, man, to the
    other extreme, unconscious spirit (or death). The other is the movement from unconscious
    spirit, by way of the middle term woman, into the conscious realm. The man–woman
    relationship is the middle term linking these two syllogisms, i.e. linking divine law and
    human law. The exact form taken by this joint syllogism is unclear, mainly because it is unclear
    whether the emergence of divine law into daylight consists simply in the woman burying the
    man or in her performing (as Antigone does) a combative part in the public realm.
b. The ethical action. Human and divine knowledge. Guilt and destiny.
¶464. 1. A decisive deed will bring to a head the implicit opposition of the two laws. This will
    destroy both laws, as well as their protagonists. But a new self-conscious individualist will
    emerge from the rubble.
¶465. 1. This is not a conflict of duty and passion, or of different duties. When someone steps
    back to reflect on his duty, the notion of duty becomes so thin that it can accommodate
    almost anything, including the content of a passion: cf. ¶¶427ff. on law-testing. Conflict of
    duties is comic, because two incompatible courses of action cannot both be the binding duty
    of one and the same person: on conflict of duties, see Enc. III, ¶¶508–11. But here the duties
    are duties of different people. Each protagonist is unwaveringly certain of what s/he has to
    do, since each is inexorably bound to one of the two laws by nature, their sex. The
    protagonists are Creon, who has forbidden the burial of the defeated rebels, and Antigone,
    whose duty it is to bury her brother, Polynices. (It is not obvious that Creon has a duty               to
    forbid the burial of his enemies; he no doubt has a duty to restore order; that does not entail
    the denial of burial, though it may imply a duty to enforce obedience to his commands. If
---
     

   Antigone were less decisive, she might see her situation as a conflict between a duty to bury
   her brother and a duty to obey her ruler; but in her total commitment to divine law, she does
   not see the matter in this way.)
¶466. 1. In the ordinary ethical realm the two laws are only implicit. Their conflict emerges
   explicitly only when they are championed by two decisive self-consciousnesses. Each
   protagonist has character or backbone. S/he is not wavering between different alternatives
   or even respectful of the opponent’s case. S/he regards the opposition as sheer violence or
   obstinacy. Hence each suffers from the combination of knowledge and ignorance men-
   tioned in ¶445. (Neither Creon nor Antigone would have proposed a                             referendum to settle
   their dispute. Such blinkered obstinacy seems a more likely cause of warfare than the one
   suggested by Hegel in ¶455, which is an effect                of war rather than its cause.)
¶467. 1. Hegel primarily has in mind Creon, the champion of the right of ethical self-
   consciousness against the divine right of the essence. Since it is conscious of the substance,
   ethical self-consciousness is not opposed to actuality. It does not have a purpose of its own
   which it seeks to impose on the world, as did the shapes of consciousness considered in
   section B of chapter V. It believes that it is simply following the prescriptions of the
   substance itself, with which it completely identifies itself. It is not devious and perverting,
   like some of its forebears, and pursues its mission steadfastly without deviation. It asserts its
   right to actualize what it knows. However, its knowledge of the substance or essence is
   deficient and one-sided.
¶468. 1. The ethical essence involves two laws, but the agent aligns himself with only one,
   seemingly unaware of the other. In acting, however, he opens up a division between himself
   and the actuality that he proposes to alter. This alone incurs guilt, whether because any
   action excludes other alternatives or because one can never be sure how it will turn out:
   ‘A flung stone is the devil’s’        (PR ¶119 Addition). To make matters worse, violation of the
   other law is a crime. He cannot be absolved of guilt by drawing a distinction between the
   deed and the doing, such that the actual deed results in part from extraneous factors and is
   not his own doing. He definitely sets himself up in opposition to actuality: this is a formal
   presupposition of any human action. The act’s content involved a crime: siding with one law
   and violating the other. Later Hegel will consider this in more detail—in ¶473 (Hyppolite, II,
   p.35, n.32) or ¶659 (Jarczyk and Labarrière, I, p.755, n.57)—but it is clear for now that this is
   not the individual’s personal guilt. He is only a representative of his society, sex, or class. He
   is a generic Self, and also a specific Self, but not yet a fully individual Self, which will not
   appear until later.
¶469. 1. A reference to Oedipus, who unknowingly killed his father and married his mother.
   Hegel is implying that not-knowing or ignorance plays a similar role in both tragedies. This
   is false. Creon and Antigone were not unaware of the laws they contravened in the way that
   Oedipus failed to recognize his parents. Conversely, Oedipus was entirely aware of the
   divine laws against patricide and incest, but contravened them unwittingly.
       2. Any deed involves the actualization of a possibility, etc., and therefore guilt in Hegel’s
   sense. But it is unclear what bearing this has on Oedipus’s specific guilt, viz. that he was
   guilty of a crime even though he did not knowingly commit it.
¶470. 1. Sophocles’s Antigone, line 926. Antigone knew in advance the force of the law she
   violated and this compounds her guilt. Her action commits her to the view that an ethical
   purpose must be actualized in reality. However, this implies that the ethical purpose of the
   law she violates must also be actualized. In frustrating the actualization of this other
   purpose, she must therefore recognize her guilt.
¶471. 1. Recognizing the force of the law it violates, the agent (das Handelnde) retreats from
   purposive action to a mere disposition. This removes the character                        of the agent, and sets it
---
                                                                                              

    adrift. S/he cannot endure without an unequivocal allegiance to his or her law. Even without
    effective action, the hero(ine) has a pathos, an emotional commitment to the substance as
    s/he conceives it, and cannot survive the destruction of the value s/he championed.
¶472. 1. Given the parity of the two laws, they must suffer the same fate. Ordinarily they exist
    peacefully alongside each other. But the deed transforms each of them into a ‘self-essence’
    (Selbstwesen, a term that contrasts with Gemeinwesen: cf. ¶447), an essence endowed with a
    Self. Each self-essence is internally divided, not with respect to its pathos, since each self-
    essence has only one pathos, but with respect to its division into knowing and not-knowing,
    the not-knowing that leads to its guilt and destruction. Right requires the destruction of
    both parties. (Hegel may mean, alternatively, that the laws together become a single self-
    essence, which would be more obviously diverse than each taken separately.)
¶473. 1.    ‘True spirit’ means approximately ‘objective spirit’, as in ¶477.
        2. Since divine and human law play no obvious part in the quarrel between Eteocles and
    Polynices, which forms the background to the conflict between Creon and Antigone, Hegel
    presents it as a conflict between the self-conscious human order and the contingency of
    unconscious nature. Nature plays fast and loose with the ethical order rooted in it. It does so
    by blessing the incestuous union of Oedipus and Jocasta with two sons, Eteocles and
    Polynices (presumably twins with Eteocles born first—there were various versions of the
    story), when only one could become king. Because of a curse that Oedipus had cast on them,
    they quarrelled over which of them was to succeed him as king of Thebes. They came to an
    agreement to rule Thebes in alternate years, but Eteocles refused to abdicate after his first
    year in office. He sent Polynices into exile, but Polynices attacked Thebes in order to regain
    power. The brothers killed each other in the ensuing battle. The new king, Creon, forbade
    the burial of Polynices’s body.
¶474. 1. In general, the conflict is between the ethical community and nature. The defeat and
    subsequent treatment of Polynices who, as a solitary rebel, represents the family, offends the
    divine law, which is the ultimate source of the power of the community. The divine law
    enlists other communities to its cause. Thebes is later attacked and defeated by the ‘epigoni’,
    the sons of Polynices’s allies.
¶475. 1. What is represented in Greek tragedies looks like a sheer contingency, stemming
    from the pathos and doings of particular individuals. But in fact it signifies a deep conflict
    within ethical life between divine and human law, between the singularity characteristic of
    the family and the universality of the community. The community needs young men both to
    renew its ranks and to        fight in the wars resulting from its position as only one community
    among others. But behind every young man there stands a woman, nurturing his individu-
    ality and diverting him from the universal purpose of the community. Warfare is a solution
    to the dispersion this threatens; it represses individualism and secures the cohesion of the
    community. On the other hand, warfare gives prominence and power to young men,
    reinforcing their individualism. The community both represses and depends on the indi-
    vidualism rooted in the family. Initially, the familial gods of the household (the ‘Penates’)
    were absorbed into the community, but now the spirits of the city-states are absorbed into
    a vast empire (the Alexandrian and later the Roman Empire) in which individualism
    reigns supreme.
¶476. 1. The ethical substance collapses for two reasons, both stemming from its immediacy,
    its unmediated and unstructured relation to nature. First, it cannot reconcile unconscious
    nature with the self-consciousness of spirit. Secondly, it is inevitably limited and vulnerable
    to encroachment by other individual substances. Its naturalness is its limitation, but also its
    very essence or Self. Hence when it perishes, so does the living spirit that animates everyone.
    They cease to be a compact body of citizens and become a collection of separate individuals.

c. The state of right
¶477. 1.    ‘True’ (wahre) is here close to ‘objective’. It contrasts with subjective ‘certainty’, which
    is no longer the subjective identification with ‘substance’ that characterized the city-state
    and is now directed elsewhere.
        2. On ‘self-essence’, see ¶472. On ‘persons’, see PR ¶¶35f., and PH, p.317: ‘ “Person”,
    which involves the recognition of the independent dignity of the social unit—not on the
    ground of the display of the life which he possesses—in his complete individuality—but as
    the abstract individuum.’ The individual is now as empty and solitary as the dead individual
    in the ethical order, only he has now come to life as a mere self-conscious I.
¶479. 1.    ‘State of right’ is Rechtszustand. ‘State’ has the sense of ‘condition’, not of ‘political
    State’. Thus ‘state of right’ contrasts with ‘state of nature’, but here it contrasts primarily
    with the ethical order. Recht is ‘right’ or ‘law’, not in the sense of a legal code, but roughly
    that of ‘justice’. This stage corresponds to the Roman Empire: cf. PH, pp.314–18.
        2. Stoicism emerged from lordship and bondage in ¶¶197ff. Similarly, the state of right
    emerges from the ethical order which dominates the individuals in it (and also the conflict
    between human and divine laws). Hegel attempts to draw parallels between phases of spirit
    and earlier shapes of consciousness. Cf. ¶440, on sensory certainty, perception, and under-
    standing, and ¶¶480 and 483 on scepticism and unhappy consciousness.
¶480. 1. The independent self-consciousness of stoicism passed into scepticism: cf. ¶¶202ff.
    Scepticism was in utter disarray, e.g. doubting the reliability of sense-perception and
    ethical laws, yet dependent on them: cf. ¶205. Scepticism responded to this problem
    by insisting that it still has semblance or appearances in its possession. The state of right
    falls into an analogue of scepticism; ethical substance held individuals together in a
    coherent order, but empty persons are in disarray. The state of right responds to this
    by turning what it possesses into private property assigned to individuals and recognized
    as legitimate. It does not matter what the property is: it can be anything, as long as,
    formally, it is mine. Its content is all at the mercy of the emperor: ‘the whole empire was
    subject to the pressure of taxation and plunder’                    (PH, p.316). Hence           ‘person’   is often
    pejorative, expressing the lowest common denominator of human beings. On property
    and persons, see PR ¶¶34–70.
¶481. 1. PH, p.317 gives a similarly jaundiced account: ‘As, when the physical body suffers
    dissolution, each point gains a life of its own, but which is only the miserable life of worms;
    so the political organism is here dissolved into atoms—viz., private persons. Such a
    condition is Roman life at this epoch: on the one side Fate and the abstract universality of
    sovereignty; on the other, the individual abstraction.’                    A Roman emperor was usually
    declared to have been divine by his successor.
¶483. 1. On the parallel with the transition from Stoicism to scepticism, and from there to
    unhappy consciousness, see ¶480. Earlier, unhappy consciousness was something like a
    thought experiment, but now it has become a historical reality. The Self had not emerged in
    the Greek ethical world; it was absorbed in the ethical substance. Now it has emerged as the
    be-all and end-all, but it is thin and insubstantial, and at the mercy of caprice. It is therefore
    alienated from reality, i.e. from its own Self. Alienation will persist until the French
    revolution.

B .  SELF - ALIENATED SPIRIT . CULTURE
¶484. 1. Hegel uses two verbs, entfremden (‘alienate, estrange’) and (sich) entäussern (‘estrange,

    onyms. Hence I translate the words differently, entfremden as ‘alienate’ and entäussern as
    ‘estrange’. (Hyppolite reverses this, while Jarczyk and Labarrière render                           entfremden      as

                                                                                                         

    ‘aliéner’ and entäussern as        ‘extérioriser’.) In the ethical world the Self is in immediate unity
    with the customs, etc. of its society. It does not have to alienate itself from itself in order unite
    with its society and at the same time create that society. But that is just what the new discrete
    Self has to do. It faces a world that seems entirely alien to it. In fact, this world is its own
    product, not of its conscious doing, but of its abandonment of its own essence. If it does not
    alienate itself, it remains a self-enclosed person at the mercy of the external elements. So it
    alienates its status as a person in favour of a new social order that will arise from the rubble of
    the empire.
¶485. 1. With the coming of Christianity, the world divides into two worlds, the actual world
    here and now and the world beyond. In the actual world self-consciousness estranges itself
    and merges with a world that it nevertheless finds alien. But in a second alienation, pure
    consciousness projects a world beyond, which is the opposite of the world of the present and
    is a world constructed in thought. From now on, until the French revolution, spirit lives in
    one world but projects its essence into another.
¶486. 1. A summary of the whole of chapter VI. The actual world accommodates the two
    powers, the family and the State, in equilibrium, but each moment in it has its essence in
    the world beyond. Its stability therefore depends on alienation. The Greek world was
    divided into two laws, one knowing and the other unconscious, but it became a unitary
    Self in the Roman Empire. Analogously, these two worlds will be transformed by insight
    into single Self, but a universal Self that comprehends everything conceptually: cf. ¶¶527ff.
    Insight disrupts the social order and also the world of faith. It confounds faith’s house-
    keeping by interpreting this realm in secular terms: cf. ¶572. It replaces the two worlds
    with its own dualism of an unknowable god and a world governed by utility. This loss of
    substance results in absolute freedom, which repairs the alienation of spirit: cf. ¶¶582ff.
    Then spirit leaves the land of culture (France) and goes to the land of (Kantian) morality
    (Germany).
I. The World of self-alienated spirit
¶487. 1. The actual world is intrinsically self-alienated, since it involves the estrangement of
    self-consciousness: cf. ¶485. In response to this first alienation, spirit sets up the world of
    faith. But since the world of faith is a flight from the actual world, it is conditioned by the
    actual world and itself a second alienation. Faith is not religion. Faith is the stance of an
    individual which takes into account only one side of the equation, while religion is a
    society’s consideration of the whole development by which absolute spirit expresses itself:
    on faith cf. ¶¶7, 8, and 436. Since it is one-sided, faith confronts another opponent besides
    the actual world, for pure consciousness gives rise not only to faith but also to conceptual
    thought.

a. Culture and its realm of actuality
  ¶488. 1.     ‘Culture’    (Bildung) here covers every aspect of social life—political, economic,
    intellectual, etc.—and also suggests the idea of                 ‘forming, cultivating’ (bilden), since self-
    consciousness needs to give up its individual personality, cultivate itself and become
    universal. In contrast to the Roman world, where everyone acquired equality just by
    existing, self-consciousness attains equality and recognition only by its alienating integra-
    tion into culture.
¶489. 1.    ‘Alienation’ and ‘estrangement’             are more or less synonymous in the first two sen-
    tences, and elsewhere in the section on culture. The culture in which the individual counts
    only as a universal type is that of 17th–century (and, as the quotation indicates, 18th–century)
    France, where the monarch attempted to cultivate the nobility and turn them into uniform
    Frenchmen. The quotation is from                    Rameau’s Nephew, a dialogue by Denis Diderot

   (1713–1784), translated by Goethe in 1805: see ¶¶521ff. The French ‘espèce’ (‘species, sort,
   kind’) is often pejorative, and Hegel associates this with the French aversion to particularity or
   specificity. ‘Kind’ translates the German Art, also ‘sort, species’, but with no pejorative flavour,
   indicating that the Germans have no such addiction to a homogenizing culture. All three
   occurrences of      ‘meant’ translate gemeint, from           meinen.
¶490. 1. Because the individual can make his mark in the world only by appropriating a
   uniform culture and conforming to its institutions, in doing so he also elevates this cultural
   substance to actuality. It is the product of individuals even though it looks to them like an
   alien   fixture. The development of individuals and of society go hand in hand.
¶491. 1. This ¶ becomes clearer in the light of those that follow. The Self no longer regards
   itself as an individual, but is concerned only with the culture it has entered. The Self is like
   the soul of its society and articulates it into opposite moments or masses, such as State-
   power and wealth. These moments are not related immediately like the two laws of Greek
   ethical life, but each breathes life into the other, while they nevertheless remain separate.
   One of these moments is characterized as good and the other as bad. At first, it is State-
   power (or the public sector) that is good and wealth (or the private sector) that is bad: ¶495.
   But then the predicates switch sides and wealth becomes good, while State-power becomes
   bad: ¶497. Because of the interdependence of these masses, this alienating inversion is
   inevitable. But eventually the alternating alienation is overcome and we gain a conceptual
   mastery of the situation: ¶527.
¶492. 1. On the four elements, see Enc. II, ¶¶281–6. (1) The analogue of air is the spiritual
   essence universal in itself; (2) that of water, the essence that is for itself; and (3) that of fire,
   the essence as self-consciousness in and for itself, which embraces the other two. (1) is the
   State-power, which imposes uniformity on individuals, while (2) is the open arena where
   individuals, let go by (1), freely produce wealth. (3) is self-consciousness as a whole, which
   divides into (1) and (2) and controls them both. (1) will be dealt with in ¶493, (2) in ¶494,
   and (3) in ¶495. (1) and (2) correspond respectively to the commonwealth and the family in
   the Greek world, only they do not arise spontaneously from the earth, and are under the
   sway of self-consciousness. As Napoleon said to Goethe, politics has replaced fate: ‘La
   politique est la fatalité’ (PH, p. 278).
¶493. 1. Pure and actual consciousness correspond respectively to the world of faith and the
   actual world of ¶¶486f. Faith provides a commentary on the actual world. As represented by
   pure consciousness, as thoughts, the homogenizing power (State-power) is good, while the
   individualizing element is bad. This dissolution of universal uniformity is irremediable.
   Individuals are left to their own devices and inevitably pursue their own interests. How the
   situation is represented objectively, by actual consciousness, will be considered in ¶494.
¶494. 1. The thoughts of pure consciousness, which sees things only in terms of good and bad,
   are alienated into State-power and wealth as they appear to actual consciousness: cf. ¶493.
   State-power is the product of individuals, but they forget this and it becomes the basis of all
   their activity. It is, however, a pure abstraction when taken on its own. It can only be
   something determinate, State-power, if it has something else, an opposite, contrasting with
   it: wealth. The pursuit of wealth looks like a purely individual concern, but in fact it is
   as universal and spiritual as State-power. Like it or not, and believe it or not, in working
   for himself the individual works for everyone and everyone works for him.                              ‘Opine’
   translates meinen.
¶495. 1. The self-conscious subject is the third element of ¶492. He is not inextricably linked
   with either of the first two elements, since he is both Being-in-itself (as State-power is) and
   Being-for-itself (as wealth is), and supposes that he can choose between them. For this
   purpose he adopts from pure consciousness the thoughts of good and bad. But as actual
   consciousness he must attach these thoughts to real entities to form a judgement. It seems a
---
                                                                                                             

    foregone conclusion that he will judge State-power to be good and wealth bad. But matters
    are more complex in reality. The subject has a foot in each camp. The two elements
    interpenetrate, and each, like the subject itself, involves both Being-in-itself and Being-
    for-itself. So he must consider them from both points of view.
¶496. 1. Self-consciousness first considers the object in the light of its own Being-for-itself. An
    object is good if, and only if, it conforms to self-consciousness. Equally, if an object is good,
    it is good in itself. An object’s being good in itself and its being good for self-consciousness
    amount to the same thing; self-consciousness is a power that makes an object good in itself.
    Initially, an object, such as State-power, was in itself, and good in itself, independently of
    how self-consciousness rated it. But this second in-itself, mediated by self-consciousness,
    must be different from the            first, immediate in-itself of ¶495, just because it is mediated
    by spirit. This implies that self-consciousness is on the brink of changing its judgement of
    the object.
¶497. 1. State-power satisfies one side of consciousness, its Being-in-itself, but it does not
    satisfy its Being-for-itself, its individuality. Wealth, by contrast, does. So the initial judge-
    ment is reversed: State-power is bad and wealth is good.
¶498. 1. The two judgements are those of ¶497, that State-power is bad and wealth is good,
    which reverse those of ¶495, but are now reversed in turn. Now self-consciousness considers
    the question in the light of its own Being-in-itself. By this standard State-power is judged to
    be good, since it fulfils the essence or in-itself of consciousness. (This was acknowledged in
    ¶497, but overridden by Being-for-itself.) Wealth is bad, since it gives only individual
    enjoyment.
¶499. 1. All these judgements fall into two types. To judge something good is to find it like
    oneself, to judge something bad is to                find it unlike oneself. These two types of judging
    characterize consciousness itself and divide it into two shapes. If we apply the same standard
    to the judgings as they applied to their objects, we see that like-finding judging is good, and
    unlike-finding judging is bad. (It is unclear why this is so. To apply the same                        standard to a
    judging would be to ask not whether the judgement is like- or unlike-finding, but whether
    I find the judgement like or unlike myself. A judgement that something is bad (good) need
    not be a bad (good) judgement. Hegel tacitly assumes that neither State-power nor wealth is
    intrinsically bad and that the unlike-finder is a malcontent or misfit.)
¶500. 1. There are now two types of consciousness, the noble and the base or ignoble. The
    noble consciousness is satisfied both with State-power and with the economic system.
¶501. 1. The base consciousness finds both elements unlike. State-power is unlike conscious-
    ness itself, suppressing its Being-for-itself, while wealth is unlike the permanent in-itself.
    Overtly the base consciousness conforms to both, but hates State-power and despises
    wealth.
¶502. 1. Hegel intertwines logic with practical reality. These conflicting judgements are
    brought together by us philosophers, and seen to be suspect, but not by consciousness
    itself. From the logical point of view, they require deduction by a syllogism, so that
    consciousness itself can see which, if any of them, is correct. From the point of view of
    reality, the essences themselves are so far treated only as objects of judgement, as passive
    ‘predicates’. We have not seen how they manage their own development, as active ‘subjects’.
    This is why consciousness remains split into two one-sided judgers, surveying the essences
    from outside. The syllogism will remedy this. It will amount to an actual linkage between the
    judgers and the essences, putting the judgements into practical effect and showing how the
    noble consciousness cultivates itself and thereby generates the spiritual power of the State.
    This corresponds to the transition from feudalism to absolute monarchy: see PH, pp.398ff.
¶503. 1. State-power is not yet a Self. Cf. PH, p.403: ‘For many centuries the Kings of France
    possessed only a very small domain, so that many of their vassals were more powerful than
---
     

   themselves; . . . But that which essentially secured respect for royalty, even among the
   powerful vassals, was the increasing personal power of the sovereign.’
¶504. 1. The self-estrangement of the nobility syllogistically links the abstract State-power
   with concrete reality. In its service the nobility estranges itself. In so doing, it alienates its
   immersion in Being-there, i.e. its own particular local power. But this Being that it alienates
   has become the in-itself, i.e. the central State-power, and, conversely, the newly acquired
   value of the nobility.
¶505. 1. The nobility now obey the law, but not a supreme individual. They have estranged
   their way of life, but not their status as individuals. They serve the general will, not the will of
   an individual, and receive their honour from public opinion, not from a grateful individual.
   If there were a single individual for it to address, its language would be nothing more
   deferential than advice.
¶506. 1. The three ‘estates’ that structured feudal society were the noble warriors, the agricul-
   tural class, and the clergy. Since they retain their particular interest, their advice and
   conduct is equivocal and often at odds with the State and the universal interest. The
   noble consciousness is therefore not so different from the base consciousness.
¶507. 1. In ¶506 nobles who died in battle made the ultimate sacrifice, but those who survived
   were as haughty and independent as before. To solve the problem of Being-for-self ’s
   disparity with the State, we need to               find a form of estrangement that is as complete as
   death, yet leaves its victim alive and well. If the bare Self, purely in itself and stripped of all
   Being-for-self, alienates itself, then the State will become a Self.
¶508. 1. In laws, commands, and advice, the content of what is said matters. But all that
   matters here is language itself. It brings the singular Self into existence, or emergence, before
   others. Nothing else I do expresses the pure Self or I. It contains too much—it expresses a
   particular sort of Self, not the pure Self—or too little—I can always disown what I do. (If
   I say   anything definite, that also contains too much and too little. Hegel may mean that
   I only say ‘I’. But it is not clear that this is proper speaking unless I go on to say something
   definite; otherwise ‘I’ might be mistaken for               ‘eye’, ‘aye’, or a groan. However, what matters
   here is the sheer fact of my speaking. I cannot disown that—except by further speaking. It is
   unclear how Hegel would deal with parrots and Mynah birds.) The I that speaks is this
   singular I, but also the universal I, since everyone can apply                   ‘I’ to himself: everyone is an I:
   cf. ¶102. The fact that language is heard and dies away enables us to distinguish between a
   fleeting acoustic sound in the fugitive present (cf. ¶95), and the enduring universal Self
   available to other Selves.
¶509. 1. Spirit needs the actuality of language as a middle term between these two rigidly
   separated extremes, State-power and the nobility. Spiritual substance emerges only when it
   has got both extremes to appreciate the importance of language and the pure Self, and also
   to recognize that they involve alienation. Through language, each extreme becomes the self-
   knowing category (cf. ¶235), combining Being, or the abstract universal, with the Self, and
   thereby becomes a           fitting moment of spirit, which, through the alienating mediation,
   emerges as a spiritual reality. The extremes are already implicitly united in spirit, since
   although spirit depends on them, it creates them in their inchoate form. Thus spirit only
   actualizes their concept when it unites them by means of language.
¶510. 1. As noble consciousness sees it, each extreme has a good side and a bad side. Thus
   State-power is (G1) the abstract universal to be obeyed and (B1) a will for itself and at odds
   with (G1). Noble consciousness is (G2) an obedient and honoured side, and (B2) a will
   still ready to disobey. The good sides, (G1) and (G2), become moments of language,
   respectively the universal interest and the purified Self, and are, at bottom, the same. But
   only at bottom, since at         first only the nobility has an actual Self, while only State-power is
   the in-itself. The nobility needs not just honour, but to get State-power in its hands, while
---
                                                                                                        

    State-power needs to be obeyed as the deciding Self, not just as the universal interest. That
    is, each extreme needs to accommodate its bad side. State-power needs to become a will
    for itself, and the nobility is on the brink of rebellion. This unifying concept is accepted by
    both extremes, and it is actualized by means of language. This requires both extremes to
    be Selves, which means that State-power must be spiritually elevated into a Self, viz. a
    monarch. Hence the language used is transitional, not that of fully developed spirit. (Hegel
    does not explicitly call the sides            ‘good’   and   ‘bad’, but it looks as if good and bad have
    undergone a reversal.)
¶511. 1. Flattery is heroism because the flatterer sacrifices his very Self. The language of flattery is
    the middle term between the nobility and the State-power, and reflects each extreme back into
    itself, altering their nature in complementary ways. That is, the nobles abase and estrange
    themselves, while the State-power is elevated to an unlimited monarch. He is given a name,
    ‘Louis XIV’, to emphasize his singularity, and identifies himself with the State: ‘L’État, c’est Moi’.
¶512. 1. Nominally all power has been estranged by the nobles and passed over to the
    monarch. But in reality the power of the monarch depends entirely on the self-alienation
    of the nobility and they exact a quid pro quo. The monarch is just a figurehead. Real power
    is in the hands of the nobility. But since State-power has been consigned to a figurehead, it is
    transformed into wealth. The nobles want pensions and the monarch becomes a helpless
    dispenser of wealth.
¶513. 1. Initially the noble consciousness characterized itself by its conformity to power: cf.
    ¶500. Now it is doing its best to dismember it by getting a share of its wealth. It is riddled
    with incongruity. In giving up its will, it becomes unlike itself. In subjugating the substance,
    it makes the substance unlike itself, viz. unlike substance. The distinction between noble and
    base consciousness has disappeared.
¶514. 1. Wealth is dispensed by the monarch. But wealth has not yet become a Self, an
    independent power in its own right. It is simply a perversion of State-power. The noble
    Self just gratefully accepts the monarch’s gifts. It has not yet recognized wealth as an
    independent power that might be at odds with itself.
¶515. 1. Wealth involves conscious individuals, the monarch and the nobles whom he keeps at
    bay with it. But it is not an independent power, only a spin-off from the battered remnants
    of the State. Given its importance to its recipients, however, it needs to become a power in
    its own right, a central part of society, animated by a spirit of its own. We have seen
    movements of this form before, as the nobles gradually changed their attitude towards
    State-power.
¶516. 1. The nobles find their position humiliating and alienating. They do not receive wealth
    from an independent essence, deriving an income from shares on the stock market. They
    depend on an individual like themselves, another individual with a will of its own.
¶517. 1. A self-conscious individual has various aspects, its appearance, for example, its
    property, and its social status. But whatever its dependence on such aspects, it can abstract
    from them and insist on its worth simply as an I or Self. But now its very Self, its personality,
    is dependent on someone else. Whatever else the Roman Empire did, it recognized the pure
    Self. But the Self is now ‘outside itself ’          (ausser sich), i.e. in the sway of external forces, but
    also  ‘beside itself ’, in a very agitated state.
¶518. 1. The Self does in a way get recognition from wealth. The Self is handed back to itself
    on a plate. But this is not enough for it. That the Self should be in the gift of another
    contradicts the very essence of an I or Self. The Self is versatile. It survives and transcends
    this contradictory dismemberment of itself. It accepts the gift of itself with outward
    gratitude, but inwardly rebels against its treatment.
¶519. 1. The noble consciousness is now the same as the base consciousness, and this applies
    to the dispenser of wealth as well as its recipients. It is no longer just a beneficent individual
---
      

    but an established institution, dominating the whole lives of its clients. It is not an
    impersonal charity, however, but a wilful individual that has the Self in its power and
    knows it. Wealth is arrogant rather than rebellious, but otherwise as base as its clientele. It is
    too arrogant to notice the seething rebellion among the bare egos it has bought with its
    handouts, and the ubiquitous disharmony underlying the calm surface. This account is
    inspired by Rameau’s Nephew, by Diderot: see ¶¶489 and 521.
¶520. 1. Self-consciousness adopts two types of language in its approach to wealth. One is a
    language of flattery, which differs from the noble flattery of ¶511, where the Self, refined to a
    pure I by service, and State-power were essentially the same. Here, by contrast, the Self and
    the object of flattery are at variance. The other is the language of dismemberment, which
    aptly expresses the Self preserving itself in its alienation. In wealth the Self finds itself
    objectified in a certain way, as, say, a waiter. But the Self transcends and rejects this
    characterization of itself and insists on the identical judgement                        ‘I am me’. Equally it
    acknowledges the identity that wealth imposes on it and expresses an infinite judgement,
    such as ‘I am (just) a waiter’, whose terms are entirely incompatible: cf. ¶344 on ‘The Self
    is a thing’. This spirit is a divided personality, yet more fully self-aware than the noble
    flatterer. (My allusion to J.-P. Sartre’s example in Being and Nothingness is not entirely in
    bad faith.)
¶521. 1. The consciousness of pure culture, the quintessence of 18th–century France, becomes
    aware of the inversion that we philosophers noted earlier. All realities and thoughts —good/
    bad, State-power/wealth, etc.—lack any independent substance, depending only on their
    opposites and continually switching sides. The universal power, the monarch, is now no
    more than a name: cf. ¶511.             ‘Enculturates itself ’     translates sich einbildet, which usually
    means     ‘imagine, fancy, pride oneself ’, but is here used literally to mean something like
    ‘insinuates itself ’. It also suggests ‘culture’ (Bildung), however, as well as imagination and
    conceit. The true spirit of this alienated world is the witty conversation of pre-revolutionary
    France, which does no more than purvey this perversion. Hegel’s account is reminiscent of
    Thucydides’s account of the perversion of language during the revolution in Corfu (III,
    69–85), but is inspired rather by Rameau’s Nephew, a dialogue between ‘Moi’, an honest
    consciousness who vainly strives to maintain order and stability, and ‘Lui’, the nephew of
    the composer and a dismembered consciousness, who embroils                              Moi    in his subversive
    dialectic: see ¶¶489 and 519.
¶522. 1. The first quotation is from Diderot’s Rameau’s Nephew, XXI, Music. The second is
    put together by Hegel from various bits of the work. Despite                          Moi’s rebuke, Rameau’s
    frankness offers hope of a restoration of spirit.
¶523. 1.    Lui already knows everything that Moi can tell it. When Moi links together the good
    and bad, it is stating the obvious, that good and bad are conditions of each other. Immorality
    has good consequences. Criminals create employment for police, judges, and lawyers. Jack the
    Ripper inspired housing reforms in the East End of London. Iniquity calls forth heroism,
    generosity, and forgiveness. But even these are usually mixed with selfish motives.
¶524. 1. Examples of unmixed goodness are anecdotal and occasional. (If it were wholly
    disinterested, it would not be widely advertised, and so we might not know about it.)
    Removal from this perverse world is no solution. Even Diogenes (who is also mentioned in
    Rameau’s Nephew) depended on it, and such self-concern is itself bad. A Rousseauesque
    return to nature would eliminate the benefits of culture along with its defects. But it does
    suggest the true solution, that spirit must develop further and not retreat backwards.
¶525. 1. The onward advance of spirit is already underway in conscious awareness of the
    dismemberment and vanity of the world. The sniggering is that of Rameau. The                                     first
    reflection is the worldly dismembered consciousness that retreats into the Self; it is
    described in ¶526. The second reflection is the world of faith: cf. ¶¶442 and 486.

    This dismembered consciousness expresses to perfection the total vanity of its culture,
    including the power and wealth that it seeks. However, it rises above the vanity surround-
    ing it and, dissociating itself from any particular side in the conflict, withdraws into itself
    and thereby emerges as a unified Self, a new stage of spirit that will soon become pure
    insight.

b. Faith and pure insight
  ¶527. 1. The world of faith stems from the alienation of the world of culture. In reality, and
    for us, it is a world constructed in and by thought. But faith doesn’t realize this; it deals in
    pictorial representations, because, having ascended immediately from the sensory world of
    culture, it populates the Beyond with sensory images derived from the world it has left. Thus
    its in-itself, unlike that of Stoicism, is not in the form of thought: cf. ¶¶198ff. Unlike the in-
    itself of virtue and of law-giving and law-testing, faith’s in-itself is actualized, albeit in the
    Beyond: cf. ¶¶381ff., 419ff., 429ff. As compared with the faith that supplied the standard of
    good and bad to culture, it is greatly enriched by culture’s later development: cf. ¶493. Here,
    Hegel is trying to explain why faith is considered in detail only now, when it has been
    around since the beginning of culture; the real reason is that only now does it come into
    explicit conflict with secular thought.
¶528. 1. On the distinction between faith and religion, see also ¶¶487 and 675. Religion proper
    is knowledge, not just faith, and knowledge of the world as a whole, not a                           flight from the
    world. This faith differs from unhappy consciousness, which was just the subjective faith of
    a socially and historically unlocated individual, and also from Greek faith, which was
    directed towards the family, not the beyond. This faith has a social and historical location,
    but is opposed to the actual world and its self-consciousness, whereas religion proper unites
    the two worlds.
¶529. 1. Faith is pure consciousness, alienated from the actual world. It is thus intrinsically
    alienated and brings with it from the world a secular opposition to itself, intellectual insight:
    cf. ¶¶442 and 486. Faith is not blind; it has acquired intellectual sophistication from the
    world of culture and is therefore responsive to its free-thinking internal critic. Pure
    consciousness in general has retreated from the chaotic inversions of the actual world and
    into the Self, not the singular egoistic Self, but the universal rational Self, that surveys the
    world from a distance, both attacking it and finding repose in the world of thought. But then
    it splits in two, into negative insight, which is purely negative and critical, regarding
    everything that does not meet with its rational approval as worthless, and, on the other
    hand, positive faith, which projects an objective world beyond this world and beyond the
    Self. This world is a product of thought, though not of conceptual thought, and it therefore
    degenerates into a static pictorial representation: cf. ¶527. It thus has a content, whereas
    insight has only its negating Self.
¶531. 1. Here, and in the next two ¶¶, Hegel considers faith apart from its relations. The world
    of faith is supposed to be an ideal version of the real world. So it is articulated in the same
    way, only without alienation and inversion.                  For us     conceptual thinkers, the Trinity is a
    logically necessary sequence involving alienation, but for faith it is just one event after
    another.
¶532. 1. God the Father corresponds to State-power, the good. (Unsurprisingly, Hegel does
    not complete this analogy.) He passes over into Christ, an alienated Self. The holy spirit
    restores the unity of God and Christ.
¶533. 1. God, Christ, and holy spirit are removed from the actual world by thought and
    are thus immutable. They nevertheless have an effect on worldly self-consciousness.
    If God were not incarnated, He would remain alien. But Christ and holy spirit make Him

   accessible and allow the believer to participate in the world and not remain fixated on an
   unknowable God.
¶534. 1. This ¶ concerns faith’s relation to the world: cf. ¶530. Faith regards the world as vain,
   but does not engage in the equally vain high spirits of Rameau, and with cult and adoration
   it transcends the sensory world in order to achieve union with God. The individual does not
   attain this union, though the community of believers does, since in the Lutheran tradition
   God reveals Himself in the community. But for the individual the sacred events remain
   incomprehensible, as well as remote in space and time. The final sentence is a brief answer
   to the third question of ¶530: faith does not venture forth to do battle with insight.
¶535. 1. Insight is more intellectually combative than faith. It is nothing but intellectually
   combative.
¶537. 1. Insight has not yet fulfilled its mission and still appears only in isolated individuals.
   What it proposes is, first, to subject everything to conceptual comprehension, i.e. to reduce
   it to the Self, and, secondly, to awaken this comprehension in everyone, i.e. to make the Self
   universal, not a collection of singular Selves, each with its own particular nature. Social and
   intrinsic differences between individuals have been erased by culture. Genius, etc. may still
   occur, but they count only in the conflict-riven spiritual animal kingdom (cf. ¶¶397ff.) and
   the remnants of this will soon disappear. Individuals will no longer have their own
   particular purposes. They will all be devoted to the same enterprise, the conceptual conquest
   of the world. No doubt some will have more energy than others. But even this difference
   succumbs to the judgement: ‘I am my object’. This judgement is both identical, because the
   I and its object are the same, and infinite, owing to the initial disparity between the object
   and the I that comprehends it.
II. The enlightenment
¶539. 1. The tranquil consciousness was mentioned in ¶522. It is the calm philosopher
   surveying the dismemberment of culture. The philosopher puts together all the scattered
   gossip and presents it to the public.
¶540. 1. The whole confusion of this society is sustained by idle chatter. When someone, such
   as Montesquieu in his          Persian Letters, records it, he is still a singleton, not a universal Self,
   but he is on the way to becoming one by showing the vanity of such gossip and of its
   purveyors. Then someone else comes along, such as Voltaire in his Philosophical Dictionary,
   who collects the best bits of it together, thereby showing that this knowing-all is not an
   isolated phenomenon, and putting a universal stamp on it. This is insight’s battle against the
   world; now it turns against faith.

a. The struggle of the enlightenment with superstition
  ¶541. 1. We have seen negative movements before: scepticism (¶¶202ff.) and idealism
   (¶¶232ff., esp. 238, where idealism is compared with scepticism), but they had no specific
   historical and social context, and were not as comprehensive and as persistent as insight.
   Faith and insight are related, but while faith objectifies its unconceptual thoughts, setting
   them at odds with the Self, for insight the Self is all-important. Thus initially insight is
   entirely critical, but it acquires a content from its struggle against faith and becomes a
   substantial philosophy.
¶542. 1. Faith involves three elements: the duped masses, the priests who reserve insight for
   themselves and deceive the masses, and a despotism with one foot in the real world and the
   other in the ideal world of faith. Despotism maintains its power by exploiting the                          first two
   elements. On the intrigues of priests and despots, cf. ¶377.
¶543. 1. Enlightenment first turns its attention to enlightening the duped masses, because
   intellectual clarification is an aim it shares with faith. It cannot do much against deceiving
---
                                                                                                               

    priests and despotism, because its skills are intellectual rather than political. If it can enlighten
    the masses, it will break the hold that priests and despotism have on them. It can surely do
    this, since the masses are intrinsically rational, even if this concept has not yet been realized.
¶544. 1. In itself the naive mass is as rational as insight; faith involves thought. But it
    makes God, and His various accompaniments, into entities independent of itself, and
    regards them as its in-itself, disowning its own self-conscious rationality. However, the
    intrinsic rationality of the masses and their faith gives insight a foothold for realizing their
    rationality.
¶545. 1. Since insight and religious believers are on the same wavelength, insight has no
    difficulty in getting its message across. Thus slowly and imperceptibly it transforms the
    spirit of the age. Only later will faith notice that it has been penetrated by its opponent, and
    then it will be too late to do much about it. Symptoms of the infection may be noticed earlier
    and combated by ad hoc measures, but these only help insight to concentrate its forces more
    effectively. The quotation is from              Rameau’s Nephew, where it concerns the preaching of
    Jesuits to convert the Chinese and Indians to Christianity, but now it is turned against
    Christianity itself.
¶546. 1. There are two sides to insight: first, its silent weaving, whereby it changes the spirit of
    the age inconspicuously, as in ¶545, and secondly its noisy entry into open combat with
    faith, as in ¶¶547ff.
¶547. 1. Pure insight is now also pure intention, since it will accuse its opponent of insincerity
    as well as error. It is inevitably negative, since it has no content of its own. But it has no
    opponent outside itself, since it is includes everything in its conceptual embrace, everything,
    that is, except itself. So it has to pick a quarrel with itself, turning itself into unreason and
    insincerity. That is, insight gives a distorted account of faith.
¶548. 1. Unwittingly, insight is shadow-boxing. This must be so, since insight claims to subject
    everything to conceptual comprehension and therefore make it rational. So if faith were
    quite other than insight, faith would be rational. Since it is irrational, it can only be the dark
    side of insight itself. (Hegel here seems to conflate different senses of                      ‘rational’: someone’s
    belief might be rational in the sense of                ‘rationally explicable or comprehensible’, yet not
    rational in the sense of         ‘based on good evidence’.) The real significance of the conflict is
    reason’s development of itself, its becoming its own content. One phase of this is its
    objectification of itself as God, etc. What it should do is recognize this as its own content
    and transform it conceptually. But at first it finds it quite alien and approaches it negatively.
    For us, or in itself, enlightenment is combating its own errors. But at first it appears to faith
    as purely negative, and a tissue of errors and lies. And that is how enlightenment views faith,
    while faith is really its own unacknowledged content.
¶549. 1. Enlightenment levels two charges against faith: that God is only a product of its own
    thought, and that God is alien to it. Faith accepts the first charge, but insists that it does not
    follow that God is a fiction; God is the essence of man’s self-consciousness. Faith only does
    what insight in general does: it permeates objects with its own consciousness. Consequently,
    faith is not simply belief. It is also trust or the              fiducia of Lutheran theology. The believer
    trusts God as he trusts himself—or even more, since, seen through God’s eyes, he sheds his
    singularity and becomes pure insight, while retaining his self-consciousness. Like insight in
    general, the believer not only recognizes himself in his object, but also sees that his unity
    with the object results from his own doing. God is the spirit of the faithful community and
    He can only be this owing to communal worship. However, man’s doing is only a necessary
    condition of his relationship to God, not a sufficient condition. God still remains an
    objective entity in His own right.
¶550. 1. Enlightenment contradicts itself when it claims that God is entirely alien to the
    believer, while admitting that he locates his very essence in God. The question whether it
---
     

   is permissible to deceive a people was proposed in 1778 by Frederick the Great as the subject
   for an essay competition run by the Berlin Academy of Sciences.
¶551. 1. The three moments are God, the justification of faith, and worship. It emerges in
   ¶554, where the second moment is considered, that the three moments correspond to the
   three persons of the Trinity.
¶552. 1. Faith represents God in sensory objects, in the stone or wood from which it carves an
   image, and in the wafer made from corn which faith supposes to be Christ’s body. Pure
   insight perversely interprets this to mean that faith worships a stone, etc., which surely is
   alien to self-consciousness. An alternative would be to say that faith worships pure thinking
   congealed into an in-itself that is merely represented by stone, etc. But since insight
   acknowledges no such in-itself, it foists on faith the sensory object. Insight and faith are
   both contemptuous of finite sensory objects, but each in their own way. (In his Philosophical
   Dictionary, p. 239, Voltaire avoids this error, distinguishing between worship of a stone and
   worship of a divinity, albeit false, represented by it.)
¶553. 1. Enlightenment’s profession of purity includes its contempt for transitory sensory
   things, which it seeks to transform into thoughts. But it will not acknowledge that faith is
   doing something similar. Faith knows, as well as insight does, that a stone is also a stone, but
   it does not worship a stone as a stone. It does not even regard such things as stones as the
   rock-bottom reality. That is rather pure thinking or God.
¶554. 1. In ¶552 enlightenment reduced faith’s relation to God to a relation to sensory objects.
   It now reduces faith’s knowledge to reliance on dubious reports of contingent events. This is
   something that enlightenment itself is prone to, but unaware as ever of its own nature, it
   projects this onto faith. In reality, faith’s relation to God is immediate, but like all imme-
   diacy it also involves mediation, a thoughtful attempt to convert inner certainty into
   knowledge of the truth. This is what enlightenment itself primarily does, but it does not
   recognize its own affinity to faith. The true basis of faith is the direct witness of the divine
   spirit to the human spirit (a feature of Lutheranism), and also the presence of this spirit in
   the community, the Christian tradition (a feature of Catholicism, to which Hegel is usually
   hostile). If faith does appeal to historical evidence it is because it has been corrupted by
   enlightenment in trying to defend itself against it.
¶555. 1. The activity of the faithful, such as abstention from enjoyment and giving up property
   (see ¶556), is intended to eliminate the individual’s particularity and to unite him with God.
   Insight adopts a negative attitude towards this activity and, as in the other cases, fails to
   recognize the affinity of faith to itself. So although faith’s activity is an appropriate means for
   achieving its purpose, insight has to deny this and view faith’s intention as lacking in insight
   or means-ends rationality. To make this plausible it also has to reject faith’s purpose and
   make pleasure and property the purpose instead.
¶556. 1. Enlightenment believes that faith has chosen inappropriate means for its purpose.
   Abstinence does not show one’s freedom from pleasure. It is foolish to give up one’s
   property, ignoring one’s obligation to maintain an individual presence in the community.
   Pure insight claims to share faith’s aim of rising above pleasure and property, but since it
   opposes the pursuit and expression of this aim in deeds, it ends up by regarding pleasure
   and possession as an end-in-itself and endorsing the world of utility.
¶557. 1. Enlightenment presented itself to faith in a negative way, though pure insight and
   intention had to come in too, for otherwise they would not have become apparent. Now
   the question is: what is pure insight positively? In its combat with error it revealed that it
   regards all determinacy as finitude and therefore removes it from God. So God becomes a
   vacuum which takes no predicates. To join God together with sensory things and
   predicates would give rise to superstition. So enlightenment is left with an unbridgeable
   chasm between the realm of             finite things and a remote and unknowable God. It derives a
---
                                                                                                  

    wealth of material from its opposite, faith, viz. all the finite things that it must keep away
    from God.
¶558. 1. Consciousness has reverted to its most primitive shape, sensory certainty. ‘Meaning’
    translates    Meinung, as in the account of sensory certainty: see chapter I. But sensory
    certainty is now enriched by the previous experience from which it has emerged. It is no
    longer simply meaning, an exclusive focus on a particular individual, nor is it just opinion. It
    is a general doctrine, justified by the demolition of alternative shapes of consciousness and
    by the removal of anything beyond the sensory world. Consciousness is certain not only of
    its own existence, but also that every consciousness is certain of its own existence and of the
    existence of things outside it.
¶559. 1. Insight needs to encompass everything in a balanced equilibrium. But the finite world is
    bounded     and therefore restricted by something beyond it. But now it is left hanging without
    support. An appropriate relation to God might solve this problem, except that the God of
    18th–century deism is a void without content. This relation can therefore be conceived in
    different ways. It can be regarded in a positive light, such that God, as the in-itself, confers real
    Being-in-itself on      finite things. Or it can be viewed negatively, so that they have no reality of
    their own but exist only in the eyes of God or, more abstractly, for an other. Insight has thus
    replaced culture’s dichotomy of good and bad with its own dichotomy of Being-in-itself and
    Being-for-another: cf. ¶491. However, given the reversion to sensory certainty in ¶558, there is
    also an implicit reference to the transition from sensory certainty to perception in ¶111.
¶560. 1. God has served the purpose of introducing the concepts of Being-in-itself and Being-
    for another, and now these concepts are brought down to earth. Everything is now both in
    itself and for an other, i.e. useful. Man is a natural creature and enjoys things, as animals do.
    But unlike them, he is endowed with reason which deters him from consuming more than is
    good for him. Reason restricts his present consumption but enables him to save for the
    future, so that the variety and duration of his pleasure is not curtailed. On measure and
    measurelessness, see         Enc. I, ¶¶107–11.
¶561. 1. Enlightenment believes that, in its conflict with faith, it has acquired a religion, a
    religion of utility. It conceives utility in religious terms, as a fall from grace.
¶562. 1. The quasi-Christian cult of the supreme Being was introduced by Robespierre in 1794
    in opposition to the atheistic cult of reason.
¶563. 1. As faith sees it, enlightenment distorts all the elements of its coherent system of
    thought. While faith’s right is divine, enlightenment’s is merely human, the right of self-
    consciousness to pick holes in an elaborate construction of thought. However, enlighten-
    ment is not simply taking a position in opposition to faith. It is exploiting elements that are
    present within faith itself and conducting an internal critique of faith. Faith is vulnerable to
    enlightenment’s attack because it is already half in agreement with it.
¶564. 1. Enlightenment assembles, and conceptually knits together, thoughts that are present
    in faith, but some of which it forgets. For example, the idea that things are useful for each
    other concerns faith as well as enlightenment.
¶565. 1. Faith does not bring all its thoughts together. But nor does enlightenment. For it
    regards faith as the sheer negation of itself, and does not recognize itself in faith. What needs
    to be done in such cases is to bring the seemingly contradictory thoughts together so as to
    form a single conception. This is what enlightenment expects faith to do. But it should also
    do the same itself, integrating the two opposites into a coherent whole. In fact, such a
    coherent concept does emerge from the conflict, but enlightenment is not aware of
    producing it, nor of the nature of the concept itself, viz. that it is what split into faith and
    enlightenment in the          first place. It is enlightenment that produces this concept, because
    enlightenment is the active party, bringing out and together the disparate thoughts of faith.
    But it is faith that supplies the raw material from which the concept is constructed.

¶566. 1. Faith and enlightenment are both involved in contradictions that need to be unrav-
   elled. Faith maintains that (1) God is the in-itself and not produced by its own thought, but
   (2) faith’s service makes God into the believer’s                    own absolute essence, and (3) God is
   inscrutable and inaccessible. There is tension between (1) and (2) and between (2) and (3).
   Enlightenment maintains that (4) God is nothing but a product of faith’s activity and
   consciousness, relying on the images and representations to which enlightenment reduces
   faith’s God, but (5) faith’s God is alien and unknowable, which is equivalent to (3). The final
   sentence recalls St Paul: ‘How unsearchable are His judgements, and His ways past finding
   out!’  (Romans 11:33).
¶567. 1. Faith is ambivalent towards sensory things. It does not regard stone, etc. as wholly
   unconnected with God. To deface a religious image is sacrilegious, not simply destructive.
   Faith represents the supersensory realm in a sequence of sensory events. Enlightenment is
   ambivalent in a different way. For it sensory things are                       finite and devoid of spirit, not
   nothing, but not exactly something either.
¶568. 1. Faith involves two types of knowledge; one depends on contingencies, such as sacred
   texts and images; even knowledge of God, as a represented entity, is of this sort. The other
   depends on the spirit that gives the certainty and truth of itself. In the latter type there is
   immediate communication between the Self and God. Faith tends to forget the                               first type of
   knowledge, while enlightenment forgets the second.
¶569. 1. Faith itself acknowledges the importance of property and enjoyment. In its cult it
   makes a symbolic sacrifice of both, but in its daily life it retains them.
¶570. 1. The symbolic sacrifice in the cult is supposed to elevate the believer entirely above his
   sensory nature. But a single sacrifice cannot have this universal effect. Not even the (alleged)
   self-castration of Origen (184/5–253/4), inspired by Matthew 19:12, was enough.
¶571. 1. Enlightenment isolates the internal, the intention, just as previously it isolated the
   external, the mere wood and stone, failing to acknowledge their significance for faith. Faith
   does not intend to rid itself entirely of natural functions. The aim of its symbolic sacrifice is
   to give them spiritual significance and keep them in their proper place. For enlightenment,
   by contrast, these functions are purely natural and this is their justification.
¶572. 1. Faith cannot resist enlightenment’s attack because it is in half agreement with
   enlightenment. Faith lives in two worlds, one mundane and one heavenly. Even its heaven
   is populated with representations derived from the sensory world. Faith’s thought is non-
   conceptual, so that it cannot coherently integrate its two worlds. But since it is a single self-
   consciousness, it cannot deny the disparity of its two lives once it is pointed out.
¶573. 1. Deprived of its content, faith is now the same as enlightenment. Heaven has gone,
   and all it has left is earth, its own singular Self along with finite things with no spiritual
   significance. Beyond there is emptiness, at most a remote and unknowable deity, which
   cannot be described without illegitimately plagiarizing the sensory language of the earth.
   Enlightenment is satisfied with this, but faith is not. However, enlightenment is less satisfied
   than it seems. There is trouble afoot in its gesture towards an empty god, in its movement
   beyond its singular Self, and its lurch into disinterested utility.

b. The truth of enlightenment
  ¶574. 1. Faith has established an empty god beyond itself. Meanwhile, pure insight is more
   active and attempts to realize itself. It does so by postulating an equally pure negation of
   itself, viz. pure matter, underlying everything else but with no determinacy of its own. The
   indeterminacy of matter corresponds to the thinking by which insight arrives at it, the
   drawing of distinctions without a difference, which then subside from pure thinking to a
   pure thing. (Here, and elsewhere, Hegel sees an affinity between denken, ‘think(ing)’ and
   Ding, ‘thing’.) Featureless matter is really just a projection of self-consciousness itself, the
---
                                                                                                               

    opposite pole of the magnet, as it were: cf. ¶¶158ff. It is thus the same as the unknowable
    God that emerged from faith’s unconscious weaving. But insight does not recognize any of
    this. It regards its absolute, whether matter or God, as an objective Beyond, and conscious-
    ness itself as simply finite.
¶575. 1. Enlightenment now splits into two parties over the nature of the absolute essence.
    One regards it as God, the other as matter. This is good for enlightenment, since it removes
    its one-sidedness, and also for faith, since it purifies itself and joins the victorious side.
¶576. 1. The absolute essence begins as pure thinking, but it becomes matter in the following
    way. It is the negative of self-consciousness, therefore it is Being, and Being related to self-
    consciousness. Self-consciousness contains tastes, colours, smells, etc., and these are trans-
    ferred to the absolute essence. So the absolute essence becomes matter, the outer Being
    which produces tastes, etc. Hence self-consciousness is related to the essence by sensory
    certainty and perception.
¶577. 1. We can also go in the reverse direction, from sensory Being to pure thinking. If we
    abstract from seeing, etc., we are left with sheer matter, which is not what is seen, tasted, etc.
    It is a pure abstraction.
¶578. 1. Deism or idealism starts from pure thinking and projects God beyond                                    finite con-
    sciousness. It stops there and so misses out nature. It should go on to say that the negative of
    consciousness is nevertheless related to it. Then God would turn out to be a being external
    to consciousness, and much the same as pure matter. That would bring deism into contact
    with nature. Materialism starts from sensory Being, abstracts from seeing, etc., and makes
    sensory Being into pure matter. Materialism stops there, and so misses out spirit or self-
    differentiating consciousness. It should go on to note that in becoming a predicateless simple,
    this Being has become the essence of consciousness; and that a being, when refined to purity,
    becomes the same as its pure negative, viz. a thought. Thus if deism and materialism think
    their positions through to the end, they amount to the same. They both neglect Descartes’s
    doctrine, that Being and thinking are at bottom that same, that pure Being is an abstraction
    and that, conversely, pure thinking entails the Being of a thinker and is, in any case, the same
    abstraction as pure Being. (The reference is to Descartes’s                   cogito sum, which does not entail
    that thinking and Being are the same. In any case, Hegel’s own argument implies only that
    pure Being is the same as pure thinking, not that thinking and Being in general are the same.)
¶579. 1. For the image of axial rotation, cf. ¶169 on life. Pure thinking of itself involves two
    moments, Being and the negative. These rotate around an axis, each succeeding, and
    succeeded by, the other. This rotation bursts asunder, leaving on one side sheer Being,
    whether God or matter, and, on the other, utility, which is the upshot of both deism and
    materialism. Utility also involves alternating moments, but three rather than two. But this
    alternation does not return into itself in the way that the other returned into pure Being. It
    continues endlessly from one thing to another.
¶580. 1. We saw that pure insight actualizes and differentiates itself at the beginning of ¶574.
    To be useful an entity must have a definite nature of its own or be something in itself, such
    as grass. But grass is for an other, since it is eaten by a cow. Then the grass is for itself, having
    actualized its potential in the cow. However, the cow does not remain for itself for long. It
    too is in itself, with a nature that is for          a human being, who then actualizes the potential of
    the cow by eating it. The human being is also in itself, but then for another too, since he is
    useful in turn, perhaps for sowing the grass that feeds the cow that feeds himself, thereby
    coming back in a circle, perhaps for working in a factory and thereby extending the
    alternating chain of in itself/for another/for itself. A human being is also ‘for itself ’ in another
    sense, that is, it is a conscious Self. But this sense of ‘Being-for-itself ’                  is not relevant to the
    process of utility. Insofar as he is useful, a human being is simply one link in the chain, not a
    Self that overarches the other links. This role is reserved for pure insight itself, which is aware
---
      

    of all the links and how they hang together. But pure insight is not itself a member of the
    alternating chain. It surveys it from a distance. So insight now has a world, but a world that
    has two defects, first that none of the entities in it is self-supporting, but each is propped up by
    something else, and secondly that it has no place in it for the Self that surveys it.
¶581. 1. So far we have seen three worlds and three types of Self in chapter VI.B: (1) In the
    dispersed world of culture there was no single type of Self, but a great variety of them, united
    only by the vanity in which they end up. (2) In the world of faith, the Self withdraws into
    itself and acquires a generic unity. But it degenerates into a world dominated by the absolute
    essence, either as a pure thought, God, or as matter. Neither of these give it a secure position
    in the world and the subjective self-certainty that the Self of (1) had. (3) The world of utility
    combines the advantages of (1) and (2) without their disadvantages. The Self has subjective
    self-certainty as it did in (1), but without the rootless chaos that came with it. It knows the
    truth as well: it has a thorough insight into the complexity of the world it inhabits. Unlike
    the Self in (2) it has an assured place in that world: it is useful to others and others are useful
    to it. So far, so good.
III. Absolute freedom and terror
¶582. 1. So far utility is still accepted only as a predicate of objects, and the world of utility is
    regarded as an object which requires no intervention from the subject that surveys it. The
    Self ’s position in this world is that of something that uses other things and is used by them
    in turn. The next step, however, is already implicit in this. It is for the Self to be not simply a
    link in the utility chain but to regard utility as only utility for the Self. It then asks what is
    useful for itself and may well decide that, for example, such institutions as the monarchy are
    not useful for itself. Utility then will be not simply objective but something that requires the
    Self ’s practical intervention.
¶583. 1. There are now two Selves. One is the particular Self within the network of utility, a
    Self for which things are useful and which is, in turn, useful for other Selves and other
    things. The other is the universal Self that surveys and comprehends this system as its
    object. This is the Self as metaphysician. This Self is no longer content with its subordinate
    role in the network of utility. It wants to enter the network itself, to take possession of it, and
    to reorder the whole system in its own image. Cf. PH, p.446: ‘The consciousness of the
    Spiritual is now the essential basis of the political fabric, and Philosophy has thereby become
    dominant.’
¶584. 1. Cf. PH, p.443: ‘Rationality of Will is none other than the maintaining one’s self in
    pure Freedom—willing this and this alone—Right purely for the sake of Right, Duty purely
    for the sake of Duty. Among the Germans this view assumed no other form than that of
    tranquil theory; but the French wished to give it practical effect.’                        On the uniformity of
    rational will, cf. PR ¶15 Addition:             ‘The rational is the high road where everyone travels,
    where no one is conspicuous.’             On the controversial relation of Hegel to Rousseau, whom
    Hegel has in mind here, see Stern (2002), pp.157–62.
¶585. 1. The conceptual articulation of society into                     ‘masses’    or ‘members’, distinct groups
    and    estates    with    different    functions,      depends      on    people’s     conscious      acceptance      of
    them. Once they no longer tolerate such limitation, but regard sheer self-consciousness as
    all that matters, the ordered system collapses and becomes a mere concept without
    embodiment.
¶586. 1. There is no question of utility any more, since there is no longer any diversity.
    Consciousness is not faced with an objective system which it might                              find alien. Its only
    object is consciousness itself. The only opposition is between the singular individual and the
    universal consciousness. But the individual knows that though he                          seemed     to have a mind
    and a will of his own before, that was only apparent and he has now merged with the
---
                                                                                                              

    universal consciousness and will. A vacuous god hovers over the ruins. On the être suprême
    and Robespierre’s institution of its worship, see ¶562.
¶588. 1. The revolutionary consciousness cannot tolerate anything independent of itself. To
    do so would involve articulating society into stable masses, whether into legislative, judicial,
    and executive powers (recommended by Montesquieu, but derided by Rousseau) or, more
    realistically, into occupational groups, the estates. Individuals would then be detached from
    the universal will and become limited specialists. The universal Self must make and carry
    out the law itself. It is not enough just to represent or imagine it as obeying laws it has given
    itself. Representation-by-proxy is a fraud: the Self is not really there, only represented or
    imagined as such. ‘Representation’ and ‘represented’ translate Vorstellung and vorgestellt,
    while    ‘representation/represented-by-proxy’               translates the French-derived Repräsentation
    and repräsentiert.
¶589. 1. A single individual is not adequately fulfilled in the creation of an articulated social
    order, as we saw in ¶588. But nor is it in the acts of the executive or government. Positive
    actions can only be performed by a single individual, and that excludes other individuals.
    The joint work of everyone together can only be negative and destructive.
¶590. 1. The sole remaining opposition to universal freedom, now that it has demolished all
    other institutions, are the free individuals of which it consists. They lack any attachment or
    status apart from their bare individuality, but are nevertheless not totally absorbed into the
    homogeneous mass. They persist as rigid points. (Hegel generally uses                                   Punktualität,
    ‘punctuality’, in its root meaning, connecting it with geometrical or atomic points.) The
    only thing to do with them is to kill them. The death chosen for them, beheading by the
    guillotine, is entirely appropriate to their bare, punctual nature. In lectures of 1805–1806
    Hegel called this the       ‘despotism of liberty’.
¶591. 1. The syllable is          ‘death’   (Tod). The government represents the universal will in its
    actions. But since it performs positive acts, it can only consist of definite individuals,
    excluding other individuals. Hence it is a faction and thereby at odds with the universal
    will, against which it has thus committed a crime. In return the government has no definite
    charge to level against the faction opposed to it, since this faction is not in power and has not
    done anything definite. What it can accuse it of, however, is its intention, what it would do if
    it could, which since it is directed against a government identifying itself with the universal
    will, is directed against the universal will itself. So the opposing faction falls under suspicion
    and therefore deserves to die. The government itself will fall victim to this logic when it loses
    power to the other faction.
¶592. 1. Things have not turned out as self-consciousness expected. In its fear of death it sees
    the downside of freedom: cf. the bondsman in ¶194. It now faces the concrete reality of its
    essence, pure thinking as positive and matter as negative: pure thinking makes the transition
    to pure matter, i.e. it dies.
¶593. 1. The negation within absolute freedom, viz. death, enables it to establish a substance of
    sorts, namely a graveyard populated by the material remains of its victims. Since this does
    not appeal to individuals, they arrange themselves in a social order articulated into masses
    once more. Like the bondsman in ¶194 they have been disciplined by their fear of death and
    willingly submit to their limited role in what has become a deferential society once more.
    This recasting of society was largely the work of Napoleon.
¶594. 1. We might expect spirit to be embarked on a cyclical history, reverting to the ethical
    world and, refreshed by its fear of the master, death, merging the individual into substance,
    then proceeding to culture, then to revolution again. This would be so, if the result of
    revolution were the complete interpenetration of substance and the individual, character-
    istic of ethical life. But it is not. Absolute freedom does not involve interaction between a
    determinate, substantial individual and a determinate external world, but between the
---
      

    universal will and a Self stripped of all definite characteristics, of honour, wealth, even of
    heaven, and facing only death. This is negative, but it veers round into something positive,
    into a Self that withdraws into itself and becomes pure knowing and pure will. Its knowing
    and willing are only formal (as they are in Kant’s ethics). It is unconcerned with politics and
    economics. That sphere too is purely formal and something it no longer knows about. What
    matters is just knowing itself. This is comparable to the bondsman’s retreat into Stoicism in
    ¶¶197ff., only greatly enriched by the intervening experience. In ¶593 absolute freedom
    subsided into a restored social order. But that was in France. Spirit has now migrated to
    Germany.
¶595. 1. In reducing the opposition between universal and singular will to a transparent form,
    spirit overcomes its alienation. The other land into which absolute freedom passes over is
    Germany. There spirit is and remains ‘thought’                   (Gedanke). It does not actualize itself in a
    new social order.
C .  SPIRIT CERTAIN OF ITSELF .             MORALITY
¶596. 1. The individual had no special status in the ethical world, except in death. He
    resurfaced as the abstract person of the Roman world. This Self became concrete in culture
    and faith, but so alienated that substance turned into universal will, and now at last this has
    become knowledge and passed into the individual Self. Hitherto there has always been a gulf
    between the Self ’s certainty of itself and its truth, between what the Self thinks it is at bottom
    and ought to be in reality, on the one hand, and, on the other, the world that it set up and
    that did not meet its requirements. But now there is no opposition between the Self and the
    world. The Self is just pure knowing, with no private purposes, and its object is pure
    knowing too. It is oblivious to the world outside it. It seems that certainty and truth now
    coincide and that nothing can go wrong.
¶597. 1. The Greek ethical spirit was immediate. It knew its duty and just did it. But it had a
    definite character and was duty-bound to only one side of the ethical whole and oblivious to
    the other. Culture and faith involved mediation. They were consciously aware of the whole
    complexity of their world and developed it themselves. But they were racked by alienation.
    The moral consciousness combines immediacy and mediation, only without their disad-
    vantages. It is immediate, since it just knows its duty and does it. It is mediated, since it too
    has developed itself out of the alien world and has an understanding of what it is up to. It is
    immediate, again, in the sense that it has no substance except its own knowledge and self-
    certainty. It has extracted itself from alien Being and is now all the Being there is.
¶598. 1. Knowledge is all Being or actuality, because only what it knows counts for the moral
    consciousness. Oedipus came to grief, from his not knowing that the man he killed was his
    father and the woman he married was his mother. But the moral consciousness would
    excuse him for what he did unknowingly.
a. The moral world-view
¶599. 1. For moral consciousness as self-consciousness, all that matters is duty, which is not at
    all alien to it. However, as mediation and negativity, it essentially involves otherness, of
    which it is therefore conscious. This otherness is nature, which consciousness ignores in
    favour of an exclusive focus on duty. It leaves nature, Being-there, to its own devices. Nature
    has its own laws and is entirely indifferent to morality. Nature’s freedom increases along
    with that of moral consciousness.
¶600. 1. Morality and nature are each independent and self-sufficient. The moral conscious-
    ness has two conflicting views of their relationship. One is that morality and nature have
    nothing to do with each other. The other is that duty is all-important, nature is dependent
    and must conform to the requirements of duty. The moral world-view develops through an
    attempt to deal with this conflict.
---
                                                                                                      

¶601. 1. This concerns Kant’s postulate of a necessary harmony between morality and nature
   or happiness, with God as the intermediary:               Critique of Practical Reason, IV. On the first of
   the presuppositions of ¶600, that morality and nature each go their own way, the moral
   consciousness just does its duty regardless of whether this brings it happiness. On the
   second presupposition, that nature is dependent, it complains if it does not win happiness.
   This is morally suboptimal, introducing a factor other than duty and implying not only that
   nature should ensure the success of the dutiful deed, but that it should make the agent happy
   as his reward.
¶602. 1. Morality requires dutiful agents and therefore their happiness. The happiness it
   requires is the pleasure the singular agent derives from the success of his deed, e.g. that
   the coin he gives to a beggar should benefit the beggar and not fall down a drain or get him
   mugged. (As far as Hegel’s argument goes, it does not require that the agent should be
   happy in other respects, e.g. that he should not suffer from migraine, except insofar as this
   might interfere with his performance of duties.) That the agent should enjoy the success of
   his deed is a conceptual requirement of morality. Even as a disposition, morality is
   necessarily a disposition to do something that actualizes the disposition. Even though
   nature does not invariably harmonize with morality, the requirement of it is not just a
   wish, but a necessary demand or postulate of reason.
¶603. 1. Nature also appears within moral consciousness in the form of natural urges,
   sensibility. Like external nature, sensibility goes its own way and may not be in harmony
   with duty. In fact it is a presupposition of morality that sensibility should not be subservient
   to it, since there is no moral merit in simply doing what one wants to do anyway. However,
   it is also a requirement of morality that sensibility should be brought into harmony with
   duty. This is not, as in ¶602, simply a demand, but a task to be striven for by the moral
   consciousness itself. If this task were completed, however, morality would be eliminated
   entirely, since it would no longer have any recalcitrant urges to resist. The moral conscious-
   ness solves this problem by postponing its completion to infinity. It is a goal to be
   approached asymptotically but never reached. This is like someone whose purpose in life
   is to reach the number 1 by counting 0, ½, 34 , . . . 1. He wants to reach 1, but equally he
   doesn’t, because if he did, he would have to stop counting.
¶604. 1. The postulate of ¶602 concerns a problem about external nature that the moral
   consciousness cannot manage itself, only God. That of ¶603 concerns a problem about
   our internal nature that we have to deal with, assuming that we survive long enough. Both of
   them involve action on our part, but the harmonies and their moments are only in our
   thought. They do not actually confront us in the situation in which we act. The postulate
   that follows concerns a conflict presented to us by external nature, but intruding into
   consciousness itself and such that we have to deal with it in the moral situation.
¶605. 1. The moral agent wants to do his pure duty, what it really ought to do. But situations
   are complex and often present one with a variety of duties, of things that one prima facie
   ought to do. There is also a problem about what the agent knows and what he does not, but
   that will come up in ¶608. Only pure duty is sacrosanct. None of the various duties is itself
   sacrosanct. Nevertheless, they are an essential feature of the moral situation and must exist.
   But where? It can only be in another moral consciousness, namely, God.
¶606. 1. Human moral consciousness wills pure duty, regardless of its determinate content.
   The divine consciousness sustains and sanctifies determinate duties. It thus combines the
   universal pure duty and particular duties in much the way that morality and happiness were
   combined, except that happiness lay outside moral consciousness, while duties, both pure
   and determinate, can only lie within it. Determinate duties are necessary, since the agent
   must eventually opt for one of them. Therefore a god in whose consciousness they lie is a
   necessity of moral thinking.

¶607. 1. Consciousness has to do something if it is to fulfil its pure duty. At first the problem
   was that in doing so, it was likely to override other valid determinate duties. Now the
   problem is that it does not know what its pure duty is. Only God knows that. So pure duty
   lies in God, not in itself. The determinate duties which consciousness performs now lie in
   consciousness itself. This is thus a reversal of the position in ¶606.
¶609. 1. However imperfect its actions, the moral consciousness still postulates perfect conform-
   ity to duty in its thought. It thinks of its imperfection as counting as perfect in the eyes of God,
   who values knowing and willing, rather than action, and rewards it accordingly with happiness.
¶610. 1. In the real world pure duty and actuality are at odds with each other. Hence in ¶606,
   determinate duties were located in God, while the moral agent retained only pure duty. In
   ¶607, this position was reversed: pure duty went to God, while the moral agent retained
   determinate duties. Ideally they should go together in harmony. So consciousness projects
   its moral ideal of a perfect harmony between its actions and pure duty onto God. The world
   of morality is only a representation, in which imperfect actuality is enhanced to perfection.
   For an insightful, if controversial interpretation of this and the immediately preceding ¶¶,
   see Stern (2002), pp.172–5.
¶611. 1. Like faith in ¶529, moral consciousness thinks, but does not think conceptually and
   therefore lapses into representation. It does not connect up conceptually the opposed
   moments, morality and nature, and duty and actuality, but remains enclosed in thinking
   and therefore lets the content go free as an imaginary god, who is relied on to do all the hard
   work of ensuring that everything turns out for the best. It is split between pure thinking and
   actuality and does not know how to integrate them. What is needed is thinking of a higher
   order, that reflects on its own          first-order thinking.
¶612. 1. The moral consciousness was presupposed in ¶601. Moral consciousness’s ideal is the
   complete conformity of the world with morality. It considers this state of affairs as the final
   purpose or end of the world. However, it projects this ideal outside itself into the remote
   future. Until this purpose is attained actuality remains out of accord with morality. This casts
   doubt on our earlier assumption that there really is such a thing as moral consciousness.
¶614. 1. It is one Self, not two, one devoted only to duty, the other aware only of imperfect
   actuality. So in itself, or in principle, the Self is a unity of duty and actuality. But since it is
   admittedly unable to put this unity into practice, it projects it into the Beyond, as something
   that only     ought to be.
¶615. 1. In ¶615 the seemingly conflicting propositions of ¶601 and ¶614 are put together in a
   ‘synthetic’    unity, i.e. an artificial unity that does not result from conceptual analysis. Duty
   and actuality are independent of each other, yet geared to each other. So in representation
   each can pass as the other.
b. Shifting
¶616. 1. Consciousness has an ambivalent relationship with the moral world as it has pre-
   sented it in its postulates. On the one hand, it has created this world and is aware of having
   done so. On the other hand, it has placed this world beyond itself, even though it came
   about through and for self-consciousness.
      I have borrowed the word ‘shifting’ from Kainz (1994) to translate Verstellung, which
   means     ‘dissimulation, dissemblance’, but comes from the verb verstellen,                        ‘to move objects
   thought of as standing’, and sich verstellen, ‘to dissimulate’ (Farrell, 1977, p.225), and so also
   suggests    ‘shifting, displacing’. The verb ‘shift’ is similarly ambiguous.
¶617. 1. In CPR, B637, Kant calls the cosmological proof                              ‘a whole nest of dialectical
   presumptions’.
        2. Kant’s description of the cosmological proof as                  ‘a whole nest of dialectical presump-
   tions’   applies equally to his own moral world-view. It deals with its contradictions by
---
                                                                                                   

    hopping from one foot to the other. First it sets up one limb of the contradiction, treating it as
    all-important. Then it forgets this aspect and presents it as merely a disguise for the other
    limb. Then it goes back to the first limb again. It is fully aware of what it is up to. It does it only
    to avoid a confrontation with actuality and to save its contradictory position from collapse.
¶618. 1. Suppose that I perform a moral act, such as repaying a debt. Before I act, morality and
    external nature are not in accord, since the debt is unredeemed, but in repaying the debt
    I bring them into harmony. I am aware of this and gain my happiness in surveying the result
    of my action. What need is there then for a postulated harmony of morality and nature? It is
    perhaps needed before I act. I would not act at all, if I were not convinced of my ability to
    bring morality and nature into accord. But once I act, I produce this accord myself. There is
    no reason at all for projecting this harmony into the remote Beyond. (This objection assumes
    that the happiness in question is simply the happiness I gain from seeing the achievement of
    my immediate purpose. If Kant were to reply that what he had in mind was a more extensive
    overall happiness of the agent, Hegel can respond that this conflicts with our assumption that
    there is such a thing as moral consciousness (cf. ¶601): if I need to be motivated to repay my
    debts by the prospect of overall happiness, then I am not purely moral.)
¶619. 1. An action is singular, while the end is universal, the moral perfection of the world—to
    which my contribution is negligible. But to say this is to fail to take duty seriously; a single
    moral action is pure duty, and it does not matter to it what the rest of the world gets up to.
    We then shift to a different interpretation of the postulate, that it concerns not the single
    dutiful act, but the imperfection of nature, which goes its own way, but should conform to
    the moral law. However, this move really spells the end of morality. If nature and morality
    were in complete accord, why should we bother to do our duty rather than sit back and let
    God do all the work?
¶620. 1. If the highest good is realized, moral action is superfluous, even an interference with
    the ‘ethical law’      (Sittengesetz—Hegel’s use of this term rather than ‘moral law’ marks an
    intrusion of his own non-Kantian view). It is not obvious that Hegel’s objection is sound.
    If the harmony of nature and morality is a future prospect, especially a prospect to be
    attained only at infinity, moral actions will still be required for the foreseeable future.
    Even if, e.g., charitable acts are motivated by the prospect of the ultimate elimination of
    poverty—which would make charitable acts superfluous, that does not remove the point
    of charitable acts now, since charitable acts are needed in order to bring about the
    elimination of poverty. In any case, there would, even in a perfect world, still be a need
    for some moral acts; their performance would be part of what is involved in the world’s
    perfection. Hegel might reply that if we take duty seriously, then we shouldn’t worry about
    or be inspired, let alone motivated, by the ultimate state of the world: it is irrelevant to action
    here and now.
¶621. 1. Even if it were the case that in a perfect world all moral action, and not only charitable
    acts, would be superfluous, there is no obvious contradiction in claiming that moral actions
    are only a means to the realization of a state of affairs in which moral action is superfluous.
    There are, however, two problems with it. First, could Kant concede that actions performed
    in this spirit are really moral actions? Secondly, in what does the goodness of the highest
    good consist, if not in moral actions? (Even secular revolutionaries have difficulty in saying
    what is so good about their ideal society, once the need for revolutionary activity has
    disappeared.)
¶622. 1. Kant’s second postulate concerned the conflict between duty and sensibility and its
    eventual reconciliation. Hegel raises two difficulties. First, whereas Kant (like Plato) distin-
    guished sharply between our inclinations and urges, on the one hand, and our rational
    motivation to duty one the other, Hegel (like Aristotle) does not. He believes that dutiful
    action requires the power of inclinations for its performance. In Hegel’s view, our
---
      

   inclinations need to be refined rather than suppressed or eliminated, since without them we
   would do nothing at all. (Whether this is true is a moot point. One might eat out of duty
   even if one never felt hungry, e.g. to please one’s host or to stay alive. But it is less clear
   whether one could be motivated to do anything by reason alone, if one had no desires
   whatsoever.) Secondly, if inclinations were eliminated or harmonized with reason, morality
   would lose its point, since (on Kant’s view, but not Hegel’s) it essentially involves a struggle
   against recalcitrant inclinations. Someone with paedophiliac urges (such as Thomas Mann)
   can display great moral merit by resisting them, while someone who is free of them cannot.
   Kant resolves these problems by postponing the reconciliation to infinity.
¶623. 1. What Kant wants is the intermediate state of moral progress. But that will not do
   either, since it implies that one is getting morally better, or rather morally worse, since one is
   advancing towards a state in which morality will be eliminated. However, for Kant (like the
   Stoics, but unlike Hegel—despite his denigration of quantity) morality is an all or nothing
   matter. Morality is indivisible: it depends on the pure will alone, and once this succumbs to
   temptation, it has failed completely, whether one is a serial killer or merely a liar. (Kant says
   that murderers should be hung, but he really has no idea whether they have a good will or not.)
¶624. 1. Morality is always incomplete, or perhaps non-existent. So the demand for happiness
   in ¶602 is really unrelated to morality. Morality is unmasked as a demand for happiness
   regardless of one’s moral merit.
¶625. 1. The complaint that morality often fares badly and immorality well is just an expres-
   sion of envy disguised as morality. Since there is no such thing as perfect morality, and not
   even degrees of morality and immorality, happiness cannot possibly be distributed accord-
   ing to desert. It is just a matter of luck. We should try to spread it as widely as possible.
¶626. 1. Given the imperfection of human morality, the imperfect moral consciousness
   ascribes perfect morality to God. In trying to resolve the conflict between pure duty and
   specific duties, it shunted off first specific duties, and then pure duty, onto God. This is a
   dereliction of its own moral responsibility. Moral consciousness is autonomous. Nothing is
   sacrosanct for it unless it sanctifies it itself. It cannot expect God to do its work for it.
¶627. 1. God was postulated in order to accommodate specific duties. But pure duty must be
   transferred to Him too. The human will is subject to sensory temptations, so prone to evil, and
   also limited in its knowledge, so prone to error. Hence pure morality can only be found in God.
¶628. 1. However, God cannot struggle against sensibility, as we do, nor can he simply
   succumb to it, as we sometimes do, since that implies imperfection. So He must be entirely
   free of it. But such a conflict-free robotic state is not morality at all.
¶629. 1. This artificial representation of God, and the conceptually unconnected Also’s
   (cf. ¶¶113ff. on perception) are simply makeshift expedients to stave off overt contradiction
   and they have now run out.
¶630. 1. There are two moral consciousnesses, one human and one divine. The human one
   recognizes its imperfection: its morality is a                 figment of thought and not carried out. It
   therefore projects morality into the divine consciousness, where it sees a morality that is
   both that of a consciousness and is actually put into practice. But to do that the divine
   consciousness has to have within it nature and sensibility, i.e. precisely what, in the human
   case, was regarded as detrimental to morality. The moral world-view keeps shifting its
   position. Morality is first supposed to be valid as a construction of thought, then this validity
   is withdrawn. It is first supposed to be essentially opposed to concrete reality and free of it,
   then it is united with reality.
¶631. 1. Nature is regarded both as necessary for duty and as inessential. Duty, and knowledge
   of it, are located both in consciousness only and only in the Beyond. There is an uneasy
   relationship between the Self and the in-itself, pure morality. Does morality lie within the
   Self or in the transcendent Beyond? The moral world-view keeps shifting from one position

                                                                                                         

    to the other. Aware of this hypocrisy, consciousness now retreats into itself, discards all
    these fanciful representations, and becomes                   conscience, certain of itself and       finding its
    fulfilment in immediate conscientious action. This will not solve the problem, however.
    Moral self-consciousness developed its reality by all this shifting, and carries it along with it
    into its inner retreat. All it has achieved is consciousness of its own duplicity, not integrity.
    Its contempt for shifting is sheer hypocrisy.

c. Conscience. The beautiful soul, evil and its forgiveness
¶632. 1. Moral consciousness projected itself beyond itself, whether as pure duty or as
    actuality. This was the moralism of Kant and Fichte. Now this becomes, in the hands of
    the German Romantics, an aesthetic or religious world-view rather than a moral one. It
    begins with conscience, which reconciles the antinomies of reason and sensibility, duty and
    inclination, and so on. This in turn becomes the beautiful soul, which is self-certain but
    ineffectual. Finally, in evil and its forgiveness Hegel develops his own reconciliation of the
    tension between the singular and the universal, which troubled the earlier views.
¶633. 1.    Gewissen, ‘conscience’, is closely related to gewiss, ‘certain’. Each of the three main
    stages of spirit—the ethical world, culture, and morality—culminates in an all-important
    Self: (1) the person of the Roman Empire, the empty instantiation of an undifferentiated
    universal, in a world containing nothing but bare Selves; (2) the Self of the French
    revolution, in which the singular and the universal come apart, but the ethereal universal
    will cannot establish a stable social order; and (3) the Self that has emerged from moral
    consciousness. This Self has overcome the oscillation between singularity and universality
    that characterized moral consciousness, has reconciled this dualism, and has, owing to its
    development, acquired a content for duty and established its presence in the world.
¶634. 1. The Self of conscience sublates the separations that plagued moral consciousness, and
    is now concrete and unified moral spirit. It does not apply some abstract standard to its
    decisions. It takes no account of pure duty and nature or sensibility. It simply does what
    seems to it the right thing to do in the circumstances.
¶635. 1. Conscience does not worry about a possible discrepancy between its knowledge of a
    given situation and the situation as it actually is. All that matters is the situation as
    consciousness knows, or believes, it to be. Conscience is certain of its duty when it acts. It
    is not troubled by ifs and buts, like those that made the previous moral consciousness unable
    to act. Like sensory certainty in ¶¶90ff., it immediately knows the content of the situation
    from the interest it has in it and converts it into the form of duty. It does not serve as a
    universal medium (cf. ¶113 on perception) embracing all the specific conflicting duties into
    which a situation might be split up and which would paralyse the agent or force him to
    violate one of them. It focuses single-mindedly and exclusively on what is right. In any
    situation there are always reasons for doing different things if we analyse it. But action
    requires immediacy:         ‘Here I stand. I cannot do otherwise’ (Luther).
¶637. 1. The gulf between duty and reality that Kant opens up makes action, or at least moral
    action, impossible. Hyppolite II, p.173, n.64, compares Hegel’s praise of F.H. Jacobi
    (1743–1819), who replaced Kant’s moral law with certainty of what a particular situation
    requires. See Hegel (1977), pp.143–50. One might do what one regards as the right thing to
    do in a situation without believing that one’s so regarding it entails that it is right. But not
    only is conscience immediately certain of itself. It is also aware that it is, and regards its self-
    certainty as what really matters and as the conclusive justification of its act. This is its
    conviction. It has the effect of making one’s own individual Self, to the exclusion of others,
    into the content of the action.
¶638. 1. Moral consciousness did take account of itself, but only insofar as it conformed to an
    objective standard, viz. pure duty. Conscience, by contrast, focuses exclusively on its own
---
      

   Self. The contradiction between the Self and reality has been resolved, because all that
   matters now is the Self, which negates everything else. It is pure knowing, as the moral
   consciousness was, and also knowledge of the content, since the content is supplied by its
   singular consciousness. These two types of knowledge can no longer diverge. The Self no
   longer has any tendency to go its own way regardless of what really matters. The Self alone is
   the   final authority on what is right.
¶639. 1. Duty no longer confronts the Self as something about which it might be mistaken. So
   what the Self does out of conviction is not just what it believes to be its duty, not even just
   this Self ’s duty; it is duty simpliciter, and thus the in-itself. However, this duty also detaches
   itself from the Self that conscientiously performs it, insofar as it is no longer the private
   possession of the Self but displays itself to other Selves. This Being-for-another is an
   essential feature of consciousness. What it is and does also has a public presence.
¶640. 1. We are to assume that the other Selves to which the conscientious Self displays its
   action are also conscientious Selves. They therefore recognize his action not only as an act of
   a particular type, such as repaying a debt, but also as an action inspired by conviction. They
   believe that, given his conviction, the Self did the right thing in the circumstances, even if
   they, in the same circumstances, would have acted otherwise from their own conviction.
   A Kantian moral consciousness cannot have such recognition, since it cannot be sure that it
   has done its duty. But the conscientious Self has done its duty, by simply transposing its
   dutiful content into reality. We can no longer say that good intentions go awry or that the
   good fare badly. The Self has done its duty and gained recognition for it, and that is all that
   matters. This all depends on taking the action together with the Self and its content. Taken
   on its own, the action is negligible. But now all the relevant factors—substantiality, external
   reality, and thought—are integrated into the Self.
¶641. 1. The reference is to chapter V, ¶¶394ff., esp. ¶¶412–18. For the honest consciousness
   the Thing itself, what really matters, lacked intrinsic content and was applied as a predicate
   to anything whatsoever. Its content was gradually enriched as spirit progressed. In Greece it
   was the social substance of State and family; in culture it was the external world of power
   and wealth; in morality it was thinking about pure duty. But now it is the subject, and
   embraces all these other factors: substantiality, external reality, and thought. Conscience has
   them all in its control.
¶642. 1. In order to act dutifully conscience needs to know about the situation in which it acts.
   The acquisition of such knowledge is essentially required by conscientiousness. Strictly
   speaking, it should know everything about its situation. But it could only do this if its
   situation were within its own consciousness, not, as it is, an objective situation of infinite
   complexity. So in practice it has to stop somewhere and content itself with incomplete
   knowledge. However, it is up to conscience itself to decide how much investigation it needs
   to undertake. Others may know, or want to know, more than it does. But that is their
   business. For conscience itself its limited knowledge is complete, since it has decided that it
   is all that duty requires.
¶643. 1. Like the moral consciousness, conscience is faced with a variety of specific duties
   implicit in its situation. None of them is sacrosanct, only pure duty, which has now turned
   into the pure conviction of duty. This conviction has no intrinsic content, but a content
   must be found for it, so that action can take place. None of the general moral considerations
   that figured in previous shapes of consciousness has any authority for it. To accept them
   would impair the autonomy of the conscientious Self. So all it has to fall back on is its own
   sensibility, its urges, and inclinations. The conscientious Self thus ends up as an arbitrary
   and wilful singular Self. On this line of argument, cf. Wolff (1970).
¶644. 1. On law-testing, see ¶¶429ff. Pure duty is empty and can accommodate any content
   whatsoever. The morality or immorality of the action does not depend on any of its
---
                                                                                               

    objective features, but solely on the strength of the agent’s conviction. Others may condemn
    the action as fraudulent, violent, or cowardly. But as long as these others, along with the
    agent himself, adhere to the morality of conscience, these charges have no force. They must
    recognize the agent as conscientious and dutiful.
¶645. 1. Any content inserted into the empty frame of pure duty will be as determinate and
    exclusive as any other. There is no conclusive reason for preferring one content to another.
    In particular there is no reason for preferring the universal interest to one’s own. Morality in
    general, in contrast to ethics, is averse to any law that presents itself as authoritative in
    opposition to the conviction and interests of the individual. It treats such a law as just
    something to be taken into consideration alongside other factors. Utilitarianism is no use
    either. It is anybody’s guess how the calculations would turn out, even if conscience were
    willing to engage in calculation.
¶646. 1. The conscientious Self is both for itself and in itself. It accepts nothing else as in itself.
    So it does not worry about universal knowing, whether complete knowledge of this
    particular case or general laws applying to all cases of its type. All that matters is the
    information it has available about its particular situation. This is enough to make it all-
    powerful. It is less like Kant’s moral consciousness, and more like Kant’s god. It is not
    simply singular any longer. It is selfhood (Selbstheit) rather than just a Self.
¶647. 1. The conscientious act is out in the open and on display to other conscientious agents.
    It is an immediate physical presence, but also the act of one Self among a community of
    Selves. The action is recognized by others not as an act in conformity with a law, but as an
    act inspired by conviction of duty.
¶648. 1. Others recognize the agent as a conscientious Self, but they may not recognize the act
    as rightful. The act is determinate in a way that the conscientious Self is not. The Self might
    have performed any one of indefinitely many other acts instead; its potentiality is not
    exhausted by this particular act. This affects the response to the act not only of other Selves,
    but of the agent himself. He is a free self-consciousness and not bound to endorse his own
    previous action. Others take him to be committed to the rightness of his action. But he is
    not; he can survey his action critically from the outside just as others can. He has shifted
    from the position that others take him to occupy. Conscience does not involve long-term
    commitment. To take an analogy from the spiritual animal kingdom (¶¶397ff.)—which
    Hegel clearly has in mind here—an author, when his writing is going smoothly, is totally
    committed to and absorbed in what he writes; he cannot think of it as just one of indefinitely
    many things he could write. But once it is published, he may well think of it in this way,
    approaching what he wrote with a distant critical eye, just as others do; he becomes
    universal selfhood rather than this particular Self. He may be disturbed, or amused, if
    others continue to link him indissolubly with his previous pronouncements. There is more
    to people than their acts and utterances; they are harder to pin down. ‘My favourite book is
    my next one. I’m always hoping to make my next book my best one’ (Mo Willems).
¶650. 1. What calls for recognition is not the external action, but the action together with the
    agent’s conviction of it as his duty. Without this conviction it seems to express only the
    agent’s preference. What ought to appear in public is the conviction itself, the agent’s
    knowledge of his duty. But an action alone cannot express this.
¶651. 1. What now enters the public scene is not just the ephemeral, determinate action, but
    the very Self, self-consciousness, recognized by other self-consciousnesses. Action alone
    cannot achieve this. Action is ambiguous and does not express the Self as a whole in all its
    elusive indeterminacy.
¶652. 1. Ever since sensory certainty in ¶¶90ff., language has played a crucial role in PS, and
    especially in culture: see ¶¶508ff. Language presents the pure ego to itself and also to others,
    overcoming its isolation while preserving its unique individuality. It is only a Self in virtue of
---
      

    hearing itself and being heard by others of its kind. (Like many philosophers of the time,
    Hegel paid little attention to the blind and to deaf mutes. One of the few exceptions was
    Diderot (1916).)
¶653. 1. Language here differs from its predecessors. It is not perverted and perverting, as in
    ¶520. It is not a language of law, command, and complaint, as in Greek tragedy. Nor is it
    mute, like the moral consciousness, which cannot express itself in public reality. Conscience
    comes entirely clean and assures everyone of its conviction and that its conviction is what
    matters. Hyppolite, II, p.184, n.84, refers to Rousseau’s Confessions.
¶654. 1. The Self can now have no reason for concealing its real intention, since whatever its
    intention is counts as right. Dutifulness requires no particular intention, only that the agent
    should say what its intention is, and affirm its conviction of its rectitude. If he says he is
    acting conscientiously, then he is. In asserting this, he becomes a universal Self, one among
    many equally universal and mutually recognizing Selves. The content of his deed is specific,
    not universal. But this does not matter. What matters is his self-declared formal kinship
    with all other Selves as conscientious agents.
¶655. 1. Here conscience has become the ‘beautiful soul’, which preserves and contemplates
    its own unrestricted universality and resists doing anything that would limit it. Rousseau,
    Schiller, and Goethe contributed to the development of the idea, but Hegel has Novalis
    (1772–1801) mainly in mind. See Hegel (1948), pp.234–7 and PR ¶140, esp. its concluding
    reference to PS. On Hegel’s dim view of genius, see also PS ¶¶51, 68, and 70.
¶656. 1. The community in question may be that of the Moravian Church, or the idea of a
    community later proposed by an associate of the romantics, Friedrich Schleiermacher
    (1768–1834), who was early on associated with the Moravians but soon broke away. On
    Schleiermacher, see Hegel (1977), pp.151f. Conscience goes through two stages. In the first,
    there is still a difference between the Self and its abstract consciousness directed on the
    essence; the mediation of the relation between them by a third term guarantees their
    difference. In the second, this difference disappears in all-embracing self-consciousness,
    since the mediation has gone. The Self has become united with God. This clearly refers to
    Novalis. (Novalis’s father was also a Moravian.)
¶657. 1.    ‘I=I’ is a formula especially associated with Fichte, referring to the bare ego stripped of
    all determinate features. Novalis was a close student of Fichte and appropriated him for
    romanticism: see Novalis (2003).
¶658. 1. The beautiful soul is entirely self-absorbed. Its object, God, has become identical with
    itself and perfectly transparent to it: its consciousness of this object is just its knowledge of
    itself. The beautiful soul is similar to the unhappy consciousness: see ¶¶206ff. It too is in
    dialogue with itself, but now the dialogue is explicitly internal, not a dialogue with a
    supposedly external object. Moreover, the original unhappy consciousness was only impli-
    citly reason and lacked the conceptual resources available to the beautiful soul. The beautiful
    soul is averse to all external reality and fears to sully its purity with any commitment to
    action: cf. ¶32 for an implicit reference to Novalis. In the course of spirit’s development, the
    Self became increasingly important. But now the Self seems to have dwindled away, as
    symbolized by Novalis’s early death. The beautiful soul looks like a dead-end.
¶659. 1. Hegel returns to an earlier point in the development of conscience before it branched
    off into the cul-de-sac of the beautiful soul: see e.g. ¶¶634ff, where conscience gets into
    action. In ¶648, we drew a distinction between the universal consciousness, the mutually
    recognizing conscientious Selves, and the single Self, but this had disappeared by ¶654,
    when all that mattered was the single Self. Now we have to reconsider the relationship
    between universality and singularity. The individual may well be contemptuous of the
    general view of where its duty lies, regarding pure duty as a sham and something one
---
                                                                                                            

    does only to gain the respect of others. Why should he do what everyone else thinks he
    ought to do? Why not be a free rider? He is entirely free of any particular duty, and can
    decide for himself what to do, regardless of what other Selves think about it.
¶660. 1. In ¶659 the opposition between individual agent and the universality he flouts lay in
    his own mind, but it now emerges as his opposition to another individual, who represents
    universality. For the first individual, universality is a minor consideration in comparison
    with his own Self. For the second, duty or the universal far outweighs the individual. So he
    regards the      first as evil, because he does not conform to the universal, and also as
    hypocritical, because he appeals to his conformity to himself (‘to thine own Self be true’),
    equating this with duty and conscientiousness.
¶661. 1. The dissident agent claims to be good, but is internally evil. To unmask the hypocrisy,
    his universal opponent must bring his evil out into the open. As de La Rochefoucauld said,
    ‘hypocrisy is the homage that vice renders to virtue’. This makes hypocrisy sound rather a
    good thing, suggesting that, internally, the dissident is not so evil after all. But that is not so.
    Hypocrisy is not simply paying homage to virtue. It does not believe its own tribute to
    virtue, but shows its contempt for virtue by using it only to fool others and, in fact, degrades
    virtue in the eyes of others by showing that it can be exploited in this way.
¶662. 1. The dispute cannot be resolved by a stubborn dissident. Suppose he insists that he
    is not evil and at odds with the universal, but conforming to his inner law; the other may
    not believe that he is acting in this spirit or that, even if he is, this removes the evil.
    Suppose, alternatively, that the dissident agrees that he is evil because he does follow his
    internal law, and inevitably an internal law of one’s own can only be singular and wilful.
    Then there is no hypocrisy. But he is saying that he does mistreat others, by acting
    towards them in accordance with a law that they do not recognize. In fact, however,
    dissidents are rarely, if ever, so persistent in their opposition to standard morality.
    They aspire to operate within accepted moral discourse and to get others to recognize
    their case.
¶663. 1. Nor can the universal moralist settle the dispute. He appeals to his law, just as the
    dissident does. Since the two laws oppose each other, each is particular rather than
    universal. The dissident’s law is as legitimate as his own. Neither of them is universally
    recognized, so each has an equal right. Things might have been different if the moralist had
    simply followed its own universal law. It is in condemning the dissident that it exposes its
    own weakness and the other’s strength.
¶664. 1. The judging consciousness turns out to be as evil and hypocritical as the dissident. It
    talks instead of acting, and it interprets the dissident’s action as evil, when it should try to
    unearth the universality that it also contains. The agent’s intuition of itself in the judging
    consciousness looks ahead to ¶666.
¶665. 1. Judging is also an action of sorts and can be assessed as such. It cannot deny that the
    agent has done his duty, since almost anything can be a duty. But no one ever acts solely
    for the sake of duty. He always has self-interested motives as well. This must be so, since it
    is the act of an individual and an individual has interests, which must therefore figure
    among his motives for action. (This argument is questionable: it might be taken to imply
    that if I am hungry when I repay a debt, I must be motivated partly by a desire to satisfy my
    hunger.) The judging consciousness focuses exclusively on the self-interested motive, ambi-
    tion, etc., and ignores the dutiful aspect. It wants to reduce dutiful acts to self-interested acts,
    which applies to its own act of judging as well. The dictum                   ‘No man is a hero to his valet’ is
    usually attributed to the Duke of Condé in the reign of Louis XIV. Hegel makes his addition
    for the   first time here. Goethe repeated it ten years later, but Hegel reminds us, in PH, p.32,
    that he said it first.

¶666. 1. The two consciousnesses are now on an equal footing. The agent’s confession is
   intended to be reciprocated and a                first step to mutual recognition. Speech is not just a
   substitute for action. It is a significant action.
¶667. 1. The first occurrence of ‘admission’ translates Geständnis, and the second Eingeständ-
   nis, while    ‘confession’     translates   Bekenntnis. According to Jarczyk and Labarrière I, p.797,
   n.448, Bekenntnis         has a religious flavour that the other two words lack. Hence Hegel’s
   vocabulary becomes more religious as the ¶ proceeds. This culminates in the traditional
   Christian doctrine that the spirit can pardon any act and make a sinner reborn.
¶668. 1. There are now two directions in which the judging consciousness might go. In the
   first it becomes a beautiful soul, unable to bring itself to descend to the level of the dissident
   and engage with it on its own terms. It is driven mad by the unmediated opposition between
   its own moral purity and the need to enter into the public realm, loses its grip on itself, and
   dwindles away. This results in an equalization of the two parties, but not a very fruitful one.
¶669. 1. The second direction is more fruitful. The judging consciousness confesses and
   thereby abandons its particular position and rises to universality. The defects of its deed
   are annulled by spirit: cf. ¶667. The acting, dissident consciousness and the judging
   consciousness are both equally involved in action. The evil, acting consciousness confessed,
   because it could see the other’s point of view, and now the judging consciousness must
   reciprocate. Action and the concept opposed to it, and for that reason determinate, both
   succumb to the all-embracing spirit.
¶670. 1. The judging consciousness renounces the thought that divides the two sides, because,
   like the dissident in ¶667, it recognizes itself in the other, who has now shed his singularity
   and withdrawn from his action. Each party renounces its previous oppositional stance and
   takes on board the other’s position. The judging consciousness now regards its formerly evil
   opponent as good, or, rather, it abandons this distinction altogether. The two sides are
   reconciled in all-encompassing spirit, which embraces both knowledge of the universal
   essence and knowledge of the individual Self.
¶671. 1. Before passing on to religion, Hegel here sketches the prospect of a post-revolutionary
   State that will embody both objective institutions and subjective morality. (At the end of PR
   ¶140, he makes a transition from morality to ethical life, but not (as he notes) to religion.
   Enc. III, ¶512 makes a similar transition from morality to ethical life.) The reconciliation of
   the two sides is not easy, since they seem utterly opposed. The two sides, the insistence on
   the objective ethical order and the insistence on the primacy of the individual Self, have
   reached their highest pitch. In fact, each side involves a Self, the universal Self attached to
   the objective order and the individual Self appealing to its own conscience and self-interest.
   Each of these Selves seems entirely coherent and self-contained, in need of no supplement
   from the other. Thus each is in a way universal, determinate only in virtue of its opposition
   to the other. If people fell into two distinct impermeable types, universalist Selves and
   individualist Selves, then a reconciliation between them might be impossible. But as we have
   seen in ¶670, this is not the case. Each type of Self intuits itself in the other, i.e. sees an aspect
   of itself in the other and appreciates the other’s point of view. Fichte’s formula,                      ‘I=I’, can be
   seen as expressing this divergence between two types of Self, one universal, the other
   singular, within each individual Self, albeit with different strengths. Thus in order to become
   fully self-conscious and unite these two strands of itself, the individual needs to dismount
   from its high horse and recognize that individuals who are predominantly, though not
   exclusively, of a different type from itself, also have a case. God Himself is such a union of
   universality and singularity. So He has a special role to play in a society of this sort. (As
   often, Hegel uses Diskretion and indiskrete in their original senses of ‘discreteness, separ-
   ation’ and ‘indiscrete, unseparated’, rather than ‘discreetness, circumspection’ and ‘indis-
   creet, imprudent’.)

(CC.) Religion
VII. Religion
¶672. 1. We have looked at spirit. Now we turn to the self-consciousness of spirit: religion. In
    the accounts of unhappy consciousness (see ¶211) and of faith (see ¶¶487 and 528), absolute
    essence was explicitly viewed through the eyes of a consciousness distinct from it, not as it is
    in and for itself. But religion proper is concerned with the absolute essence as the self-
    consciousness of spirit. Hyppolite, II, p.204, notes that Hegel himself seems rather to give a
    phenomenology         of religion, an account of God or gods as seen through the eyes of the
    religious community. Hegel himself believes that God is not distinct from human beings,
    and that they are an essential aspect of Him. It is only human worshippers who make the
    absolute essence for itself, as well as in itself. Hence the mistake of the religions considered
    earlier, or perhaps of the accounts of them, was to separate God from humans.
¶673. 1. The understanding in chapter III delved beneath external reality to find its super-
    sensible interior, but it found only a universal, not a Self, which is what is required for the
    self-consciousness of spirit, not just universal laws. The unhappy consciousness could not
    connect up itself and God. Reason sought itself in immediate reality, when religion requires
    a mediated approach to it.
¶674. 1. There was a religion in Greece (see ¶¶444ff.), involving impersonal fate and the
    Eumenides (i.e. Furies or Erinyes, the avenging goddesses of ¶462) of the dead Self, but the
    Self and fate were not united, resulting in an unsatisfactory Self and an unsatisfactory god.
    Hegel expands his account of Greek religion in ¶¶699ff., esp. 727ff., where this unity is
    gradually realized.
¶675. 1. In faith (¶¶527ff.) the Self did unite with universality in death, and the supersensible
    realm of chapter III was revived. But since faith’s thought was unconceptual, it succumbed
    to the onslaught of enlightenment. The enlightenment found all the satisfaction it needed in
    this world and its god, insofar it acknowledged one, remained an empty cipher.
¶676. 1. In Kant’s moral religion, God is given a positive content, but tempered by the
    scepticism of the enlightenment. The content is both taken back into the Self and continu-
    ally escapes the Self, because it keeps being withdrawn, especially by being postponed to
    infinity. Nevertheless the result of this tergiversation is a Self that combines divinity with
    reality, giving a god who is present in this world, not in the Beyond: see ¶671.
¶677. 1. The shapes of spirit considered so far, those of Greece, culture, and morality, were
    only spirit’s consciousness, not its self-consciousness: it was conscious of the world it faced,
    but did not recognize spirit itself in it. That changes, however, when spirit takes the form of
    conscience. As conscience it does not leave the objective world outside it, but incorporates it
    lock, stock, and barrel, so that its consciousness of the world amounts to its consciousness of
    itself. Spirit now has before it a model of itself as embracing all reality, though this reality is
    not conceived as independent, but as simply at its beck and call. Admittedly, this model of
    spirit is still only an object of spirit and an object in a specific shape. But as essentially self-
    consciousness, religion can see through this shape to the idea behind it. In the form of
    conscience, spirit embraces all actuality, but only in thought, only in the way in which the
    expression      ‘all actuality’    contains all actuality: actuality is not yet              ‘in the form of free
    actuality or of nature appearing as independent’.
¶678. 1. Because of its origin in conscience, religion does not allow the world of which spirit is
    conscious to be free and independent. This world still exists independently, however, and
    since religion does not accommodate it, it falls outside religion. So spirit divides into two
    separate compartments, religion and worldly life. At bottom these are the same. So they
    must be harmonized with each other. This requires a move in two directions. Worldly
    actuality must be elevated so that religion can accommodate it, and religion must descend
---
      

   into worldly actuality. Religion does make use of worldly actuality as a symbolic represen-
   tation of itself. But this demeans both religion and actuality. Self-conscious spirit, religion,
   should appear as it really is, not in some specific sensory object and, conversely, worldly
   actuality should be acknowledged as independent, not just as trappings of religion. Para-
   doxically, when God and the world become independent of each other and are completed
   within themselves, they will be in harmony with each other under the aegis of a single spirit,
   all-encompassing absolute spirit.
¶679. 1. Worldly spirit involves all five ‘configurations’ (Gestaltungen) considered so far, from
   consciousness in chapters I–III to spirit (in a narrower sense) in chapter VI, not yet divided
   into ‘shapes’ (Gestalten) such as sensory certainty. These configurations are not successive
   in time, only in their logical order. But the whole spirit, i.e. spirit in chapter VI plus religion,
   is in time and its shapes are temporally successive. Moreover, although configurations are
   not successive in time, the specific shapes into which they divide, as consciousness divides
   into sensory certainty, perception, and understanding, are temporally successive. Thus, e.g.,
   the first stage of natural religion, the religion of light, involves both sensory certainty and the
   master and slave (¶¶685f.), because they belong to different configurations and can thus
   appear contemporaneously, but it could not involve also perception or Stoicism, since they
   are different shapes within the same configurations. The universal, temporal spirit is one
   term of a syllogism linking it with the singular temporal shapes, by way of the particular
   atemporal configurations.
¶680. 1. Like the development of worldly spirit, the development of religion is articulated into
   stages and sub-stages. The three main stages of religion are natural religion (pre-Greek
   religion), the religion of art (Greek religion), and revealed or manifest religion (Christian-
   ity). These correspond respectively to the configurations of consciousness (Being-in-itself ),
   self-consciousness (Being-for-itself ), and reason (Being-in-and-for-itself ). However, nat-
   ural religion and the religion of art, though not revealed religion, are each divided into three
   temporally successive sub-stages. For example, natural religion divides into the religion of
   light, that of plants and animals, and that of the artisan. The configuration of consciousness
   conveniently divides into three shapes, to which these correspond: sensory certainty,
   perception, and understanding. However, the specific correlation of religious shapes with
   the earlier course of PS becomes more perfunctory as the development of religion proceeds.
   There are too many non-religious shapes and not enough religions for there to be an exact
   correlation, and Christianity is too complex to submit to any such clear-cut categorization.
   Hence within limits a specific religion can take its pick among non-religious shapes,
   choosing the one that suits it best, but using others as well. The requirements of the
   integration of religion with worldly spirit helps to account for the double organization of
   PS. In one of Hegel’s arrangements, consciousness is divided into three separate chapters; in
   the other it is entitled      ‘A. Consciousness’ and constitutes the first of the three main sections
   of the work. In the           first of these arrangements, reason, spirit, religion, and absolute
   knowledge are each assigned separate chapters, while in the other they are combined as
   the third main section, the second being ‘B. Self-consciousness’. The treatment of con-
   sciousness as a single section better suits the significance now given it as a single configur-
   ation. The treatment of reason, etc. as a single section fits better Hegel’s idea that there are
   only three main types of religion. The architectonic to which Hegel aspires also accounts for
   his apparent omission of Judaism: but see my note to ¶720.
¶681. 1. In the original occurrence of a shape it had to develop itself, then withdraw into its
   substance, spirit. So we proceeded in a unilinear fashion. But now that this substance has
   come to light, the shapes are not isolated any more but all involved in spirit together.
   Originally the series of shapes was punctuated by nodes, which marked ‘reversions’                     (Rück-
   gänge), retreats, withdrawals, or returns of moments into their ground and essence or into
---
                                                                                                         

    the simple Self of spirit, the Self that is for-itself (¶443). But after noting them, we proceeded
    on our linear course. Now we can see how a node lies not just on one straight line, but is the
    centre of many lines linking it with other, similar, stages in PS. This implies that the various
    shapes are not parts, but attributes of the substance of worldly spirit (cf. ¶440) and, in
    religion, predicates of the subject: cf. ¶¶703, 748f., and 759. We have known all along that
    spirit implicitly involves all forms, but we had to present a particular spirit from its own
    point of view.
¶682. 1. In Christianity, spirit’s consciousness and self-consciousness are harmonized, but not
    in religion as it     first appears. Like sensory certainty in ¶90, it is immediate. Its aim is self-
    consciousness, but since it is conscious of spirit only immediately, it is conscious of it only in
    the shape of a natural entity. This natural entity is               filled, in accordance with the concept of
    religion, with spirit, etc., but its natural shape expresses this inadequately. That is, the
    concept of religion, for which the essence is self-consciousness, is not actualized. The
    object’s spiritual significance prevents it from becoming merely a natural entity. So it is
    still in the realm of religion. This defective immediate unity of spirit with itself is the basis on
    which consciousness splits into the two extremes of spiritual self-consciousness and a more
    or less inadequate expression of it. Spirit is here pure consciousness, so it does not create
    nature, but only various religious shapes in which spirit appears in its entirety, culminating
    in absolute spirit, where the two sides are              finally harmonized.
¶683. 1. As often in Hegel, the concept of something is its incipient stage, containing the plan
    of its later development: cf. ¶682. The Greek artist represents the Self and its doing in the
    formerly natural shape, transposing the Self into the object. Christianity puts the Self on
    both sides, both as the immediate Self of the worshipper and as a Self immediately
    represented by him. Here the shape is true, but shape and representation must be replaced
    by the ‘concept’, in a different sense from that in the first sentence: see ¶788.
A .  NATURAL RELIGION
¶684. 1. There are two aspects to a religion: first, its self-consciousness and, secondly, the
    determinate shape in which it is conscious of itself. We are here concerned only with this
    determinate shape. However, the difference between the two aspects depends on self-
    consciousness. For the shape is not raw, unthought nature nor pure thought. Its role in a
    religion and its spiritual significance depends entirely on self-conscious thought. Religions
    are differentiated by their different shapes. But a religion is not exhausted by its single
    determinacy. On the one hand, the different religions look like variations of one religion,
    since the representations distinctive of one religion occur in an inchoate form in every
    religion. (Cf. ¶2 on the way in which different philosophies can be viewed as different stages
    in the growth of a single philosophy: see also Enc. I, ¶13.) On the other hand, there is
    diversity of religion. The aim is to harmonize self-consciousness with consciousness, and we
    cannot suppose this to have been achieved simply because some religions happen to have
    incorporated in their shape the Self and God represented as self-consciousness, unless they
    were deliberately incorporated by self-consciousness and registered as essential by the elim-
    ination or demotion of lower determinations. For example, the occurrence of an incarnation
    in oriental religion is inconsequential, since oriental religion lacks the reconciliation signified
    by the incarnation. Revealed religion, viz. Christianity, does contain all the other shapes in it
    in a subordinate form, but that does not detract from its difference from them.

a. The light-essence
¶685. 1. Hegel presents the religion of ancient Persia, Zoroastrianism, as initially the sheer
    concept of religion, conscious of itself as all truth, etc., but shrouded in darkness, and
    needing to come out into the light by                   finding an adequate embodiment of itself. The
---
      

   emergence from darkness into light is the lowest common denominator of all religions,
   hence the appropriate starting-point. It is comparable to the pure I of ¶¶166ff., in search of
   an adequate embodiment of its self-certainty. Cf. Hegel (1895), II, pp.79ff.
¶686. 1. In conformity with the architectonic explained in ¶¶679–82 the religion of light
   corresponds to sensory certainty, the              first stage of spirit in the wide sense. It also involves
   mastery from the second configuration: spirit is a master urging self-consciousness to
   engage with its object. Hyppolite, II, p.215, n.8, suggests that this reflects Hegel’s belief
   that in oriental religions the absolute is the negation of the Self and appears as a master over
   man as a slave: the servile character of oriental social relations is transposed into religion.
   The thinking of Zoroastrianism lacks the                     understanding        that gives stability and clear
   definition both to thoughts and to things.
¶687. 1.    ‘Sideshow’ (Beiherspielen) is reminiscent of the ‘by-play’ (Beispiel) in sensory cer-
   tainty: see ¶92. The sun only rises, it does not set. If it were to set, it would pull substance
   together into a subject and a Self, arranging the whole show into an orderly system. Some
   attempt is made to combine unity with plurality by assigning many names to the single
   substance as its attributes. But there is no coherent account of the emergence of these
   attributes in the world.
¶688. 1. Some central focus is needed to bring order into this chaos. This is already implicit in
   the religion itself. Light, as a negative power dissolving all the variations in it, is at bottom a
   sort of Self, that now stabilizes the different entities without annihilating them.

b. The plant and the animal
¶689. 1. This refers to the early religions of India: see also Hegel (1895), II, pp.1ff. They
   correspond to perception, and its things with many properties. Spirit splits up into many
   spirits, like the properties of a thing. At first they coexist peacefully as a religion of flowers,
   but later it becomes a religion of animals, which                       fight with each other, rather as the
   properties of one thing opposes the properties of other things. The spirits inflict death on
   each other, just as, in an abstract way, material things do. In the actual, worldly spirit there
   were many dispersed tribes, each with its own totemic animal, fighting each other to the
   death: cf. the life and death struggle in ¶187.
¶690. 1. This transition is from India to Egypt: see Hegel (1895), II, pp.101ff. Egyptian religion
   corresponds, in the configuration of consciousness, to the understanding (¶¶132ff.) and, in
   that of self-consciousness, to the labour by which the bondsman cultivates himself (¶196).
   Thus the Self is producing itself, as much as it is the Self producing.                     ‘Immediate’      Being-in-
   itself and ‘abstract’      Being-for-itself are, respectively, the essence of light and the religion of
   animals. But these are now transformed into the material object on which the artisan works
   and the representation he produces in it.
c. The artisan
¶691. 1. The artisan does not start out with a clear conception of himself, but produces himself
   as an object, as did the bondsman in forming a thing. That is why he is an artisan rather
   than an artist.
¶692. 1. Initially the artisan’s products use the geometrical shapes congenial and intelligible to
   the understanding, straight lines rather than curves. Such structures have no intrinsic
   meaning. They can only accommodate the spiritual Self as a dead person, like the pyramids,
   or have an external relation to the Self, like the statue of Memnon at Luxor, which after
   being cracked by an earthquake in 27                , was reputed to ‘sing’, usually at dawn: see ¶695.
¶693. 1. The separation between the artisan’s material and his work on it from outside is like a
   separation of his body from his soul. He must bring them together by putting himself into
   his artefact and not remaining outside it. He does this by making a statue (the soul,
---
                                                                                               

    singularity), inside a temple (the body, universality). The statue and the temple are closer to
    each other than were the pyramid and the corpse. Moreover, the statue, even if it is a statue
    of a god, is somewhat like the artisan, and he sees himself in it. But it is still not the artisan
    himself. There is still a gulf between the active self-consciousness and its product.
¶694. 1. The columns of a temple are decorated with stylized plant-forms, introducing curves
    as well as straight lines.
¶695. 1. Previously the pyramid or other structure either contained only a corpse or, like the
    colossus of Memnon, pointed towards an external spirit: see ¶692. Now it contains a statue
    in the shape of an animal. The artisan is well aware that he is not just an animal. So the
    statue is like a hieroglyph, a pictorial symbol with a hidden meaning. To indicate this the
    artisan makes the statue half animal and half human. It still does not resemble a human Self.
    It does not speak a non-hieroglyphic language, and does not look as if it could. Hence even
    when it has no animality in it, like the colossus of Memnon, it needs the sunrise to make any
    sound at all, and then it is just noise, not language: ‘And from her lips, as morn from
    Memnon, drew/Rivers of melodies’ (Tennyson, ‘The Palace of Art’).
¶696. 1. The black stone is a cornerstone of the Kaaba, an ancient shrine in Mecca, venerated
    by Muslims, but also in pre-Islamic times. Hegel takes it to symbolize the human interior,
    which cannot be adequately expressed in sculpture.
¶697. 1. Both the statue and the black stone contain the inner and the outer Self, but disunited.
    To unite them the artisan combines natural and human shapes, as in the sphinx with a lion’s
    body and a human head. The sphinx is associated with wisdom and, in Greek mythology,
    with riddles: cf. ¶737.
¶698. 1. The conflict of ¶697 results in a statue whose external form adequately expresses the
    human interior. The artisan sees in his product a replica of himself, and thereby acquires a
    unitary conception of himself, which turns him from an instinctive artisan into a self-
    conscious artist. The conflict and its reconciliation is reminiscent of the struggle for
    recognition in chapter IV. Hegel may also be thinking of Pygmalion and Galatea.
B .  RELIGION OF ART
¶699. 1. Greek religion was closely associated with art. All Greek art before the death of
    Alexander in 323          had some connection with religion and, conversely, religion had no
    formal expression outside of art. The artisan has become properly self-conscious in virtue of
    the replica of himself he has produced.
¶700. 1. The religion of art corresponds to a society that embodies the ethical spirit. This spirit
    is the substance of all individuals, but it does not crush or absorb them. It has, in their art,
    the shape of the Self, and so it is regarded by them as their essence and product: see ¶¶439
    and 444 on individualism in the ethical order. In this respect it is quite different from the
    oriental religions considered so far.
¶701. 1. In its religion the ethical spirit rises above its mundane reality and acquires self-
    knowledge. The ethical people is trustingly absorbed in its customs and everyone is content
    with their restricted duties and social position. It lacks the individual self-consciousness and
    the idea of an unbounded Self that religious self-consciousness requires. So religion perfects
    itself when individuals are detaching themselves from the ethical society and becoming self-
    certain individuals. The rights and duties distributed among them succumb to the same
    dialectic as did things and their properties in perception, culminating in the self-certain
    individual: cf. ¶446. Individualism runs riot. There are two sides to the ethical spirit. It
    begins as simple trust, but then expires in disorder. Two extremes, the substance and the
    Self, were held together by spirit. When the trust in substance declines, spirit emerges as the
    all-important Self which regrets the loss of its essence and, elevated above the fray, recreates
    it in art.
---
      

¶702. 1. Absolute art, art that adequately portrays the absolute spirit, arises during the decline
   of an ethical society. Before this the artisan instinctively manipulates concrete objects; he is
   not a free Self rooted in a free ethical order. Afterwards spirit transcends art. In Christianity
   what is presented is not just something produced by the Self, but humanity itself, repre-
   sented by Christ. The Christian drama is thoroughly conceptual in a way that Greek art is
   not. Art, life, and the concept coincide.
¶703. 1. The artist’s activity depends on the withdrawal of ethical substance from concrete
   reality. He has rid himself of the fixed preconceptions and unconscious entanglement with
   Being-there that plagued the artisan, even of his own attachment to the ethical substance.
   He is free to do as he likes with the material available to him, imposing form on it, but with a
   content of his own choosing. This form is the night in which substance was, like Christ in
   Gethsemane, betrayed and turned into a subject: cf. ¶17. But the ethical spirit is, like Christ,
   resurrected, recreated in art without the encumbrance of nature and its own concrete reality.
¶704. 1. Spirit has migrated from ethical life into a concept and this is now embodied in an
   artist. Spirit inspires him with a universal project and power, with a dominating pathos like
   that of a tragic hero: cf. ¶¶471ff. After a struggle, the artist brings all this under control. The
   essence that he has to represent is intrinsically shapeless and universal, but he succeeds in
   giving it an individualized representation.

a. The abstract work of art
¶705. 1. The first work, the statue of a god, is abstract because it does not involve language and
   self-consciousness. This will be followed by the hymn, which involves both. Finally, the cult
   unites the external statue and the interior self-consciousness of the hymn.
¶706. 1. The artist produces a shape remote from himself: see ¶708. It is divided into
   singularity, the statue of a god, and universality, the temple housing the god. The temple
   and its columns are quite different from those of Egypt. They do not use only straight lines
   and plane surfaces, nor do they imitate plant life. They eliminate most of the botanical
   elements (remnants of the tree trunks originally used for columns), and combine the
   straight and the incommensurable curve in a way that is congenial to the understanding
   and appropriate to the anthropomorphic form inside the temple.
¶707. 1. The statue inside the temple is the Greek equivalent of the black stone: see ¶696. It no
   longer has animal features, though gods sometimes disguise themselves as animals and may
   be symbolized by animals. The characteristics we share with animals, especially the male
   genitals, are represented, but only on the surface, with no hint of the organic purposes they
   serve. The god unifies nature and self-conscious spirit. E.g. Athena is a singular natural
   shape representing, for self-consciousness, Athens. Nature is subdued, leaving only rem-
   nants of the pre-Olympian gods, the twelve children of Uranus (heaven) and Gaia (earth),
   who ruled the world before Zeus overthrew them. Typhon was Gaia’s last child, fathered by
   Tartarus, the god of the underworld, and even worse than the Titans. Zeus eventually
   defeated him and imprisoned him beneath Mt. Etna.
¶708. 1. The temple and the statue have brought all the chaotic singularity of the world into
   tranquil individuality. But confronting this is the individuality of the artist, who is left
   outside his product with only his restless activity. The work is incomplete unless it also
   embraces its production by him. The concept of a work of art is that it is consciously made
   by human hands and this concept exists just as a concept in the artist’s activity. Everything
   else in the artist, he has transferred into the work, giving its specific details and their physical
   embodiment. But this concept remains outside it. We cannot forget the artist despite his
   best efforts to forget himself, and this goes for the spectator too. The two aspects of the
   artwork, the doing and the ‘being-a-thing’, must be brought together again. (The spectator is
   introduced surreptitiously, and goes beyond what Hegel’s argument strictly licenses.)

                                                                                                               

¶709. 1. The artist does not achieve equality with his work. However much the audience admire
    him and revere his work as a god, neither the audience nor his work capture the pain of his
    activity. He does not rate himself below his artwork, even if they despise it. If they revere it as a
    god, he feels superior to it. But it is not his equal: he does not recognize his own spirit in it.
¶710. 1. The god has now sunk into the externality of an unselfconscious thing. So he needs
    another outlet, language: cf. ¶508, where the language of culture is described in similar
    terms. Now the god is ensouled and no longer just a thing; he is combined with the pure
    activity that previously contrasted with him. Self-consciousness is at home with itself in its
    essence, the god, and is thus pure thinking or, at least,                    ‘devotion’, Andacht, which is not
    thinking, but on the way to thinking, as its etymological connection with                           denken     suggests:
    cf. ¶¶217 and 571.
¶711. 1. In contrast to the hymn, the oracle does not express truths that are generally accepted.
    Since the god is essentially involved in spirit as well as nature, he has to speak. But since this
    concept of god is not yet incorporated in religion, he speaks as an alien and singular self-
    consciousness, not as the universal Self of the community. What he says corresponds to the
    nature of the religion in question. The simple general claims he makes in the religion of light
    seem trivial to more developed self-consciousness.
¶712. 1. In the religion of art, universal truths are known without recourse to oracles, as are
    the unwritten laws mentioned by Antigone in Sophocles’s                           Antigone, lines 456f: cf. ¶437.
    Even here, however, people rely on their god for particular truths of use to the god’s
    community. Socrates derived universal truths by thinking, but relied on his                             daimonion, a
    ‘divine something’, for specific advice about what not to do: Plato, Apology 31c–d, 40a.
    Universal consciousness, less wise than Socrates, relied on birds, trees (esp. at Dodona), and
    the utterances of a priestess intoxicated by fumes rising from the earth (at Delphi). This is
    no worse than confidently relying on one’s own understanding and deliberation, since the
    results of this depend on one’s contingent character and capacity. In fact it is better to appeal
    to omens or toss a coin, since that doesn’t make so much of contingency. It is best to
    deliberate, while recognizing its fallibility.
¶713. 1. Spirit’s true expression in speech is the hymn, not the oracle. The statue is external, at
    rest, and selfless, while the hymn is internal to the Self and vanishing. They need to be
    combined to iron out their defects.
¶714. 1. It is the cult or worship that combines language and the statue. Each moves in the
    direction of the other. The Self emerges from its interior to become conscious of the god’s
    descent to it, and the god sheds his externality and objectivity, and actualizes himself in self-
    consciousness. On cult or worship, see also Hegel (1895), I, pp.65–73, 229–46.
¶715. 1. The soul is immediately one with the god. It does not distinguish itself from the god, as
    consciousness would. There is nothing in the soul apart from the god. It is just a blank space
    prepared for his arrival. It first purifies itself consciously, by washing and various other rituals.
    But it does not delve into its depths and become aware of its evil and sinfulness. That is a
    Christian rather than a Greek characteristic. The path of labours and the journey to bliss are
    only represented and do not take place in reality. Hyppolite, II, p.234, n.31, suggests that Hegel
    is thinking of Orphism and Pythagoreanism. He may also have in mind the ‘Eleusinian
    mysteries’, a rite held annually at Eleusis in honour of Demeter and Persephone: see ¶¶721–4.
¶716. 1. The journey to bliss described in ¶715 was only represented and did not actually
    occur. But some action must be performed. What happens is that the god descends from his
    remote universality and joins together with the singular worshipper. That is, consciousness
    becomes pure self-consciousness.
¶717. 1. The two sides are the worshipper and the god. The worshipper looks at things in two
    ways. As actual consciousness it sees the essence as nature, in the form of its own property
    (e.g. bread and wine) and of itself as a single individual. As pure consciousness it looks at
---
      

   nature as a sign of the god, to which it sacrifices itself, just as it consumes the bread and
   wine. The god is thereby brought down to earth and, conversely, natural objects, including
   the worshipper, are given a universal significance.
¶718. 1. In the sacrifice, the Self surrenders his property, and his own action, to the god, and
   acquires a universal significance. Conversely, the remote, abstract god surrenders himself
   too, since the sacrificial animal is a sign of the god, and bread and wine symbolize the
   goddess of agriculture and the god of wine. The gods have already implicitly renounced
   themselves by becoming plants and animals. The Self makes this explicit and, in doing so,
   puts himself in the place of plants and animals. For the union with the god elevates the Self,
   rather than demoting it. So only a small part of the sacrificial victim is put in the ground for
   the gods of the nether world. After this first sacrifice, the best bits are used for a ritual feast
   to celebrate man’s union with the god.
¶719. 1. This cult, with its devotion and feasting, is                    fleeting and leaves nothing objective
   behind. So the next step is to build a temple. Everyone can participate in this, just as they
   did in the cult, not just an individual artist. The labourers are                   represented, or imagined, as
   winning divine favour by thus honouring the god. But they also gain real benefits, not just
   their own estrangement and the god’s honour. Their temples are packed with treasures for
   the glory and enjoyment both of the god and of the community.

b. The living work of art
¶720. 1. The religion of art gives their due both to the ethical State and to the Self. It contrasts
   with the religion of light, in which the Self is rejected, while only the substance is recognized
   and the god is revered as empty depth, unlike the friendly Greek deities. However, Greek
   religion lacks depth, both in its gods and in its knowledge. The religion of light is primarily
   Zoroastrianism: see ¶685. It seems probable, however, from Hegel’s stress on its depth and
   his reference to a ‘rejected people’, that he also has Judaism in mind. The ‘self-conscious
   people’ referred to in the second sentence may well be the Jews rather than the Greeks. Light
   is also a prominent theme in Judaism: ‘And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
   And God saw the light, and it was good, and God divided the light from the darkness’
   (Genesis 1:3–4). If Zoroastrianism, about which Hegel knew little, is a metaphor for
   Judaism, about which he knew a great deal and wrote extensively in Hegel (1948), this
   would account for the unusual prominence given to the religion of light and also for the
   otherwise surprising omission of Judaism: cf. ¶680. See also ¶803, where the religion of light
   is associated with Spinoza.
¶721. 1. As in ¶687, the rising of the sun represents the ascent of substance, while its setting
   represents the transformation of substance into the subject. So in its night substance has
   become pure individuality. This individuality is no longer the artist, struggling with his
   product. It has seen the work and its elimination of objectivity, and so is satisfied. Like the
   artist, it too has a pathos (cf. ¶704), which intrinsically belongs to the rising sun, but since
   the sun has now set, it is now the pathos of contented self-consciousness. The essence has
   realized itself in nature. It supplies nourishment for the egoistic Self, whose consumption
   perfects and spiritualizes nature. The spirit of the Earth (cf. ¶360) has become both
   Demeter, the goddess of the harvest, and Dionysus (Bacchus), the god of wine.
¶722. 1. The mystery of the rising sun is revealed after it has set. Enjoyment of bread and wine
   in the mysteries of Demeter (Ceres) and Dionysus (Bacchus) unites the Self with the gods.
   There is nothing really mysterious about these mysteries: the Self is manifest to itself in its
   union with the essence. However, this revelation is still immediate and devoid of thought.
   Religion requires more than this: see ¶724.
¶723. 1. Demeter’s daughter, Persephone, was abducted by Hades, the king of the underworld.
   It was eventually agreed that she would spend half the year on earth with her mother and
---
                                                                                                           

    half in the underworld. In autumn and winter Demeter mourns the loss of her daughter.
    The light-essence is also personified in Dionysus, who                    first deals with the grape harvest,
    then runs riot with the maenads, as depicted in Euripides’s play, The Bacchic Women. Life is
    not yet governed by the rational concept.
¶724. 1.    ‘Absolute’    here means something like ‘cut loose, detached’ (from the Latin                     absolvere,
    ‘to set free’), not, as it often does, ‘all-embracing’. Demeter (Ceres) was one of the twelve
    Olympian gods, and Dionysus (Bacchus) was a late recruit to their ranks, but they were not
    the most important of them. Dionysus died and was reborn. So Hegel’s friend, Friedrich
    Hölderlin (1770–1843), likened Dionysus to Christ, especially in his poems Bread and Wine
    and The Only One. Hegel insists on distinguishing them.
¶725. 1. The Greeks held athletic competitions, especially at Olympia. Fire had been stolen
    from Zeus by the Titan Prometheus and given to man. A flame was kept burning at Olympia
    throughout the festival to celebrate this. Hence there were torch-bearers, though they did
    not run from city to city, as they do in the modern Olympics. Victorious athletes were
    honoured in their cities. So the festival was in honour of man. It is not, however, a
    celebration of spirit, in which the essence becomes a man, as it does in Christianity. It
    celebrates only one side of the essence, the beautiful human body, as distinct from the god.
    But it does prepare the ground for this revelation, by focusing on one aspect of it.
¶726. 1. The mysteries and the games each present the unity of self-consciousness and the
    essence, but each demotes one side, leaving it beside or outside itself: the Self in the case of the
    mysteries, the spiritual essence in that of the games. The wild internality of the mysteries
    must be combined with the lucid externality of the athletic body. Literary language is both
    internal and external in the required way. It is lucid and intelligible to everyone. It inherits the
    universality of the games, in which all Greek cities participated and the human body as such
    (unlike a statue) is attached to no particular city. Greek literature addresses all human beings.
c. The spiritual work of art
¶727. 1. The spirit of each people, represented by a totemic animal (such as the owl of Athens:
    cf. ¶¶689ff.) unites with others sharing the same language in a single pantheon of deities.
    This emerged from their cooperation in the war against Troy. (This seems at odds with the
    national spirit’s intuition of itself as universal humanity, but the Iliad expresses considerable
    sympathy with the Trojans; four Olympian gods support Troy: see ¶728.) They do not form
    a single State, but the trust and the participatory democracy of the city-state are temporarily
    suspended in favour of an assembly of heroes, not a bureaucratic organization in which
    individuals could no longer participate.
¶728. 1. The war takes place on two planes, divine and human. The gods, representing the
    national spirits, are under the supreme command, not the dominion, of their leader, Zeus,
    just as the Greeks are under the supreme command of Agamemnon. (Hegel neglects the fact
    that, in the Iliad, four important gods—Artemis, Apollo, Ares, and Aphrodite—support
    the Trojans, while Zeus is neutral.) The gods are universal substances of the self-conscious
    human action but, conversely, the human action is the force and the pivot on which the
    divine action turns: gods can do nothing without humans. The correspondence between
    the divine and human worlds looks contingent. But in later literature the divine essence
    will return into human self-consciousness; the pivotal role of humans foreshadows this
    unity.
¶729. 1. The content of these events is a whole world. So the consciousness of them must also
    be universal, linking with the events through representation in language: ‘epic’, which comes
    from epos, ‘word, song, poem’. The individual bard is not present at the events. His pathos is
    Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory and the mother of the Muses. The bard is simply a
    spokesman for his Muse, Calliope, the Muse of epic poetry. The epic is a syllogism: the
---
      

    universal gods and the individual bard are linked together by the particular human heroes,
    who are individual men, but raised to universality by being represented.
¶730. 1. The epic presents on a grand scale the unity of gods and men implicit in the cult. The
    action of men stirs up the divine world and lets loose its powers so that they can manifest
    themselves in the human world: cf. ¶¶464ff. on the ethical action. The action is performed
    on two levels, by the peoples and their leaders, and by the gods, the singular and the
    universal in an artificial juxtaposition. It is only men who give the gods anything to do. After
    the action is over, the gods withdraw from human affairs, and dissolve the ‘punctuality’ they
    acquired when they supported some particular hero. As usual, ‘selfish’                             (selbstische) and
    ‘punctuality’ (Punktualität) are used in accordance with their etymology and mean, respect-
    ively, ‘pertaining to the Self ’       and ‘atomistic singularity’.
¶731. 1. A god has a universal significance, but is also a determinate, rounded personality and
    therefore comes into conflict with other gods, in a comic subversion of their universality.
    Since they are immortal these conflicts are never really serious. Unlike human beings, they
    cannot risk everything in a mortal combat. There is, however, one power that dominates
    gods as well as men: fate or destiny. This adds a tinge of sadness to the life of the gods. Even
    Zeus e.g. could hardly save his mortal son, Sarpedon, from his fated death at the hands of
    Patroclus (Iliad, XVI, 419–61).
¶732. 1. This necessity of fate will bring together the contradictory elements of the epic and
    mould them into a coherent whole. The middle term of this will be the hero lamenting his
    early death. This is Achilles, the protagonist of the Iliad, who mourns the death of his friend,
    Patroclus, and foresees his own death (Iliad, XVIII, 329ff.). The extremes will be necessity
    itself and the bard. These play no specific part in the content of the epic. Necessity governed
    the whole course of the story and the bard recited it. Universal necessity (somehow
    represented as singular, perhaps because it is often personified) must now acquire a definite
    content, while the bard will become an actor. The content itself must become more limited
    and well-defined.
¶733. 1. A tragic hero represents and defends a cause or a pathos in its ‘universal individu-
    ality’. He or she does not have irrelevant personal peculiarities. A Greek actor always wore a
    mask, representing the character he portrayed. The ‘actor is essential to his mask’, in that it is
    essential for the characters to be real human beings, not—as they are in epic—simply repre-
    sented by a bard external to action itself. Hyppolite, II, p.247, n.68, suggests that, for Hegel, it is
    only in Christianity that the tragic Self is authentic and no longer merely represented.
¶734. 1. The drama takes place against the background of epic language spoken by no
    particular Self, but by the chorus. The chorus represents the general population rather
    than heroes, etc. Greek theology was still in some disarray, and the chorus does little to bring
    order into it. It is terrified of the higher powers, the divine law and the human law, that are
    the immediate       ‘arms’, i.e. limbs, of the substance, and of their conflict with each other: cf.
    ¶¶446ff. All it can do is recommend submission to necessity, which it fails to understand in
    terms of the character of the hero or of the intrinsic activity of the divinity.
¶735. 1. In contrast to the chorus, the spectator sees spirit not as a dispersed jumble of
    elements, but as a conceptual division into divine law and human law, each represented
    by a hero(ine), who totally identify themselves with one of these powers. These hero(in)es
    are thus universal individuals (see ¶733), portrayed by an actor (‘authentic Being-there’),
    while the chorus convey their significance to the spectators.
¶736. 1. Ethical substance was considered in ¶¶444ff. Its religion is the consciousness of itself.
    The gods, who in epic fluctuated in their allegiances, now align themselves with one or other
    of the two powers into which the ethical substance is divided. They thereby become more
    like proper individuals, rather than aspects of the Self. We shall see another distinguishing
    feature of characters, besides masculinity and femininity, in ¶737.

                                                                                                  

¶737. 1. Because he adheres to only one of the divine powers, the hero is ignorant of the other
    power (usually that of the underworld), which will eventually come back to bite him. In
    Aeschylus’s trilogy, the Oresteia, Orestes has been instigated by the Delphic oracle, under
    the tutelage of Phoebus Apollo, to kill his mother, Clytemnestra, to avenge her murder of his
    father, Agamemnon. When Orestes is in turn pursued by the avenging Furies, Apollo
    cannot help him, but sends him off to stand trial before an Athenian court, chaired by
    Athena. Orestes was acquitted. Hegel is attempting to interpret all tragedies, especially those
    of Aeschylus and Sophocles, in terms of the conflict between the two powers that he derived
    from Sophocles’s       Antigone.
        2. After murdering his father, Oedipus solved the riddle of the sphinx: ‘What walks on
    four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?’ (Answer: ‘man’).
    But his knowledge did not save him from the oracle’s prediction.
        3. Orestes.
        4. The priestess at Delphi is as deceptive as the witches who deceived Macbeth.
        5. Hamlet wisely distrusted his father’s revelation that he had been murdered.
¶738. 1. In Aeschylus’s Eumenides, Athena persuades the Furies to accept Orestes’s acquittal.
    They are transformed into the Eumenides, the ‘kindly ones’, and from now on will be
    venerated in Athens. The world is an ambiguous mixture of good and evil, and evil must be
    taken on board. The god who is revealed and knows is presumably Apollo rather than Zeus,
    since the Furies do not have equal authority with Zeus: see ¶739.
¶739. 1. The three essences are the Furies, Apollo, and Zeus. Zeus combines the functions of
    the State and the family. The distinction between the family and the State is represented in
    the play, not by two deities, but by two human personages, especially Antigone and Creon.
    By contrast, the distinction between knowing and not knowing appears in each hero, and
    only behind the scenes are they represented, respectively, by Apollo and the Furies. Zeus
    unites these two powers, since he represents substance as a whole. In this substance, there is
    real knowledge, but it is simple, i.e. ‘onefold’               (einfach), not double-edged. Human con-
    sciousness, which always involves unknowing as well as knowing, is rooted in this sub-
    stance, where there is no such distinction. The distinction is forgotten in this substance and
    replaced by lucid certainty. Zeus is on the way to becoming the Christian god. In Chris-
    tianity, Hegel believes, everything is open and above board, and all sins are forgiven.
¶740. 1. The two powers and the characters championing them are both right and both wrong.
    The powers and their blinkered, one-sided protagonists meet their doom. Lethe, a mythical
    river in Hades that made those who drank from it forget their past, reconciles the opposition
    in one way. In another way, Lethe on earth absolves sinners. Nothing remains except the
    calm simplicity of Zeus, who incorporates all the former heavenly combatants.
¶741. 1. Tragedy undertook a conceptual purification of the Homeric pantheon, as philo-
    sophers, such as Socrates, required. It eliminated the deities uselessly assigned to different
    functions, leaving only those responsible for the main powers. Increasingly, especially in the
    plays of Euripides, only one god is recognized. All powers are being concentrated in Zeus.
    He alone is the power of the State or of the family. He knows everything, and he decides who
    knows what. As Zeus of the oath and of the Furies he has access to people’s inner lives.
    Conversely, tragedies no longer present heroes with a pathos, but ordinary mortals with
    common passions.
¶742. 1. The personages of the pantheon, and the characters representing them, tend to fuse
    together into the unconscious force of necessity. This is the negative power, Zeus, that takes
    over the lesser deities. It absorbs the substantial essence and abstract necessity. However, this
    negative power is a sort of self-consciousness: it is the spiritual unity into which everything
    returns. As for actual self-consciousness, the chorus, or spectators, are helpless onlookers,
    filled with pity and fear, while the characters regard the divine unification as a poor substitute
---
      

   for the true unification involving a Self, as well as fate and substance. The actor doffs his mask,
   separating into a persona and a Self. The word ‘hypocrisy’ comes from the Greek hupokrisis,
   ‘acting a part’. The elevated quasi-Self of Zeus is about to become the spirit of comedy.
¶743. 1. Actors in Greek comedy did wear masks: see ¶744. So did the chorus in tragedies. For
   Hegel, the removal of the mask symbolizes the unhypocritical plain speaking of comedy
   about the gods and everything else.
¶744. 1. The comic Self has the gods in its power. It is elevated above them as if they were each
   just a property or attribute of a thing, pretending to be something in its own right. It plays
   with its mask to show that it is a Self, just like the actor and the spectator. There is some
   similarity to the resolution of the division between enlightenment and superstition, when
   heaven is transplanted to earth and the Self breaks free: see ¶581.
¶745. 1. The old gods took care of the natural and the ethical well-being of man. But now the
   divine order has broken down and man takes his fate into his own hands, with unhappy
   results. As for nature, the mystery of bread and wine has shown that it is there for the taking.
   Aristophanes makes fun of this in such plays as Ploutos (‘Wealth’). As for ethics, the demos,
   the people, in its popular assembly took complete control. Aristophanes pokes fun at its
   absurd pretensions and disregard of rationality. He particularly despised their demagogic
   leader, Cleon, whom he bitterly satirizes in, for example, the                    Knights.
¶746. 1. Now we turn to the ‘rational thinking of the universal’ mentioned in ¶745. Deprived
   of any divine support, the determinate laws, rights, and duties, accepted uncritically by the
   chorus of common men, succumb to the corrosive dialectic of the sophists and are refined
   into the airy-fairy concepts of the beautiful and the good. These can accommodate any
   content whatsoever. In Aristophanes’s               Clouds, the elderly Strepsiades and his youthful son
   Pheidippides both attend Socrates’s school in order to acquire the art of specious argumen-
   tation. Strepsiades uses it to deceive his creditors, while Pheidippides uses it to justify
   beating his parents.
¶747. 1. Comedy presents, on the artistic plane, man’s appropriation and manipulation of
   fate, gods, and values. It is the end of Greek art, since there is now nothing objective to be
   represented. The actor no longer portrays a character other than himself, but has removed
   his mask and become a sheer individual like everyone else. That men (or                            ‘we’) collectively
   have supreme power does not entail that each individual does; he may well                            find other men
   as much of a nuisance as the gods were. But Hegel repairs this by stressing that his concern
   is not the singular Self, but the universal Self, imbued with a rationality that all men share:
   see e.g. ¶785.
C . THE REVEALED RELIGION
¶748. 1. In the subtitle         ‘Revealed’    here translates      offenbare, which means ‘manifest’, rather
   than ‘revealed’, which would be geoffenbarte, the past participle of offenbaren, ‘to reveal’.
   But this makes little difference, since Hegel also uses the verb and its past participle. What
   does matter is that for Hegel, a revealed or manifest religion is not a religion based on special
   divine revelation, but a religion that is accessible to everyone and not only to participants in
   particular mysteries or to the members of a particular culture. In Christianity everything is
   open and above board: cf. ¶739.
      On the emergence of the subject, though not the complete loss of substance, see also ¶17.
   Previously the Self was merely an accident of the ethical substance, but now it is the
   absolute, i.e. all-embracing, essence, while the former essence, both human and divine,
   has been reduced to a predicate of it. This is a light-hearted result, both because it was
   effected by comedy and because the baby has been thrown out with the bathwater. Spirit is
   now self-conscious, but it has nothing to be conscious of, apart from itself. It is like the
   apocryphal bird that thought it could              fly faster if the air were removed entirely.

                                                                                                             

¶749. 1. We should consider this proposition in its historical context and that, as ¶750 will
    reveal, is the ethical spirit of ¶¶444ff. Proposition (1) ‘The Self is the absolute essence’
    reduces the essence to the Self: cf. ¶61 and note on reductive identity statements. But in the
    ethical spirit, this was inverted to become: (2) ‘The absolute essence is the Self ’. This
    proposition seems to make the substance into the (grammatical or logical) subject, and
    the Self a mere predicate of it; it reduces the Self to the essence or substance. (Hegel’s failure
    to distinguish different senses of          ‘subject’ obscures his account, but does not undermine it.)
    But neither proposition intrinsically reduces one of the terms to the other; each can be read
    as affirming some sort of parity between them. And if we were to switch from proposition
    (1) to proposition (2) in this reductive sense, we would be back at the beginning again,
    natural religion. But we cannot do that, since this inversion is performed for and by self-
    consciousness: it would be refuting itself if it accepted its own reduction to substance.
    Because of this, if self-consciousness does accept proposition (2), it abandons or estranges
    itself consciously and therefore remains the subject of substance. If proposition (2) demotes
    the subject, while proposition (1) demotes the substance, and self-consciousness accepts
    both, the result is not the sheer difference of Self and substance, as Cicero is different from
    Caesar, nor is it their sheer identity, as Cicero is identical to Tully. It must be their unity-in-
    difference, where both have equal value but neither could do without the other. Hegel has in
    mind the unity-in-difference of God and man. A secular example might be the relationship
    between a society, or State, and its self-conscious citizens, as long as this involves the
    reciprocal movement that Hegel requires: see ¶755.
¶750. 1. In the ethical spirit, to which Greek art belongs, the Self is submerged, as in
    proposition (2) of ¶749. It gives way to the state of right (¶¶477ff.), in which the Self, as
    an empty person, is the absolute essence, as in proposition (1) of ¶749. The gods of various
    peoples in the Roman pantheon are correspondingly empty. They are not the vivid,
    independent gods of epic, but            figments of abstract thought, as spiritless as the persons.
¶751. 1. What is here referred to as ‘unhappy self-consciousness’ was in fact called ‘unhappy
    consciousness’ in ¶¶206ff. The unhappy consciousness is not self-conscious in the way that
    scepticism is. But the difference may not be significant, since Hegel reverts to ‘unhappy
    consciousness’      in ¶752.
¶752. 1. There are two consciousnesses, one unhappy and the other happy. The comic
    consciousness is happy: it has absorbed the divine essence, substance has estranged
    itself. It does not yet realize how unhappy it is. The unhappy consciousness feels that
    it has lost both the substance and its Self, transposing itself into an unattainable Beyond.
    It now expresses this as ‘God is dead’, a claim associated with Nietzsche. It was, however,
    a stock theme of Lutheran theology, and was used by Hegel (1977), p.190, as well as
    in ¶785.
¶753. 1. In the Roman Empire, the ethical world and its religion are just relics of the past,
    emptied of all the life they once had, just as they are for 19th–century Germans. The
    unhappy consciousness is aware of this loss, and its personality, both legal and rational,
    mean nothing to it. Everything from that world—oracles, statues, hymns, games, festivals—
    is present to us, as to the Romans, like fruit plucked from its trees and offered to us by a girl.
    The fruit is withdrawn from its natural context, but the self-conscious gleam in the girl’s eye
    suggests that she has elevated the fruit to a higher level. So too the spirit that preserves these
    artworks for us is higher than the ethical world in which they appeared in a dispersed and
    external form. It internalizes them and gathers them all together in a single pantheon. This
    pantheon is spirit conscious of itself as spirit.— ‘Recollection’ translates                    Erinnerung, which
    Hegel then writes as Er-Innerung, ‘re-collection’, to indicate that it is to be taken in the sense
    of ‘internalization’, contrasting with their former externalization. Cf. ¶808, where the whole
    of PS is regarded as a       Er-Innerung, recollection-cum-internalization.

¶754. 1. The conditions for the emergence of the spirit conscious of itself as spirit (see ¶753)
    constitute its concept which, like the plan embodied in a seed, will develop into this spirit.
    Artworks comprise the forms in which absolute substance (God) estranges itself into a
    sensory object: spoken language, attached to the Self and evanescent; unity with universal
    self-consciousness; the beautiful body of the Self; and the world of epic and tragedy, which
    eventually turns into a universal self-certainty. All of these forms will now be involved when
    the absolute substance estranges itself into Christ. In the outside world of right, Stoicism,
    scepticism, and unhappy consciousness are condensed into the simple concept that will
    develop into self-conscious spirit.
¶755. 1. According to proposition (1), ‘The Self is the absolute essence’, substance estranges
    itself into the Self, while according to proposition (2), ‘The absolute essence is the Self ’, the
    Self estranges itself into thinghood or the universal Self (though, seemingly, not just back
    into substance again): see ¶749 and note. The first estrangement, that of substance into the
    Self, is an unconscious necessity: substance is in itself, or potentially, self-conscious, but that
    is not enough for it to conduct or be aware of its own estrangement. By contrast, while the
    second estrangement also expresses self-consciousness’s implicit identity with its opposite,
    the universal essence, self-consciousness is aware of the transition and conducts it itself.
    Christ had an actual mother, but only the in-itself for a father. This symbolizes the union of
    self-consciousness and the substance.
¶756. 1. Spirit involves two estrangements, that of the essence into self-consciousness and that
    of self-consciousness into the essence. Some religions of the Roman Empire (such as neo-
    Platonism and the mystery religions of Isis and Mithras) acknowledged only the second of
    these, the Self ’s self-estrangement into substance, thereby regarding the whole world as
    imbued with spirit. But without the first estrangement, the genuine transition of the essence
    into self-consciousness, this is just an imaginative projection. It attributes to worldly reality
    a hidden sense that is not apparent to sober consciousness and that was far from the minds
    of the original adherents of the ancient religions that are now revived.
¶757. 1. The meaning of the objective world must be seen to emerge by conceptual necessity,
    not by the hyper-active imagination of self-consciousness. This process is structurally
    similar to the one we saw in chapters I–IV. We began not with self-consciousness, but
    with immediate consciousness of immediate sensory objects, and these eventually estranged
    themselves into the I of self-consciousness. The estrangement of substance into the Self is a
    sheer necessity, not something we can cognitively account for. But this is easily accommo-
    dated by the concept. The concept itself is immediate, but as it estranges itself or unfolds, it
    presents to us a necessity we can observe and understand. We cannot know why the
    incarnation occurred or, in less figurative terms, why at this time the world-spirit began
    to see itself in the objective nature of things. What we have done, in ¶754, is outlined the
    conditions of its occurrence.
¶758. 1. Absolute spirit has incarnated itself and has become conscious of this, i.e. it is widely
    believed that spirit has appeared as a man who is seen, felt, and heard: cf. 1 John 1:1. This faith is
    based not on imagination or a priori thought, but on sense-perception. The concept involves
    immediate Being (cf. ¶757) and this enables the religious spirit to become a simple positive Self,
    just as the worldly      spirit became, in unhappy consciousness, a simple negative Self. Christ is
    immediate, and seen, heard, and felt. Otherwise he could not be self-consciousness.
¶759. 1. In Hegel (1895), II, pp.327ff., Christianity is called the ‘absolute religion’                     in contrast
    to  ‘determinate religions’. It is not simply one religion among others, but somehow
    embraces all of them, and it is also self-contained in that spirit is manifest to spirit. It
    corresponds to       ‘absolute substance’, the ‘I that is We and We that is I’ of ¶197, the unity of
    different independent self-consciousnesses. Spirit knows itself by estranging itself: I get to
    know myself, e.g., by writing down my own thoughts, and analogously God gets to know

    Himself by expressing Himself in the immediacy of the incarnation. A substance has
    accidents or attributes: see Enc. I, ¶¶150f. A mere substance is indifferent to its accidents,
    but when it becomes a subject or Self, it expresses them externally and makes them known
    both to itself and to others. Consciousness does not know everything about its object if the
    object is other than itself. But when the object is the Self, it is entirely transparent to
    consciousness. This is the Self in the sense of the thinking Self, the inner core of the Self,
    which is manifest both to oneself and to others. (Otherwise, Hegel seems curiously oblivious
    to the opacity of the Self both to others and to itself.) When God is said to be the good, etc.,
    these may not be accidents of a substance, but they are predicates of a subject: see ¶23. We
    may know all these predicates without knowing the subject on which they hang. But when
    the subject is a Self, it is revealed entirely, since its very nature is to become conscious of
    itself by revealing itself to others. Thus to know Himself God must become a man. Since
    God knows Himself in this man, it follows that God’s nature is the same as human nature.
    Hegel (1895), I, pp.217f. quotes Meister Eckhart: ‘The eye with which God sees me is the
    same eye by which I see him. My eye and his eye are one and the same. In righteousness I am
    weighed in God and he in me. If God did not exist, nor would I; if I did not exist, nor would
    he’. (I have modified the Speirs–Sanderson translation.)
¶760. 1. Christ is both an immediate sensory being and a thinking self-consciousness. This
    looks like a descent from God, but it is really an ascent. The absolute essence has realized its
    concept. It thereby emerges both as the abstraction of pure thinking and as immediate
    sensory Being. This reminds us of the beginning of PS, where sensory consciousness was
    really abstract thought, but is aware only of immediate Being. That the low is also high is a
    recurrent theme in Hegel: see e.g. ¶346 on the dual function of the genital organ and also
    ¶775 and Enc. I, ¶24 Addition 3, where the biblical Fall is really an ascent.
¶761. 1. Consciousness is not only immediate consciousness of Christ but the religious
    consciousness of the Christian community, which views Christ as the absolute essence, as
    well as a Self that just is. This is essentially the same as our own philosophical knowledge,
    that Being is essence, except that religious consciousness puts it in the form of representa-
    tion. Speculative philosophy involves three stages, corresponding to the Trinity: it knows
    God as thinking or pure essence (in logic); it knows this thinking as Being-there (in
    philosophy of nature); and it knows Being-there as the Self, both singular and universal
    (in philosophy of spirit). This is what the world was waiting for: that spirit is known only in
    and by man.
¶762. 1. The first, immediate, revelation must be mediated by thought. Christ is so far only
    one individual man. To fulfil his concept he must become all men, the universal self-
    consciousness. Otherwise, he is not much help to other individuals, who do not know his
    self-consciousness as their own. This transformation is achieved initially not by conceptual
    thought, but in the representation of his death, resurrection, and ascension. This is similar
    to what happened in chapter II, when the sensory This passed into the thing of perception,
    not the universal of the understanding: humans are regarded as distinct perceptible things,
    not as participants in a shared rationality.
¶763. 1. The passage of Christ into the past (like the Now in ¶106) transforms the believer into
    spiritual consciousness. Christ is now resurrected in the spirit. The sensory presence of
    Christ, distinct from other Selves, was as much a hindrance as a help: cf. the unhappy
    consciousness       in   ¶212.    Now      that   he   has    gone,    spirit   becomes       the   universal  self-
    consciousness of the community of believers. What matters is not Christ alone, but what
    he is for this community.
¶764. 1. The immediacy of Christ’s sensory presence is mediated and universalized by its
    removal to a remote time and place. But this is just a representation, an artificial mixture of
    sensory immediacy and thought.

¶765. 1. The content of this representation is true, but the representational form is defective. It
    splits the world in two, earth and heaven, with no intelligible connection between them. In
    itself, i.e. for us philosophers, the religious doctrine has been comprehended conceptually.
    Now the religion should make this a reality, and elevate its consciousness up to the level of
    its self-consciousness.
¶766. 1. The absolute spirit is the substance of the religious community. But that is not
    enough. Nor is it enough to project it into representations. The absolute spirit needs to
    become an actual Self, a subject. This is the significance of the incarnation, and it is found in
    the community. It is therefore misguided to want to return to the first primitive community
    or to Christ’s own words. This confuses the origin of something with its concept. What
    matters is not what Christ was in the beginning, but what he is now.
¶767. 1. Spirit, as conceived by Christianity, involves three stages that correspond not only to
    the three persons of the Trinity, but to the three parts of Hegel’s system. The pure substance,
    or God the Father, is thinking or logic: cf. Hegel, SL, p.29:                 ‘It can therefore be said that this
    content is the exposition of God as he is in his eternal essence before the creation of nature
    and of a finite spirit.’ Logic descends into the singularity of Christ or into nature, the second
    part of the system. This involves representation especially, not only in religion, but also in
    Hegel’s system, since the description of nature requires determinate empirical concepts,
    such as that of a plant, not only pure thoughts, such as those of Being or of substance. Christ is
    other than God and nature is other than pure thought. Finally, in the holy spirit and in Hegel’s
    account of mind or spirit, spirit returns from otherness and representation into self-
    consciousness. Each of these stages is a sort of circle, which, in completing itself, moves on
    to the next stage: cf. Enc. I, ¶¶15 and 17. In religion, consciousness’s representation is not only
    especially associated with one stage, but is the form in which all three stages are presented.
¶768. 1. Some of this was anticipated by the unhappy consciousness and by faith: see ¶¶206ff.,
    and 527ff. But both located spirit beyond the conscious subject, whether subjectively, as in
    unhappy consciousness, or objectively, as in faith. In Lutheran Christianity spirit is the
    substance of the community.
¶769. 1. The incarnation is not simply an external addition to God, but a necessity intrinsic to
    his nature. If the eternal essence did not reveal itself as spirit, it would be spirit only in name.
    In fact, it would hardly make sense at all: it would be like an essence or force, such as
    electricity, that never manifested itself in any actual occurrence. God is just a pure
    abstraction unless he generates something other than Himself, with which he is contrasted.
    The fact that God is pure thinking supplies the mechanism for this, since thinking is
    essentially negative: it necessarily moves beyond any given thought to another thought
    that is implicated in it, if only by contrast. Even God Himself does not really know who or
    what He is, unless he manifests Himself; only in this way does He become a Self or a
    concept. He thus becomes different from Himself. But since this difference is necessitated by
    God Himself, it is not really a difference at all. Religion represents all this in pictorial terms,
    as a birth and as an ascension.
¶770. 1. There are three moments in God: the essence, which is in itself, then two types of
    Being-for-itself, one that is other than the essence and that recognizes the essence, and
    another, where the essence recognizes itself in this other. This knowledge of itself in the
    other can be illustrated by the utterance of a word: cf. John 1:1:                     ‘In the beginning was the
    Word [Logos], and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.’ An utterance is
    different from the speaker, but the speaker himself hears it and in that sense is reunited with
    it. The three moments are like this: the distinctions between them dissolve immediately and
    form a circular movement.
¶771. 1. The unconceptual representation of this content distorts it. The stages of Father, Son,
    and holy spirit become quite distinct from each other, linked by no conceptual necessity.
---
                                                                                                

    They are also seen as quite distinct from the believer: he relates to them externally and does
    not recognize his own self-consciousness in them. One response to this is to reject it all as an
    old wives’     tale, and this is quite correct from a conceptual point of view. But because the
    response is only instinctive, it throws out the baby along with the bathwater. It rejects the
    content of faith as well as its representational form. The content can only be extracted and
    retained by hard conceptual thinking.
¶772. 1. This is the beginning of an account of God the Son. In Christian theology, the Trinity
    operates on two levels, distinguished as the economic Trinity (or the Trinity of history) and
    the immanent (or ontological) Trinity: see Powell (2001), pp.120–34. The economic Trinity
    is the triad as it appears in the world. The immanent Trinity is the intrinsic triadic nature of
    God which explains why He reveals Himself in the economic Trinity. These two types of
    triad also appear in Hegel’s system. The triad Logic-nature-spirit/mind corresponds to the
    economic Trinity. But the Logic itself consists of three parts, the doctrines of Being, of
    Essence, and of the Concept. This triad corresponds to the immanent Trinity and is
    intended to explain why logic proliferates into nature and spirit. The absolute spirit is the
    whole Trinity, while the pure essence is only the first term of the Trinity. But according to
    the immanent Trinity God Himself, the essence, contains absolute spirit immanent in itself
    and is there only one moment within absolute spirit, i.e. the essence appears twice, once as
    the whole element in which absolute spirit resides and once as a moment within that whole.
    What needs to be explained is why the immanent Trinity develops into the economic
    Trinity, i.e. into God, Christ, and the holy spirit or, as Hegel regards it, logic, nature, and
    mind. The essence develops into the immanent Trinity within the realm of thought, because
    it is abstract and must therefore negate itself into an other, its Being-for-itself, i.e. the
    immanent Son: cf. ¶770 on the two levels of Being-for-itself. But this is a relationship within
    pure thinking, so the other is not really other and the difference is not real difference, but a
    loving relationship between the moments: on God and love, cf. ¶19. This is still the
    immanent Trinity. But the absolute spirit in pure thinking is a simple unity and has an
    intrinsic tendency to actualize itself as the economic Trinity, just as the essence had to
    develop into the immanent Trinity.
¶773. 1. Pure thinking necessarily passes over into representation, which is a genuine element
    because, unlike pure thinking, it allows the moments of the concept to become independent
    of each other. They are not only different from each other in the eyes of a third party. They
    are subjects, actively differentiating themselves from each other. Representation separates
    things from each other: cf. ¶771. But Hegel is no longer thinking of the narrative of Christ,
    but rather of the created world. His alignment of the Son with nature in his own system
    tends to equate the incarnation with the creation of the world.
¶774. 1. God creates the world. This is the way in which religious representation presents what
    is in fact a logical necessity, that pure thought or the concept should actualize itself in
    concrete reality or Being for another. Hegel is attempting to explain why there is anything at
    all rather than nothing. His argument is that God, or pure thought, could not be what it is, if
    it did not actualize itself, that God, abstract thought, etc. could not be, or be appropriately
    described as, God, abstract, etc. unless there were something concrete, etc. contrasting
    with them.
¶775. 1. Since what actualizes itself is spirit, it actualizes itself in a Self that is conscious and
    distinguishes itself from the environing world, but not yet aware of being spirit and hence
    not fully fledged spirit. It is innocent, like an animal, rather than good. So it must undergo a
    process similar to that by which God ‘created’ the world, i.e. become other than itself. It does
    this by withdrawing from its dispersed consciousness and into itself, becoming a self-
    conscious thinker. It is not yet intellectually advanced enough to have pure, logical thoughts.
    So the thought it has is that of good and evil; this gives it the possibility of becoming evil as
---
      

    well as good, and hence introduces evil into the world. (Hegel’s interpretation of the Fall
    commits him to rejecting the traditional doctrine of Augustine and Aquinas that evil is
    simply a privation or the absence of good, like a button missing off a shirt. If that were so,
    then innocence would be evil. But innocence is neutral, while evil is a positive force.)
¶776. 1. The concentration of the Self into itself involves a disparity with itself, and therefore
    evil, especially as the opposition between good and evil is unresolved. But consciousness is
    also good, since it is facing up to this opposition and trying to resolve it. Now that the Self is
    a thinker and has a clearer idea of how God became other than Himself, it projects the
    emergence of evil back into the heavenly realm, that of thought. It personifies evil as Lucifer,
    God’s first son, who fell and was replaced by Christ, the personification of good. (Hegel is
    here influenced by Jakob Böhme (1575–1624), a Lutheran mystic and theologian: see Hegel
    (1895), II, pp.32ff.) We can look at this in two ways: concepts are brought down to
    representation (as a ‘fall’), or representation is transferred, even elevated (as the ‘son’), to
    thought. We can assign angels to the otherness in the divine essence, and transfer the self-
    concentration characteristic of humans to them. That is all right, as long as the diversity of
    the two sides is preserved. On one side is the son who regards himself as the essence, while
    on the other are the angels who adore God and have renounced their Being-for-Self; the
    latter side can accommodate the recovery of Being-for-Self and the self-concentration of
    evil. Now that the otherness is divided we have a quartet instead of a Trinity and, if we
    separate the good from the bad angels, a quintet. In fact, however, numbers are superfluous
    here. Otherness is only one thought, that of diversity in general. We might think of one side
    as a plurality, but it cannot be sliced up into discrete entities, each corresponding to an
    abstract unit. Number and quantity are unconceptual in general: ¶¶281, 286, 623, etc.
    Findlay (1977), p.587, said in his comment on this ¶: ‘Note Hegel’s incorporation of Evil
    into the Absolute’. Whatever else Hegel may have believed about the absolute, he did
    not believe that it was purely good to the exclusion of evil. Evil, and falsity, must be taken
    on board.
¶777. 1. Man is not tied to either good or evil, but is only the arena of their conflict. They are
    actualized, however, only in the Self. Hence, evil is man’s self-concentration, while the good
    comes out into the open as a self-consciousness. This is a representation of God’s self-
    abasement in Christ, a more vivid version of God’s becoming-other prefigured in pure
    thought. Religious representation excludes evil from God. Böhme tried to find it in God’s
    anger, but without sufficient conceptual equipment to make this plausible.
¶778. 1. Here        Hegel     speaks     of   ‘alienation’     (Entfremdung),        rather    than    ‘estrangement’
    (Entaüsserung) to indicate that good and evil are alien to each other and not reconciled.
    The alienation takes two forms. In Christ the divine essence is essential, and the Self
    inessential, while in sinful man the Self is essential and the divine essence inessential.
    Between them there is only a communality that cannot serve as a middle term linking
    them, a Gemeinschaftlichkeit, not a proper community (Gemeinde).
¶779. 1. In the religious representation Christ and man are independent of each other. It
    follows that each of them undertakes its own dissolution as a conceptual necessity. If there is
    any conflict, it is at the level of pure thought within each party, not where they are
    independent mixtures of thought and reality. But here Hegel focuses on their independent
    reality. The first move is made by Christ. He is the party that is in itself, since in him divine
    simplicity predominates over Selfhood and his earthly existence is therefore more precar-
    ious than man’s. He goes to his death and reconciles God with himself. When God first
    became other, i.e. in the creation-cum-incarnation, God acquired sensory presence, natural
    reality, and a Self. This is now withdrawn by a second becoming-other, viz. Christ’s death,
    and made universal. Worldly reality is no longer alien to God, but imbued with spirituality.
    Christ’s death is the resurrection of the divine essence as spirit.

¶780. 1. In ¶779 we considered Christ’s part in the reconciliation. Now we turn to man. The
    transformation of the self-conscious essence into universal self-consciousness signifies the
    establishment of a religious community, the third member of the Trinity. This has already
    been    represented as the descent of the holy spirit, but now it leaves realm of representation
    to become human self-consciousness. Philosophical truths are expressed in religious rep-
    resentation. The creation declares that the god and human nature are not separate. That
    God’s human products withdraw into themselves and become evil at the very start implies
    that evil is not alien to God, but essential to spirit. (As Goethe said: Nemo contra Deum nisi
    Deus ipse, ‘No one against God but God Himself ’.) The unity of God and the withdrawn Self
    is also expressed in the incarnation, but represented as a later event. The reconciliation
    between them is represented in Christ’s death, resurrection, and ascension. In conceptual
    terms, this reconciliation can be expressed as                 ‘Evil is in itself the same as the Good’, or as
    ‘God is the same as nature, especially human nature’. But we cannot stop there. It cannot be
    true unless Evil and Good cease to be what they were, and become, respectively, ‘Being-for-
    itself that is within itself ’ and ‘the selfless Simple’. Then it is obvious that they are the same.
    But even with this transformation, they are not the same, since the simple Being-for-Self, or
    pure knowledge, on which they both converge, again divides in two. So we must also say:
    ‘Good and Evil are not the same’. Clear-cut terms like ‘same’                      and ‘not the same’, and above
    all the copula ‘is’, cannot express the truth. This applies to the relationship between God
    and nature too. Both are transformed in their relationship, but the judgemental ‘is’                             cannot
    express this. We might say that nature is nothing without God. But even nothingness is: without
    God, it would be pure Evil. So nature is not flatly identical with God: it could exist, as pure Evil,
    without Him. Representation cannot handle this complex movement of unity-in-difference. So
    self-consciousness must now leave the realm of representation. On unity in difference, see also
    ¶¶ 39 and 749, Enc. I, Preface to the 2nd edition (1827), and Enc. III, ¶573.
¶781. 1. The Christian community is the third member of the Trinity. Its task is to abandon
    pictorial representation and to bring out the significance of what is implicit in the represen-
    tation. Implicitly the god-man is universal self-consciousness, a self-consciousness that has
    reconciled Good and Evil and is united with God. The problem is that the self-consciousness
    that has to make this explicit is as yet evil, attached to the world and the singular Self. So first it
    has to elevate itself to universal self-consciousness in order to fulfil its task.
¶782. 1. So far man is the natural spirit, opposed to the universal consciousness. So the Self has
    to retreat into itself away from natural spirit. By our previous account, this would mean that
    the Self becomes evil: see ¶775. But that cannot be the case here, since the natural spirit is
    already evil; so the retreat must just be a way of convincing oneself that nature is evil. This is
    already a case of the inversion of meaning that characterizes proper knowledge. For it is only
    in religious representation that the world is seen as becoming and being evil, and later
    reconciled with God. This retreat into oneself is really a retreat away from the naturalness of
    representation into proper knowledge. This also affects the content of knowledge, not just
    its non-representational form. It takes on board the implicit content of representation but
    transforms it from temporal events into transient moments of thought. In representation
    the world, including humanity, is first evil and then later redeemed. In thought this becomes
    the idea that the world is both evil and good, since Evil and Good are both the same and
    different. See also ¶157 on the inverted world.
¶783. 1. For representation consciousness’s retreat-into-itself is Evil. For self-consciousness,
    by contrast, this retreat is the knowledge of Evil implicit in reality, and so a first step towards
    redemption. As St. Paul put it in Romans 6:11:                    ‘Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be
    dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.’                                    The inner
    withdrawal is a negation of a negation. It presupposes that nature has already withdrawn
    into itself and become evil, and so man must withdraw once more in order to escape Evil.

   Yet it is this inner withdrawal that is Evil. The two withdrawals look like one and the same.
   The solution of this paradox requires more thought.
¶784. 1. Besides the immediate inner retreat away from nature, representation’s mediation of
   this is needed. In itself the recognition of nature as an inadequate expression of spirit and the
   emergence of the universal Self, means that spirit is reconciled with itself. Religion does not
   see this as the conceptual reclamation of nature, but represents it as a sequence of events:
   creation, incarnation, and death. Now it goes further and represents the formation of a
   community as a spiritual resurrection. Christ’s death is really just his dissolution into
   nature. But religion transfigures it into the universal spirit of the community.
¶785. 1. In representation, Christ was a particular spirit representing spirit in its embodied
   reality. He has now been transferred into the self-conscious community, into knowledge of
   one’s own Self. This self-consciousness does not die, though Christ’s particularity does
   acquire a universal significance in its knowledge. So the second sphere of the Trinity, that of
   representation, has been absorbed into the Self and become a subject. The                           first sphere too,
   the god of pure thinking, has undergone a similar fate, since He cannot be detached from
   the Trinity as a whole, but must be rejuvenated as a subject or universal self-consciousness
   along with Christ. On the other side, man has risen to meet God halfway. He has become
   self-conscious and started to think. The death of the mediator, Christ, is not just the death of
   a particular man, but of the abstract God Himself, since this god is one side of Christ’s dual
   nature. God is dead: cf. ¶752. The Self has been whittled down to a bare self-conscious I=I:
   cf. ¶¶167, 233f., 652, 657, 671. But substance, rather than lost, has become a subject. The
   reign of representation is over, God has been brought down to earth, and humanity has
   become a universal self-consciousness.
¶786. 1. Spirit now knows itself, which is what religion, as the self-consciousness of spirit, aimed
   at all along: see ¶672. But spirit is not only the content or object of self-consciousness. It is also
   an actual and moving spirit in the form of the community. We have come across spirit as
   movement before, when in ¶670 it relaxed its immutability and pardoned sins, or when two
   opposed extremes recognized their mutual identity. Just so, consciousness now intuits the
   concept of spirit and erases the difference between the Self and what it intuits. There is now
   only one spirit, which is both substance and subject, engaging in a joint movement.
¶787. 1. However, the content of self-consciousness is still represented, and this introduces
   disharmony into the spirituality of the community, even though it has officially abandoned
   representation. Pure thinking was affected by representation too, since representation
   transmitted its static nature to thoughts. Moreover, the community is not conscious of its
   own nature. It lacks consciousness of its own self-consciousness; it cannot describe itself in
   the way we have done. ‘Devotion’ (Andacht, which is only on the way to thinking: cf. ¶710)
   cannot see that substance has become self-consciousness. It solves this problem of the
   disparity between its self-consciousness and its supposedly alien God by projecting its
   reconciliation with God into the distant future, just as previously it was thrown back into
   the remote past: see ¶¶763f. Christ, the singular divine man, had a real mother but only an
   implicit father. The community, the universal divine man, is similarly divided, between its
   own activity and knowing for its father, and eternal love as its projected mother, between its
   immediate consciousness and its dissatisfied religious consciousness.

(DD.) Absolute Knowledge
VIII. Absolute Knowledge
¶788. 1. Absolute knowledge will now pull everything together. Christianity presupposes an
   ‘object’ (Gegenstand) distinct from itself (God, Christ, etc.) and is therefore consciousness,
---
                                                                                                               

    which is, for Hegel, essentially consciousness of . . . , consciousness of an object distinct from
    the consciousness itself. In fact, this object is the product of the ‘estrangement’ or external-
    ization of consciousness, so that in being conscious of the object, consciousness is in effect
    conscious of itself, self-conscious. However, since it is not yet aware of this, it is not yet
    conscious of its self-consciousness, that is, it has not ‘overcome’ its consciousness. Its object
    is the result of     ‘representation’      (Vorstellen), rather than thought, both because                  Vorstellen,
    literally ‘placing before [oneself]’, is closely connected with ‘objectivity’ (Gegenständlichkeit)
    in its root sense of       ‘standing over against’, and because to conceive the object in terms of
    pure thought would ipso facto disclose its affinity to the Self. ‘Absolute spirit’ is spirit that is
    not dependent on, relative to, or restricted by anything else. The spirit of religion is not
    absolute in this sense, since it is apparently dependent on an object distinct from itself.
    However, its ‘content’         is absolute spirit. What needs to be sublated is the representational
    form. Since this form is essentially involved in all consciousness, the clue to its sublation
    must lie in the configurations that we considered earlier, consciousness, self-consciousness,
    reason, and historical spirit: see ¶¶679f. and notes. In these configurations the Self estranged
    itself in an object, just as it is doing now. The sublation is a two-way process. The object
    does disappear, but it only does so because self-consciousness produced it by its own
    self-estrangement and becomes aware of this in virtue of its overall tendency to estrange
    itself. Now it withdraws this self-estrangement; it still has an object of sorts, but it now sees it
    not as strange and alien but as an extension of itself in which it is entirely at home.
    Consciousness considers this object not only in religious terms but in terms of all the
    shapes of consciousness that it has passed through.
¶789. 1. Initially, the object is viewed in terms of the first configuration, Consciousness in
    chapters I–III. It is (I) immediate Being; (II) Being for another and for itself; and (III) a
    universal essence. As a whole it is a movement or syllogism from universality via
    determinacy to singularity, and back again: cf. ¶679. The object is not yet seen in the
    conceptual terms that are our ultimate goal. Conceptual knowledge, or logic, is indicated
    only in its slow emergence (as we indicated above in our abstract logical characterizations
    of the    first three shapes of consciousness) and, for now, we must stick to its incipient
    form in the shapes of consciousness. Hence the object is not yet a spiritual essentiality
    for consciousness. Consciousness is still a shape of consciousness of its own, comprising
    the logical kernel of all the previous shapes, but also several shapes which we philosophers
    pick out, to show how consciousness estranges itself in an object and then recognizes
    itself in it.
¶790. 1. Hegel is explaining his omission of the configuration of self-consciousness in chapter
    IV, which does not involve self-estrangement in the same way as the others. He proceeds
    directly to observing reason, which failed to               find its own active Self in its object. Its climax
    was the infinite judgement in ¶344,              ‘The Self is a thing’, a bone, not an imperceptible thing
    like the soul. In itself this judgement dispenses with spirit altogether, but we also saw, in
    ¶346, how the inversion implicit in this judgement, ‘The thing is the Self ’, rose to the height
    of spirit, as we shall see again in utility and moral self-consciousness.
¶791. 1. On utility, see ¶560. In ¶789 the thing appeared to perception as both Being-for-itself
    and Being for another, essentially related to other things. Now self-consciousness performs
    this operation itself, transforming a sensory independent thing into a thing that is only
    useful for something or someone else.
¶792. 1. A still deeper penetration of the thing is achieved in morality: ¶¶596ff. This passed
    through three stages. First moral self-consciousness is absolutely essential and nothing else
    matters, the moral world-view: ¶599. Then it resorts to shifting, giving something with one
    hand and taking it back with the other: ¶616. Finally, as conscience, it lives entirely in a
    world of its own.

¶793. 1. Gradually everything external to the Self is incorporated within it. All the stages of
    this process together constitute the reconciliation of spirit with its consciousness. The last
    stage, conscience, is the one that combines them all. Here the Self reigns supreme: its mere
    affirmation that it acted out of conviction of duty validates its action. Action opens up a gap
    between the Self and the world; it creates an objective state of affairs that may or may not
    correspond to the intention and assessment of the Self or, indeed, of others. But conscience
    brushes aside this gap by insisting that its conviction of duty is all that matters. This stance is
    ultimately unsatisfactory, but then the conscientious Self relents and receives forgiveness:
    see ¶670. We have here the three moments that we saw in ¶789: immediate Being-there,
    determinate Being-there or relationship, and the essence or universality, corresponding
    respectively to sensory certainty, perception, and understanding. Immediate Being-there is
    accommodated by acknowledging the importance of conscience. Determinate Being-there,
    which in ¶791 was represented as utility, is now accommodated as the oppositional
    relationship between the singular Self ’s dutiful action and the universal ethical order.
    This opposition is reconciled in the act of forgiveness, whereby the conscientious Self is
    reintegrated into the universal order, and the singular Self becomes identical with the
    universal Self: see ¶671 and note. The upshot is a society that gives their due both to
    the moral conscience and to the ethical order. This amounts to a reconciliation of
    self-consciousness, the singular Self, with consciousness, the universal Self, that we also
    find in Christianity.
¶794. 1. Religion effects this reconciliation in the form of Being-in-itself, or according to its
    absolute content. That is, it started out from God and eventually brought Him down to
    earth in the religious community, self-consciousness. Secular consciousness effected it in the
    form of Being-for-itself: it started at the other end, beginning with self-consciousness devoid
    of content and working its way upwards from there. In our exposition the secular recon-
    ciliation comes first, whereas in history religion effected the reconciliation much earlier.
    That is another respect in which its reconciliation is only in itself: it is only potential, only in
    representation, awaiting its full actualization in the secular world. What is needed is a
    combination of these two reconciliations, so that spirit knows itself as it is both in and for
    itself, i.e. so that the religious reconciliation is actualized in secular reality and, conversely,
    the secular reconciliation acquires an insight into its profound spiritual significance.
¶795. 1. The unification of the two reconciliations has already happened in religion, when, in
    ¶¶781f., it passed from representation to the self-conscious community. But religion is still
    burdened with a god distinct from self-consciousness. So the unification can only come
    from the secular side, which, as consciousness, is aware of religion as well. We have
    presented all the content of religion, as well as the other side, i.e. self-conscious spirit in
    its opposition to religion. All that is needed now is to put two and two together, to find the
    simple concept in which the two sequences are united. This is to be found in the beautiful
    soul, which remains enclosed in its concept, i.e. is averse to any action whatsoever. It is not
    only the intuition of God, as in religion, but God’s intuition of Himself, since there can be no
    god outside the Self: cf. ¶655 and note. In ¶¶658ff. we saw the beautiful soul’s reluctance to
    act, but also its positive self-estrangement and its realization of its concept in action. Then it
    actualizes its pure knowledge of itself in the world, not in the Beyond, as religion does. (The
    beautiful soul has some affinity to Hegel himself.)
¶796. 1. The secular conflict and reconciliation of ¶660 is now applied to the conflict between
    religion and the moral Self. The simple concept required both the action of spirit and the
    representational content of religion. In religion this content was other than consciousness,
    while in the acting spirit it is all within the Self. When the beautiful soul acts, it actualizes the
    life of absolute spirit, i.e. it does something similar to what God does when He descends into
    the religious community. In this process the beautiful soul ceases to be just a beautiful soul,
---
                                                                                                              

    and so too does God. The beautiful soul begins as a simple concept, consisting of an eternal
    essence, the content of religion. But the beautiful soul has to abandon this essence and act,
    simply because that is what an abstract concept must do. What it actualizes is its pure
    knowledge, which is involved both in actual Being-there and in the eternal essence, the
    religious content. In acting, the beautiful soul also withdraws into itself and thus becomes
    evil. This withdrawal splits the concept in two. The essence’s pure knowledge now enters the
    scene. This knowledge is intrinsically inactive, but simply in virtue of the oppositional split
    it becomes a combatant. There is a good side and a bad side to this division. It is evil in
    actualizing itself, but good when it is just in itself. All this happens in itself in the religious
    representation, but it is not until it is repeated as a conscious action and becomes known to
    consciousness that it is really fulfilled. There are now two parties in conflict with each other.
    Each party renounces its one-sidedness, but now in reality, not just in representation. The
    divine in-itself with which we began is really mediated by its opposition to the other party
    and now appears as one of the two self-renouncing parties. One party, the acting con-
    sciousness, is too individualistic and insufficiently universal, while the judging conscious-
    ness is too abstractly universal and out of accord with the Self. The                                first renounces
    its individualism and confesses: see ¶667. The second moderates its universality and
    acknowledges the living Self: see ¶670. The upshot of this is spirit, which unites the Self with
    universality. It presents the universal content of Christianity in the form of the worldly Self.
¶797. 1. The concept is the subject that combines the Self with the hitherto representational
    content. The Self now becomes the philosophical subject, who comes to know all reality,
    identifies itself with the substance, and treats this substance as the arena of its cognitive
    and practical activity. We extracted this concept from some of the previous shapes of
    consciousness and especially that of the beautiful soul. The content                           of this concept had
    already emerged in these shapes, but not the concept as such. The beautiful soul was
    initially only one shape among others, but now it has become the philosophical conscious-
    ness as a whole.
¶798. 1. Absolute knowledge is the shape of spirit that transcends all the preceding shapes. In
    conceptual knowledge the Self realizes its concept, while remaining within it. This is one
    reason why it is       ‘absolute’: it is entirely self-contained. Hegel regularly contrasts subjective
    ‘certainty’ with objective ‘truth’. But ‘certainty’ is not only, or even primarily, one’s certainty
    that something is the case, and ‘truth’ is not the state of affairs to which one’s certainty may
    or may not correspond. That of which one is certain is often something that one aims for,
    while the truth is what one actually gets, or the fulfilment of one’s certainty.                       ‘Truth’ in this
    sense is always the truth         of something; it does not contrast with falsity, since whatever one
    gets, or turns out be, is the truth of one’s certainty. Thus one might be certain of winning a
    race, but the truth of this certainty only comes about when one actually wins the race or,
    alternatively, loses it. Sensory certainty aims at apprehending singular entities, but its truth
    is the universal that it actually obtains: see ¶¶90ff. Again, spirit is the truth of reason’s
    certainty of being all reality; it fulfils what reason was aiming for: see ¶¶231f. and 438.
    Generally, any shape of consciousness in PS is the truth of its immediate predecessor, which
    does not entail that it is plain true. Absolute spirit is unique in PS in that its truth
    corresponds exactly to its certainty, and manifestly so. There is no truth at which it is
    aiming, but has not yet reached: this is another reason why it is absolute. Absolute
    knowledge is science, since it appears in the element of the concept, unlike the varieties of
    untrue knowledge that it had to confront on its way: see ¶76. (Wissen, ‘knowledge’, is similar
    to its close relative     Gewissheit, ‘certainty’: it aims at truth, but this does not entail its truth
    either in Hegel’s sense or in the ordinary sense.)
¶799. 1. The individual I is transformed into a universal I, in respect of which individual
    Selves do not differ from each other. It is the arena in which knowledge develops. In PS, this
---
      

   I divides in two and, as consciousness, has a content distinct from itself. In the Logic,
   the pure thoughts underlying the shapes in PS are unearthed and this content becomes the
   I itself, since the pure thoughts are the core of the I. The thoughts proceed from one to the
   next in accordance with the movement of the I. It is only in virtue of its embodiment of
   these thoughts that the spirit can survey itself in the way that it does in PS.
¶800. 1. Science, especially logic, does not appear in time until spirit has gone through the
   process recorded in PS and has thereby come to know what it is, raising its self-
   consciousness to the level of its consciousness. Before that spirit has a rough and ready
   comprehension of each stage as it comes along, but it has not yet grasped the substance as a
   whole, i.e. the whole course of PS, and so is not yet absolute knowledge.
¶801. 1. The substance is only fallible and inexplicit ‘knowing’, not systematic and explicit
   ‘cognition’. The Self has to submit it to conceptual cognition and extract it from its represen-
   tational form. Initially, then, the content of cognition is far thinner than substance and the pre-
   cognitive consciousness of it: cf. ¶91. But the revelation of substance to intuitive consciousness is
   really just concealment. It is only self-conscious science that reveals each stage and absorbs or, to
   put it more positively, generates every one of them. In conceptual science, therefore, the
   separate stages appear, one by one, earlier than the conceptually completed whole, whereas
   the consciously intuited, but unconceptualized whole appears before the stages of it.
        2. On time as the concept that is there, see ¶46 and note. Logic itself is atemporal, as is
   pure mathematics. It makes no sense to ask e.g. when pure Being became pure Nothing
   (Enc. I, ¶87) or when 2+2 became 4. Time is only necessary insofar as the Self has not yet
   conceptually incorporated the substance as it is for consciousness or, looking at it in another
   way, has not yet realized everything that the Self has in it. (The in-itself is regarded                         first as
   the conceptually undigested outer expression of substance, and then as the interior of
   substance that awaits outer expression.) Once it has done that the Self absorbs itself in
   atemporal logic. However, this escape from temporality is itself only temporary, since, as
   ¶808 suggests, science itself shows the necessity of spirit’s estrangement in time or history,
   as well as in space or nature.
¶802. 1. Pure science can only arise after spirit has emerged in historical time. This is
   experience, in which the truth is grasped in a hazy, conceptually unarticulated way. In
   experience spirit, as substance, presents itself to consciousness. In its historical advance
   spirit gradually becomes for itself, for self-consciousness, what it already is in itself, and then
   it is   cognized    conceptually, not only           known. Substance becomes subject: see ¶17. This
   process is circular; it presupposes its beginning and reaches it at the end. Only at the end
   can we fully understand the beginning, and why we began in that way. (In ¶18, by contrast,
   the circle   ‘presupposes its end as its goal, and has its end as its beginning’, but that amounts
   to the same thing: if we can only understand the beginning at the end this is because the
   beginning was motivated by the end in view. A novelist or an educator chooses their
   beginning in view of their goal, and the reader or pupil can only understand the beginning
   on reaching the end.) Spirit first has to complete itself in time, as world-spirit, before we can
   make philosophical sense of it: cf. ¶29, where Hegel distinguishes the historical process from
   his own exposition of it in PS. There are really three processes in play: (1) The unfolding of
   spirit in history; (2) Hegel’s exposition of it in PS; and (3) science proper. (2) And (3)
   presuppose (1). (2) More obviously presupposes its end, and reaches its beginning at the
   end, than (1) does; but Hegel tends to personify the world-spirit. (3) Presupposes (2) for
   Hegel’s readers, since for them (2) is an introduction to (3), but for Hegel himself (2)
   presupposes (3), or they both go together, since Hegel could not have embarked on or
   completed (2) unless he had already entered into the science that emerges at the end of (2).
   PS is both science and an introduction to science. Hegel’s use of ‘we’                         and ‘for us’ tends to
   blur the difference between himself and his readers.

¶803. 1. Here Hegel shows how the historical world-spirit led the way to science, beginning with
    medieval Christianity and proceeding through various post-Renaissance philosophers—Descartes,
    Spinoza, Leibniz, Kant, Fichte, and Schelling—until it reaches his own absolute knowledge.
        2. Cf. ¶¶240ff. on observing reason.
        3. This sounds like Descartes.
        4. This refers to Spinoza. It would be more accurate to say that he regarded substance as
    a unity of extension and         thought, but the introduction of Being associates him more closely
    with the religion of light: cf. ¶686.
        5. This refers to Leibniz, whose theory of monads restored the Self or subject, which, in
    Hegel’s view, Spinoza had dissolved into substance: see ¶17.
        6. With the enlightenment, individuality came down to earth as utility and in the
    glorification of the will began by Rousseau (and continued by Kant), and culminating in
    the French revolution. Fichte then plumbed its depths, regarding the essence as the pure I,
    I=I: on Fichte, see ¶¶17 and 23f.
        7. Whereas Kant regarded time and space as two coordinate forms of sensibility,
    Spinoza regarded extension and thought as the two attributes of substance, but not time.
    He was commonly interpreted as having denied the reality of time, in favour of atemporal
    eternity: see Hegel (1977), pp.104–10. Spinoza’s denial, or at least demotion, of time is
    facilitated by his demotion of the Self. Once the Self enters the picture, as it did in Fichte’s
    principle of I=I, so too does time, since the Self can only experience things in a temporal
    succession and also as future, present, and past. However, the fact that the I can only
    experience things temporally does not entail that external things really do follow one
    another in a temporal succession, certainly not in the historical movement required by
    PS. Hence on this account time readily collapses into static space, which is simply the
    sluggish I and not the dynamic I=I: cf. ¶169 on the time of living things.
        8. Fichte distinguished his own system sharply from Spinoza’s. Schelling, by contrast,
    although he was initially a follower of Fichte, attempted to take Spinozism on board and
    postulated a neutral absolute that was as much a substance as a subject and bifurcated into
    spirit and nature. Hegel regards Schelling as his own immediate predecessor, but is anxious
    to differentiate himself from Schelling and here repeats the criticisms levelled at him in the
    Preface: see ¶¶15, 16, 17, and 50.
¶804. 1. Spirit does not retreat into itself like Fichte’s I=I, nor submerge all difference into
    Schelling’s substance. Rather, the Self moves from one position to the other. It dives down
    into the substance to see what is there, then resurfaces again, as subject, to contemplate what
    it has found. Its immersion in substance is the Self ’s immediacy, but it reflects itself out of
    this, distinguishes itself from the substance and becomes a pure I. What it found in the
    substance is Being-there, the differentiated concrete reality that exists independently of the
    Self. This Being-there comes to light when the Self resurfaces and contemplates it. But the
    Self is only able to do this because substance cooperates: substance also has a tendency to
    become subject and to eject its content in an articulated form. So the I must not withdraw, as
    in Fichte, nor cast everything into the melting pot of the absolute, as Schelling does. It
    should respect the intrinsic articulation of the substance and let it develop itself. Hence
    knowing is seemingly inactive. Hegel’s idea is that in virtue of the ‘concept’, the conceptual
    system developed in the Logic, he is able to give an orderly account of the world, especially
    nature, but also of the shapes of consciousness in PS, while also explaining how the Self
    manages to do so. See also the Preface, esp. ¶¶3 and 32.
¶805. 1. In PS spirit is consciousness, i.e. it has an object distinct from itself. But now this
    process is complete and spirit has passed into the conceptual system of logic: the Self
    estranges itself into the content but remains immanent in it, since the content is the Self ’s
    own pure thoughts. Each determinate thought depends on its relationship to other thoughts

   and this propels a movement from one thought to another. The movement is free as well as
   necessary, since it depends on nothing but the nature of thought itself. Logic operates in a
   different way from PS. In PS a shape of consciousness, a type of knowledge, contrasts with
   its truth, what it really amounts to. The sublation of this difference leads to another shape of
   consciousness. In logic, by contrast, each moment is a concept that combines both the truth
   and the knowing Self, and it passes into a different thought in virtue not of a disparity
   between knowing and truth, but simply of its own determinacy. Despite this difference,
   every concept in logic does have a shape of consciousness corresponding to it. (But this does
   not entail that there is an exact one-to-one correspondence between concepts of logic and
   shapes of consciousness.) In PS a simple logical concept bifurcates into a shape of
   consciousness.
¶806. 1. Logic cannot remain absorbed in the contemplation of pure thoughts, but necessarily
   passes into consciousness, i.e. into phenomenology. Since in logic the Self is immediately
   aware of itself, it reverts to the beginning of PS, immediate sensory consciousness: see
   ¶¶90ff. This transition is similar to, and as mysterious as, the transition from logic to nature
   in  Enc. I, ¶244. See also ¶802 on the circularity of Hegel’s system.
¶807. 1. In estranging itself into phenomenology, the Self or spirit has not estranged itself to
   its full extent. In PS the object is still closely tied to a subject. What is considered in sensory
   certainty, for example, is not raw nature, but nature as seen through the spectacles of a
   thinking human being. What is needed is the release of the object into complete independ-
   ence, with all its contingencies. Spirit can do this, since it has knowledge, knowledge
   involves a knowledge of what it does not know or of its limit, and to know one’s limit is
   to know what lies beyond that limit and how to transcend the limit: cf. ¶80. Since Hegel
   regards this as a sacrifice on spirit’s part, the nature into which it passes is actual raw nature,
   not just Hegel’s conceptual consideration of nature in Enc. II. Time is also an aspect of
   nature (see Enc. II, ¶¶257–9), but here time is associated with human history, since nature is
   equated with the Self ’s Being as space. Nature is estranged spirit, but as it develops it gives
   rise to the subject, i.e. spirit or mind, as considered in Enc. III. However, it becomes clear in
   ¶808 that Hegel here has in mind actual human history, with all its meandering contin-
   gency, not the potted version he gives in Enc. III or even PH.
¶808. 1. Nature, in Hegel’s view, lacks a history; only human beings have a history. Here
   history does not emerge from nature, but directly from absolute knowledge or logic. Hence
   history is spirit’s estrangement into time, analogous to its estrangement into the space of
   nature. But as history proceeds, spirit is gradually restored by passing through a succession
   of ‘spirits’, i.e. cultures, which need to be digested by individuals: see ¶28 on the connection
   between the education of the individual and the education of the human race. This process
   is recollection, Erinnerung, which Hegel interprets as ‘internalization’, often hyphenating
   the word to make this clear.           Erinnerung is the converse of Entäusserung, ‘estrangement’    or
   externalization: cf. ¶753. In recollection-cum-internalization spirit takes a deep breath and
   withdraws into itself, but then generates a new shape, making use of everything it has
   recollected: cf. ¶80. This succession has a goal—to reveal the deep conceptual system that
   underlies its movement. In doing so, it both sublates its depth, and also expands it, by
   arraying it in worldly substance and in time. This is an estrangement of the conceptual
   system, but this estrangement is estranged in its turn, since the historical stages are
   recollected-cum-internalized by the Self and eventually result in the re-emergence of the
   conceptual system in its full atemporal glory. The succession and recollection of these spirits
   can be viewed in two ways, both as the contingent course of history and as our own science
   of knowledge as it appears on the scene: cf. ¶76. Together these constitute history compre-
   hended or conceptualized. This is also a fulfilment of religion, the descent of God to earth:
   cf. ¶19. It is thus represented by Calvary, the ‘place of a skull’ (Schädelstätte), as in Matthew

27: 33–4: ‘And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a
skull, they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall, and when he had tasted thereof, he
would not drink.’ This is the death of the absolute spirit, the isolated god, but He now has
mankind to keep him company, as Schiller says in his poem Die Freundschaft (‘Friendship’),
of which Hegel adapts the last two lines.

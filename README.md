Hi all, this is my analytics portfolio right now. Please take a look at my work. 

Bivariate choropleth:

This was made by joining two sources of electoral data (from the EU referendum and from the 2017 UK general election) with a UK electoral constituency geojson file. The colouring indicates both the quartile of support for leave and the quartile of support for the Conservative party or UKIP. This allows us to synthesize the data from two different choropleths into one visualization.

The visualizations the data was taken from can be seen below.

The first choropleth shows the proportion of leave support in the 2016 election:

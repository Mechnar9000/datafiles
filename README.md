Hi all, this is my analytics portfolio right now. Please take a look at my work. 

**Project 1: Bivariate choropleth**

This was made by joining two sources of electoral data (from the EU referendum and from the 2017 UK general election) with a UK electoral constituency geojson file. The colouring indicates both the quartile of support for leave and the quartile of support for the Conservative party or UKIP. This allows us to synthesize the data from two different choropleths into one visualization. Using quartiles provides richer insight into the political landscape of the United Kingdom, allowing us to identify Labour-supporting regions that were in favour of Brexit as well as Conservative voting areas that were in favour of remaining within the European Union.

The visualizations of the data sources that are synthesized above can be seen below:

The first choropleth shows the proportion of voters who voted to leave in the 2016 election:

The second choropleth shows the proportion of the electorate who voted for either the Conservative party or the UKIP party in the 2017 election.

Please note that, by tradition, the constituency that is held by the speaker of the House of Commons is not contested by the major parties. It has therefore been excluded from the data.

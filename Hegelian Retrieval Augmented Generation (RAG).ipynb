It is customary to begin a work by explaining in a preface the aim that the author set himself in the work, his reasons for writing it, and the relationship in which he believes it to stand to other earlier or contemporary treatments of the same subject. In the case of a philosophical work, however, such an explanation seems not only superfluous but, in view of the nature of the Thing,1 even inappropriate and misleading. For the sort of statement that might properly be made about philosophy in a preface—say, a historical report of the main direction and standpoint, of the general content and results, a string of desultory assertions and assurances about the true—cannot be accepted as the way and manner in which to expound philosophical truth. Also, philosophy moves essentially in the element2 of universality that embraces the particular within itself, and this creates the impression, more here than in the case of other sciences, that the Thing itself, in all its essentials, is expressed in the aim and the final results, whereas the elaboration is really the inessential. By contrast, we need no convincing that, in the general idea3 of what (for example) anatomy is—say, the knowledge of the parts of the body considered in their lifeless state—we are not yet in possession of the Thing itself, the content of this science, that we must in addition get to grips with the particular. Further, in the case of such an aggregate of information, which has no right to bear the name of science, a conver- sational account of aims and other such generalities is no different from the historical and unconceptual way in which the content itself (these nerves, muscles, etc.) is discussed. In the case of philosophy, by contrast, this would give rise to the incon- gruity that this manner of which philosophy makes use is shown by philosophy itself to be incapable of grasping the truth.4 '"

In Hegel’s system it corresponds to the transition from Logic to the philosophy of nature, showing how the logical ‘Idea’ necessarily burgeons into a world of space, time, matter, etc. and eventually into the human mind itself. The ‘becoming of Being-there as Being-there’ is associated with (among other things) this process, the transition from logic to nature, while the ‘becoming of the essence’ is presented in the Logic itself, the extraction of the logical essence of the world and the passage to higher and higher logical categories. The becoming of the ‘substance’, i.e. of the logical ‘essence’, passes over into ‘externality’, i.e. nature, where it is ‘for another’, i.e. known to us. The becoming of Being-there is the ‘withdrawal into essence’, perhaps in the sense that nature leads on to mind, the culminating phase of which is philosophy, i.e. logic. \n",

The world is no longer conceived as, say, an aggregate of contingent entities or as merely orderly. It is a world governed by universal laws and is an organic purposive whole. To infer the existence of God is not, in Hegel’s view, to infer the existence of an entity distinct from the world. It is to ascend from ‘Being’ to ‘thought’ and thus to elevate the world to thought.

Nevertheless, Hegel’s idea is that the essential elements in this progression are the ‘thought-determinations’, Being, nothing, becoming, etc.—or, in PS, the ‘shapes of consciousness’. The other words in the sentences in which they figure are simply the explanatory framework, explaining in particular why each thought- determination moves on into the next. ‘The true is the subject’, not in the sense of ‘subject’ in which it is correlative with a predicate, but in the sense of the subject of activity, as in \n",

The development of the absolute follows the same pattern: the original unity (the subject) splits in two (the subject and concrete reality), and then finds itself again in the world confronting it (human beings). The ‘true’ is not just the first stage of this process; it is the whole process in which God (the beginning) creates a world other than himself and then finds himself (the end) in the world. However, Hegel need not claim that the active subject is also a knowing, purposive subject. Even if the subject is blind energy, it still generates a diversified world different from itself, which eventually provides a sort of duplicate of blind energy—in the form, say, of human beings who experiment with it, write about it, etc.—though we shall be less inclined to say that this ‘equality’ is the ‘goal’ of blind energy.

While the baseline LLM will do its best to formulate an answer, the RAG model can be instructed to not provide answers unless the info chunks provided by the RAG explicitly mention the topic. "

These shapes are shapes of a world, located in time and space. The previous shapes, even if they presupposed a background culture, were primarily shapes of individ- ual consciousness. Hegel summarizes the whole development of spirit. It begins with the tightly knit ethical life of the Greek city-state. This is rent apart by its self-knowledge, leading to the abstract ‘right’ of the Roman Empire, which sets the Self in opposition to the substance. Division persists in the history of Europe down to the French revolution: there are two realms, that of culture (the hither side) and that of faith (the beyond).\n",

The Latin verb also gave rise to speculum, ‘mirror’, and Hegel’s usage is often said to involve mirroring: see e.g. Enc. But speculum is only a minor member of the specul-family, and there is no trace in Hegel of a link between ‘speculation’ and mirrors. I,  112 Addition associates mirrors with ‘reflection’ rather than speculation. III, Hegel explicitly distinguishes three stages of spirit: ‘subjective spirit’ (roughly, the individual mind), ‘objective spirit’ (the collective social life of a people), and ‘absolute spirit’ (art, religion, and philosophy). He does not draw this distinction explicitly in PS, and tends to call the individual mind the ‘soul’ (Seele) rather than the ‘spirit’: see  77. Geist’s wide range of senses (including the ‘holy spirit’) and its tendency develop from one to the other, as well as its tendency to embrace what is other than Geist, make it an especially suitable candidate for the status of the absolute. I capitalize ‘State’ in the political sense in order to distinguish it from ‘state’ in the sense of ‘condition’ (Zustand), as in  477, where ‘state of right’ is Rechtszustand, not Rechtsstaat.\n",

      "Then the connection with proposition (ii) is this: if the absolute is only substance, it cannot develop into a system; it can only do so if it is also an active, purposive subject. However, Hegel may instead, or even also, be continuing his subjective use of ‘system’, which also makes decent sense of (ii): ‘The true or absolute is only completely actualized when it is presented in a system by us, for only then does it fully recover itself in its creation. ’ This suggests that the ‘subject’ in (ii) is not only an active subject, but also a knowing, system-building subject. This eases the introduction of spirit. Here Hegel speaks of ‘the spiritual’ (das Geistige) as well as of ‘spirit’ (Geist), perhaps because he is discussing the emergence and development of spirit, which begins not from fully fledged spirit, but the spiritual aspect of ordinary life. This is initially embedded in substance, rather than free and independent (‘in-and-for-itself ’): it is ‘spiritual substance’ (geistige Substanz), an expression that recurs in PS   26 and 36 as well as in chapter VI. That ‘the spiritual alone is the actual’ means that only the spiritual has the power to undertake the following process: (1) It is the ‘essence’ or ‘in itself ’, it has an intrinsic nature that does not depend on its relationships to other things or, more specifically, on its being revealed to itself or to others. (2) It encounters itself in a determinate form, as if it sees itself in a mirror.\n",

Secondly, everyone is an I: the word ‘I’ is applicable by everyone to him- or herself. The first sentence seems to refer to the first type of universality, but Hegel’s primary concern is the second. The final sentence refers obliquely to Wilhelm Traugott Krug’s challenge to the new idealists to deduce the pen he is writing with: see Di Giovanni and Harris (1985), pp. The challenge would be illegitimate if it were impossible to refer to Krug’s pen, and even for Krug to refer to himself.

      "He makes some attempt to correlate early stages of his Logic with stages in the history of philosophy, the concept of pure Being corresponding to Parmenides and that of becoming to Heraclitus, but thereafter his attempt to correlate the two orders becomes piecemeal and arbitrary. On the face of it, much of PS is not correlated with history, and those parts of it that are fall into three distinct historical sequences: from early Greece and/or the state of nature down to medieval Christianity (Self-consciousness: the struggle for recognition- Stoicism–Scepticism–the Unhappy Consciousness), from the Greek city-state to the French revolution and Kantian morality (Spirit), and from ancient Persia or thereabouts down to the Reformation (Religion). Critics of Hegel, such as Adolf Trendelenberg (1802–1872) and Hermann Lotze (1816–1881), have long argued that Hegel’s belief that concepts are embedded in extra-logical things and determine their structure as well as, in some cases, their development over time, is fallacious. On their view the dialectic that is supposed to power the transition from one concept to another, relies on a confusion between logical negation and physical concepts such as repulsion. Hegel tends to equate the structure of reality (the order of Being) with the structure of our thoughts about reality (the order of knowing), as if abstract concepts were objective forces, not only driving us on from one concept to the next, but also at work causally within the world. He did not regard concepts such as Being as simply abstractions; concepts are embedded in things in something like the way in which the genetic code of a plant is embedded in a seed: cf. The temporal development of such things as do develop over time—philosophy, history, shapes of consciousness—should therefore correspond to the logical order in which thoughts develop. However, he gives no clear criterion for deciding when a logical sequence gives rise to a corresponding temporal sequence, and when it does not, and again it is unclear where he locates the boundary between the two cases.\n",

Hegel has in mind the development of his own system rather than the human body, when he speaks of the becoming of a ‘determinate simplicity’, e.g. the shape of consciousness that emerges from the ruins of its predecessor, and of its passing over into a ‘higher truth’, e.g. the more advanced shape of consciousness. On substance as subject, see   17f. In  18 the reflection into itself is that of the substance-subject, and so it must be here too, though grammatically (seine eigene reflexion) it could be that of the ‘content’: the content is the ‘Being-there’ that the substance-subject generates. Hegel is now trying to show that its generation of Being-there and the subsequent dissolution of that Being-there and its replacement by another is a deep conceptual necessity. He is also trying to show that his own knowledge of this process is not an additional supplement that comes to substance from outside, but is involved in the very logic of substance itself. The first aim is approached by way of a brief replay of the dialectic of Being-there and quality, as found e.g. in Enc. A particular ‘Being-there’ has a quality with which it is indissolubly associated and which differentiates it from any other Being-there: see Enc.\n",

The subject ‘becomes other’ when a predicate is ascribed to it: e.g. if we say ‘Man is an animal’, man becomes other than himself, namely an animal. But if we add a further predicate, ‘rational’, we restore man to his original status, only on a higher, more explicit plane: ‘Man is a rational animal’. The absolute is more complex, but the principle is the same. We start by saying, e.g. ‘The absolute is pure Being’, which makes it other than itself, and eventually (by the end of Hegel’s Logic, at least by the end of his system) we arrive at a way of speaking about the absolute that is adequate to it and restores it to its initial grandeur. Hegel’s Logic can be seen initially as a series of predications of the absolute or God. Here Hegel agrees with Aquinas and disagrees with Plotinus.

That men (or ‘we’) collectively have supreme power does not entail that each individual does; he may well find other men as much of a nuisance as the gods were.

In the ethical life, the Self is submerged in the spirit of its people, it is universality filled. But simple singularity arises out of this content, and its levity refines it into a person, into the abstract universality of right. In this universality the reality of the ethical spirit is lost and, empty of content, the spirits of the national individuals are gathered into a single pantheon, not a pantheon of representation whose powerless form lets each spirit go its own way, but the pantheon of abstract universality, of pure thought, which disembodies them and assigns Being in- and for- itself to the spiritless Self, to the singular person. But this Self has, through its emptiness, let the content go free; consciousness is the essence only within itself; its own Being-there, the juridical recognition of the person, is the unfilled abstraction; it possesses, therefore, rather only the thought of itself; or as it is there and knows itself as object, it is the consciousness that is not actual. Hence it is only the stoical independence of thinking, and this, passing through the movement of the sceptical consciousness, finds its truth in that shape which was called the unhappy self-consciousness.

As the opposition between the true and the false becomes firmly fixed for opinion, 1 opinion tends to expect either assent or contradiction in response to a current philosophical system, and to see in any comment on such a system only the one or the other. Opinion does not comprehend the diversity of philosophical systems as the progressive unfolding of the truth; rather it sees in the diversity only contradiction.

Yet at the same time their fluid nature makes them moments of the organic unity, in which they not only do not conflict, but each is as necessary as the other; and this shared --- necessity alone constitutes the life of the whole.

Scepticism was in utter disarray, e.g. doubting the reliability of sense-perception and ethical laws, yet dependent on them: cf.\n",

      "This is to be found in the beautiful soul, which remains enclosed in its concept, i.e. is averse to any action whatsoever. It is not only the intuition of God, as in religion, but God’s intuition of Himself, since there can be no god outside the Self: cf. we saw the beautiful soul’s reluctance to act, but also its positive self-estrangement and its realization of its concept in action. Then it actualizes its pure knowledge of itself in the world, not in the Beyond, as religion does. (The beautiful soul has some affinity to Hegel himself. The secular conflict and reconciliation of  660 is now applied to the conflict between religion and the moral Self. The simple concept required both the action of spirit and the representational content of religion. In religion this content was other than consciousness, while in the acting spirit it is all within the Self.\n",

      "Somehow the unity of the thing needs to be maintained along with the diversity of its properties. The illusion to which perceiving is susceptible is not primarily ordinary perceptual illusions (such as seeing a stick in water look bent, when it is really straight), but an intellectual apprehension that fails to maintain its internal coherence or the ‘equality-to- itself ’ (Sichselbstgleichheit) of the thing. However, perception is susceptible to ordinary --- perceptual illusions of a sort that sensory certainty was not, since perception opens up a gap between itself and its object that was not present in sensory certainty. That is, ein Meinen, a relic of sensory certainty. Hegel replays the tensions that he discerned in perception in   113–15, but now as they present themselves to consciousness itself. It vacillates between regarding the thing as a medium or ‘community’ for its properties and regarding it as an intrinsic unity, whose properties are shared with and/or contrast with those of other things. It attributes its difficulties not to the internal incoherence of the thing, but to its own misapprehen- sions. It is in danger of lapsing back into the unarticulated ‘sensory Being’ of sensory certainty.\n",

      ") A concept is intrinsically and entirely mine, but it is not clear that its application is similarly independent of sensory input or that an object to which the concept is applied is not distinct from myself: ‘Jumbo is alive’ seems little different in this respect from ‘Jumbo is an elephant’. Hence Hegel is somewhat hazy about whether ‘thinking’ is about concepts or, alternatively, in terms of concepts, applying them to things that are conceptualized, but not themselves concepts. Probably he has in mind thinking about concepts, since in the final sentence he says that this ‘element’ (viz. the concepts) does not engage in the ‘development and movement of its manifold Being’. Hegel applies to consciousness the expression that in   156ff. he applied to the like poles of a magnet: sich gleichnamige, literally ‘like-named to itself ’ or ‘homonymous with itself ’. Consciousness repels itself, as two like poles repel each other, and thus bifurcates into the thinking I and the concepts it thinks. Stoicism is so-called from the Stoa poikilē, the ‘painted porch’, a colonnade in Athens, where Zeno of Citium opened his school c.399 .\n",

      "In response to your question, Hegel used the analogy of blossoms and buds to explain the progression and development of philosophical ideas. In a philosophical context, Hegel stated that the bud disappears when the blossom bursts forth, and similarly, when the fruit appears, the blossom is declared to be a false being-there of the plant. He described how these forms are not only different but also supplant one another as mutually incompatible. However, despite this apparent contradiction, Hegel emphasized that these different stages of growth are necessary moments of the organic unity, each as vital as the other. The shared necessity of these different phases constitutes the life of the whole plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through this analogy, Hegel was highlighting the fluid nature of philosophical progress and the evolution of ideas. Just as a plant transitions from a bud to a blossom to a fruit, philosophical systems succeed one another, each building upon and, in a sense, negating the previous one. This process of negation and progression is essential for the advancement and development of philosophical thought. Hegel's use of the blossom and bud analogy reflects his belief in the intricate and interconnected nature of philosophical concepts, where each phase of growth is crucial for the overall understanding and evolution of philosophical ideas.\n"

      "In Hegel's dialectical method, reality is seen as a process of continual development and change, where everything is in a constant state of becoming. This process follows a triadic pattern of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of blossoms and buds, we can think of buds as the initial stage of development, representing the thesis. Buds contain the potential for growth and transformation, but they have not yet fully developed. As the bud grows and matures, it undergoes a process of negation or opposition, represented by the antithesis. This may be in the form of challenges, obstacles, or conflicts that the bud must overcome in order to fully develop. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the bud reaches a state of full bloom, where it has integrated the opposing forces and reached a state of harmony and completeness. This represents the synthesis, where the potential of the bud has been fully realized and manifested in the form of a beautiful blossom. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while Hegel did not directly discuss blossoms and buds, we can apply his dialectical method to understand the process of growth and development in nature and in human life. The process of blossoming from a bud can be seen as a reflection of the larger dialectical process of becoming and achieving completeness.\n"
